Due to confidentiality I have responded in more depth to the complaint you raised directly with the Practice via our website.\nI am sorry you have had a bad experience during your recent consultation. I would like to reassure you that all of our Treatment Room staff are fully trained in phlebotomy. \nOur nursing team is trained to university level and phlebotomy would have course been a basic part of this training. Our HCAs are trained in phlebotomy and many other areas so they are able to carry out a range of consultations which benefit our patients where as a Practice Phlebotomist would only be able perform blood tests. The Practice offers a range of services which other practices do not and we hope this helps our patients as coming to the surgery is often the most convenient option for them. You can however, if you wish, ask for your blood test form to be printed by us and then you have the option of attending hospital to have your bloods taken.\nThe Treatment Room staff take bloods routinely and during January alone there were 1130 appointments where blood samples were taken. Our GPs do not routinely take bloods, and while they are trained to do so, our Treatment Room staff are far more experienced as they do this daily. Due to the size of our nursing and HCA team, a GP appointment for bloods would not be something the Practice would be able to offer you as patients are signposted to the most relevant clinician for their requirements and this helps to free up GP appointments for those that really need them.\nI have spoken to the staff who attempted to take your blood sample during your last appointment and I have also discuss the issue with Sarah who is our Senior Practice Nurse. Sarah has advised that the Treatment Room staff have found it difficult to take blood samples with multiple patients over the last couple of weeks. She explained that the cold weather coupled with a known issue with the heating in the health centre which had been reported to the owner of the building and has now been rectified was making it more difficult for them to take a blood sample on the first attempt. This is because being cold can cause your veins to constrict and therefore be harder to find. She also advised that unfortunately some people are just easier to get blood from than others but there are things patients can do to try and make this process easier and that just attending the appointment can often cause some anxiety and blood pressure to rise. Sarah also explained that simple things like drinking enough water prior to your appointment can also help and felt that the link below may be useful for you:\nHow to prepare for a blood test | Patient\nI hope this response has helped to answer your concerns but if you wish to discuss your concerns further please do not hesitate to contact me.\nKind regards\nKathryn Armstrong\nOffice Manager\n","dateOfSubmission":"2023-01-31T16:29:24","dateOfPublication":"2023-02-01T09:49:40","changeMessage":null,"source":"nhsc","changeScore":null,"countHelpful":0,"countNotHelpful":0,"links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1025127?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1025127"},{"rel":"responding-to","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1023492?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1023492"}]},{"id":1025126,"respondingToOpinionId":1023161,"signature":"Warwick Road Surgery","body":"Dear Katie\nWe are very sorry you are disappointed with the service received.

There was also a problem with the econsult technology that we are currently looking into, that created a bit of a bottle neck – but we usually see between 180 and 250 econsults per week and as you would expect a disproportionate number land on a Monday, and if there are problems with the system then we see more phone traffic as a result.\n\nWe are trying to work out the processes to have a straightforward email for the reception team for nonclinical queries to save patients needing to log onto the econsult system and again hopefully relieve the pressures on the phone, but the simple fact at the moment is that the need and demand for our services far outstrips the availability of resource that we have, as is the case across the country and across the NHS as a whole – I really wish it wasn’t the case. We are trying to recruit to fill our 2 vacancies but there simply aren’t enough qualified GP’s out there who are prepared to work in a traditional practice based role.  \n\nI hope this goes someway to answering your concerns but please contact the surgery directly (either Ian Taylor, Patient Services Manager or in his absence me) if you need any further information or assistance.\n\nKind regards,\nFiona Purdie \nBusiness Manager\n\n","dateOfSubmission":"2023-01-31T16:50:47","dateOfPublication":"2023-02-01T09:52:04","changeMessage":null,"source":"nhsc","changeScore":null,"countHelpful":0,"countNotHelpful":0,"links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1025123?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1025123"},{"rel":"responding-to","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1024068?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1024068"}]},{"id":1025122,"respondingToOpinionId":1022037,"signature":"The St. Clements Surgery","body":"Dear Patient,\n\nThank you for your feedback.\n\nI am happy to hear you are pleased with your care at the surgery and will share with the team.\n\nKind regards\nSadia Hanif\nPractice Manager","dateOfSubmission":"2023-01-31T16:54:56","dateOfPublication":"2023-02-01T09:52:34","changeMessage":null,"source":"nhsc","changeScore":null,"countHelpful":0,"countNotHelpful":0,"links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1025122?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1025122"},{"rel":"responding-to","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1022037?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1022037"}]},{"id":1025121,"respondingToOpinionId":1021390,"signature":"Sangam Practice","body":"Dear Patient\nThank you for providing the positive feedback .

We are very aware of the access issues and the current levels of demand that are being seen locally and nationally – our local medical committee has asked us to report to them on a weekly basis about the workload pressures that are being seen right across Bradford and the rest of Yorkshire so I am also well aware that we are not alone with this pressure. \n\nIt’s very difficult to answer specific issues, such as follow up after cancer recovery, when you are posting anonymously and publicly so I can only provide general comments to the points that you have raised. Whenever someone is discharged back to primary care from any secondary care department then we take our instructions from that discharge communication, however, in general, if regular follow up is required then that should be arranged and completed within the secondary care department. There can be some ongoing medication that needs to be set up which might account for the follow up appointment you mention but we really would not expect there to be a regular programme of follow up in practice without a formal “shared care” arrangement being set up and in the very large part they tend to be about  regular blood tests with a plan to refer back in if the results come back as abnormal. This would not be a usual ongoing issue for cancer patients. But without being able to look at your specific situation I am not able to see if there has been a particular problem I need to look at.\n\nWe work quite hard to try and reduce the groups of patients sitting together in the waiting room, we ae still telephoning the vast majority of our patients in the first instance but as of last week we saw around 80% of our total appointments face to face, although we recognise that for our doctors that may only be for as long as the appropriate examination needed takes.

We have appointments set aside for 111 to book patients into when we are at this stage, so that our patients are safe. This is the only advice our receptionists can give at that point. As I’m sure you are aware, we are under great pressure and our appointments are at a premium. We are not deliberately making things difficult unfortunately we can only book into available appointments, as much as we would like to help our patients. If your need is urgent, please call us again to discuss, however our telephone lines do not open until 8.30.

Lawrence, Patient Experience Manager, NHS 24","body":"Dear oscaryt66  \r\nI’m so sorry to learn of your mother’s fall from her bed. This sounds like a worrying time for you both. I hope she is doing well following her ordeal.  \r\nThank you so much for sharing your experience of her journey of care. All staff sound as though they did a fantastic job in providing care tailored to your mum’s needs which I'm sure was hugely reassuring for you.  \r\nI see you made a call to NHS 24 when you spoke with our staff who then arranged onward care for your mother. You are absolutely correct when you mention the importance of being ‘human’. As NHS 24 staff don’t have the benefit of seeing our patients face to face, we work hard to ensure we are still able to provide person-centred care, not only for the patient, but also for the caller too when they have concerns about the health of a loved one.  \r\nThe staff at St John’s sound great, so well done to them for checking your mother for broken bones and in providing advice in relation to pain management. I am sure all of this would have been very reassuring for you.  \r\nGreat communication too from the Rapid Response Team, especially in taking the time to check on your mother’s condition.  \r\nThanks again and best wishes to you both. Should you care to share any further detail about your call to 111, it would be great to hear from you. You can call me on 07814 299944. This would also allow me to share your kind words with our staff.  \r\nTake care  \r\nShona","dateOfSubmission":"2023-02-01T11:41:00.057","dateOfPublication":"2023-02-01T11:41:09.233","changeMessage":"No specific claim has been made","source":"co","changeScore":0,"countHelpful":3,"countNotHelpful":0,"links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1024653?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1024653"},{"rel":"responding-to","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1018092?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1018092"}]},{"id":1024654,"respondingToOpinionId":1021070,"signature":"Tracey Taylor, Operational Manager, Nottingham City Community Mental Health Services, Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust","body":"Hello Anopm73  \r\nI have just seen your email and replied to you  \r\nKind regards, Tracey","dateOfSubmission":"2023-02-01T11:43:00.08","dateOfPublication":"2023-02-01T11:43:01.203","changeMessage":"No specific claim has been made","source":"co","changeScore":0,"countHelpful":0,"countNotHelpful":0,"links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1024654?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1024654"},{"rel":"responding-to","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1021070?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1021070"}]},{"id":1024663,"respondingToOpinionId":1023661,"signature":"Margaret Barlow, Interim Lead Nurse, Endoscopy, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde","body":"Hi Bamenda  \r\nThank you very much for your kind words and appreciation following your visit to Endoscopy at Gartnavel General Hospital.
