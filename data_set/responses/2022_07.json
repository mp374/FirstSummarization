I'm not sure why you haven't been able to meet your named GP. We regard continuity of care and patients having their own GP as very important. We have had some issues with sickness recently so it's possible that is why you haven't met your GP first. I'm also not sure why when you telephoned the practice, you didn't get a call back. We run a telephone first system for making appointments so expect to ring back everyone that books a telephone appointment. Possibly something went wrong.  \r\nPlease do come in to the surgery and speak to the reception manager as she can then make some enquiries and work out what went wrong so that we can improve things. I am also concerned that you felt 'not listened to'. I would be surprised as all our doctors are concerned about our patients and strive to give the best care possible. Again, constructive feedback is very useful as it can help us improve our communications and care we offer.

The GP will then call the patient on the nominated day, either am or pm,  and following consultation will decide if a face to face appointment is required and the GP will then book this.  We understand this can be frustrating but this is the current system.

Unfortunately, we cannot arrange consultations in this way.  All our patients would like to be able to have such a system but it is not possible.  We have to be able to offer all patients the same service and, therefore all patients are requested to telephone the practice and the team will arrange for a telephone consultation and the GP to call you back on the designated day and time period (AM or PM).   Demand is at an all time high and we are endeavouring to provide the best service we can with the resources we have available.  Should you feel that the practice is not providing you with the level of service you require you are at liberty to register at another local practice of your choice.  Please be assured that the staff all care and will ask for basic details about your condition as the GPs have asked them to do this so the GP can then triage their appointment list.  We regret that we cannot offer a message and ring back service to our patient list.  The team work outside of NHS hours just to help with the daily workload.
