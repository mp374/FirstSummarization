Due to the increased demand on GP services, we may, at times advise appropriate alternative services. Alternatively, if you wish to request a non-urgent triage appointment, you can visit this website link: https://florey.accurx.com/p/C88041and complete a questionnaire regarding your symptoms, you will then receive a text within 2 working days to notify you of the outcome of your request.

We ask patients that require a routine appointment to call in after this time to help relieve pressures off the appointment system.  \n\nAlternatively, the practice has also introduced the ‘Queue Buster’ option. This option allows you to disconnect your call but will hold your position in the queue.

During and since the pandemic there has been a huge increase in patient demand on our services, a fact I’m sure you are well aware of if you also work in the NHS.  This has manifested in increased telephone calls into the surgery. This has also meant that our telephone system is overwhelmed on occasion.  Depending on your reason for calling the surgery there are better times to get through than others.  If you are calling for test results or with a query, later in the day is a better time to call as the morning is when most callers are calling for an appointment.  We advise patients to use our online services as much as possible, as this means you don’t need to come in or call the surgery, however we do understand that some patients may not have easy access to or be able to use the online system or will need to speak to or see a clinician.  We are investigating a new telephony system to try to improve our telephone service to our patients and have recruited new staff who are in training.  The receptionist role both on the telephone and in person has become very challenging and they often have to deal with abuse from frustrated patients; this does not make it easy to recruit or keep new staff.  We always do our very best to provide a helpful, pleasant and professional service despite these difficulties and we will continue to do so.    \nRegards\nChristina Moran, Patient Services Manager\n","dateOfSubmission":"2022-09-01T11:18:37","dateOfPublication":"2022-09-01T11:20:15","changeMessage":null,"source":"nhsc","changeScore":null,"countHelpful":0,"countNotHelpful":0,"links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/971454?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"971454"},{"rel":"responding-to","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/970081?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"970081"}]},{"id":971442,"respondingToOpinionId":968286,"signature":"Brid France, Midwifery Sister CAH, Acute, SHSCT","body":"Many thanks for taking time to provide this positive feedback.
