I had an appointment at the rheumatology department at Glasgow Royal Infirmary as I also have bones chipped off from my patella (Loose Bodies) the cartilage has also worn away. This was confirmed via X-ray and an MRI scan. After getting an appointment to see a surgeon I mentioned to the doctor that I had left sided hip pain as well. He said it was probably over compensation for the injury in my right knee.  \r\nA week later the pain in my left thigh was so severe I couldn’t walk so I had to call the surgery to ask for another home visit. This time a doctor came out examined me at home and confirmed that my thigh muscle was in constant spasm and that’s why it was so painful. She prescribed 5 days of muscle relaxants and said that should be fine.  \r\nI’m now on day 6 and although the pain has eased slightly it is still very painful and I’m having to use crutches to get about the house and even that is very painful.  \r\nI’m actually afraid to call my surgery again after the first incident. I’m still housebound, can’t drive my car or walk to a shop but the first incident has made me so anxious that I think they will either not believe me or not come out after having the same problem in two different places in a month.  \r\nI just want to make you aware how patients with chronic illnesses feel intimidated when calling about other problems.  \r\nI’d rather try and get a lift to A&E than have to call back.  \r\nThank you for listening.","dateOfSubmission":"2022-05-01T21:56:00.023","dateOfPublication":"2022-05-03T09:10:19.417","changeMessage":null,"source":"co","changeScore":null,"countHelpful":0,"countNotHelpful":0,"links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/935624?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"935624"},{"rel":"responding-to","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/928873?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"928873"}]},{"id":935807,"respondingToOpinionId":931543,"signature":"Kate Stoneman, Quality Improvement Lead, Safer Care Team, Bromley Healthcare","body":"Dear penguin01,  \r\nMany thanks for taking the time to share your experience of Talk Together Bromley.

Patient feedback good or bad is incredibly important to us and helps us to improve our services. \n\nI'm sorry that you have had difficulty in getting through to us. The practice has recently experienced unprecedented demand and we will often receive high volumes of calls, particularly in a morning or in the period leading up to a public holiday. To mitigate these times of high call volume we installed a queuing system to make it fairer to our patients as before this new system you would just receive an engaged tone once the lines were full and would need to try multiple times to get through which I hope you'd agree is not a fair way of doing things. Additionally, to ensure people aren't waiting in the queue for a long time we have installed a \"callback\" feature which keeps your place in the queue and calls you back once you reach the front of the queue, allowing you to go about your day without waiting on the phone.\n\nAlso, if you have an enquiry in future that doesn't require an appointment you can do this using the E-Consult service at the link below or the NHS App. Questions submitted on this system come directly and securely to a member of staff here and then are actioned appropriately. \n\nhttps://collingwoodsurgery.webgp.com/\n\nAlthough you feel that the difficulties you've had is down to the merger with Appleby Surgery I can assure you it isn't. We actually have more reception and admin staff per patient than we did pre-merger so the difficulties you have faced are indicative of the pressure that all practices in the area are currently under. \n\nOnce again i'm sorry that you've had difficulty getting through on the occasions you mention. If you would like to email the practice and identify yourself i'd be more than happy to discuss this with you in more detail over the phone or in person. Our email address is collingwood.surgery@nhs.net\n\nKind regards,\n\nDavid Pierce\nPractice Manager","dateOfSubmission":"2022-05-03T09:48:11","dateOfPublication":"2022-05-03T17:11:20","changeMessage":null,"source":"nhsc","changeScore":null,"countHelpful":0,"countNotHelpful":0,"links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/936079?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"936079"},{"rel":"responding-to","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/935548?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"935548"}]},{"id":936023,"respondingToOpinionId":933071,"signature":"Derriford Hospital","body":"I'm sorry to hear your views on your husbands stay with us.
