Iâ€™m so pleased you received a first class service in the Minor Injuries and Illness unit (MIIU) in Arbroath Infirmary.  \r\nThe way we access urgent care has changed and patients are now asked to call NHS 24 prior to attending our service. This is to ensure that patients are seen in the right place, by the right person, the first time they seek help. This is a Scottish government initiative and is also to help reduce long waits in overcrowded hospital waiting rooms. Iâ€™m sorry you had a long wait to arrange the appointment, unfortunately we have no control over this and it is dependent on how busy NHS 24 is at the time of your call.  \r\nStaff in MIIU work really hard to ensure that all patients receive professional and compassionate care and itâ€™s very reassuring to know that the staff were wonderful. I agree that they are also Angels!  \r\nI hope your wound is healing well and you have no further problems with it. Dog bites can be nasty wounds and very painful. The name youâ€™ve used in your story gives me the impression that you may have an increased risk of dog bites! I hope you manage to escape any further injuries and we would also like to thank you for the terrific job you do itâ€™s also much appreciated.  \r\nIâ€™ll pass your lovely comments onto staff within the service and Iâ€™m sure like me they will be delighted you were happy with your treatment.  \r\nTake care.  \r\nKind Regards  \r\nAnne Black  \r\nSenior Charge Nurse MIIU/OOH","dateOfSubmission":"2022-04-01T11:37:00.08","dateOfPublication":"2022-04-01T11:37:15.92","changeMessage":"No specific claim has been made","source":"co","changeScore":0,"countHelpful":0,"countNotHelpful":0,"links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/928415?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"928415"},{"rel":"responding-to","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/925694?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"925694"}]},{"id":928417,"respondingToOpinionId":928227,"signature":"Sinead Morrow, Senior Nurse Non Acute Hospitals, OPPC, SHSCT","body":"Thank you for taking the time to leave feedback for ward 2.  \r\nI will forward your lovely comments to the team in ward 2.  \r\nWishing you a speedy recovery.  \r\nThanks Sinead","dateOfSubmission":"2022-04-01T11:45:00.103","dateOfPublication":"2022-04-01T11:45:08.447","changeMessage":"No specific claim has been made","source":"co","changeScore":0,"countHelpful":0,"countNotHelpful":0,"links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/928417?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"928417"},{"rel":"responding-to","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/928227?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"928227"}]},{"id":928418,"respondingToOpinionId":928072,"signature":"Conor Campbell, Safe and Effective Care Senior Manager, Safe & Effective Care, South Eastern Health & Social Care Trust","body":"Hi Brenda13  \r\nThank you for sharing your story.  \r\nGreat to hear that you were so well looked after and found the hospital environment to be of good quality standard.  \r\nOur nursing and cleaning teams will really appreciate your positive feedback.  \r\nBest wishes  \r\nConor","dateOfSubmission":"2022-04-01T11:46:00.093","dateOfPublication":"2022-04-01T11:46:27.73","changeMessage":"No specific claim has been made","source":"co","changeScore":0,"countHelpful":1,"countNotHelpful":0,"links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/928418?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"928418"},{"rel":"responding-to","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/928072?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"928072"}]},{"id":928419,"respondingToOpinionId":925631,"signature":"Anne Black, Senior Charge Nurse, Minor Injuries Service/ Out of Hours, NHS Tayside","body":"Dear Sarahhd  \r\nThank you for taking the time to post your story on care opinion, itâ€™s much appreciated.

Due to the individual and anonymised nature of your comments I am unable to contact you to help you with your issue.  Please call Surgery on 02085272563 and ask for Suzia or if you have difficulty getting through on the phone you can send an email to Penrhyn.surgery@nhs.net and I will contact you myself.  \nI do apologise for the delay you experienced in accessing our phone and appointment system We could list many reasons as to why our phone service is currently very busy and I am sure you  already may know some of the reasons for this, such as staff shortages, covid vaccine queries, recent travel changes and vaccinations or patients calling to order a repeat prescription only to be told we don't do this over the telephone, registered and non registered people calling and travelling Covid passports and much more.\nYour comment however raises an important point which is we need a better system and we are confident you will be happy to hear that we listen to our patientâ€™s feedback and have now started working with EQUIPP to implement a Total Triage model in our Practice. \nTotal triage means that every patient contacting the practice is first triaged before making an appointment. \nThe purpose of total triage is to get patient need met by the most appropriate person or service with the minimum amount of handoff.  \nThe total triage model aims to help practices better meet patient demand within their existing capacity by using the skill-mix of the wider team, utilising online services, telephone and video consultations as well as face-to-face consultations when needed.\nTotal Digital Triage would not let any patient put routine appointment if they write urgent symptoms of condition if they do so they will be directed to 111 or A&E. In your case if any urgent symptoms were added which was not the case and you just needed an appointment with GP then it you will be asked to return to the form and complete it appropriately. I would appreciate it that you make an appointment with me at surgery so I can show you live appointment system and how we work hard to make it fair for all patients so each and every patient registered can access the service and not wait for 8am to get an appointment.\n\nWe understand that not all of our patients are able to access online services, and hope that their friends and families can help them (with their consent of course). By doing this it will then free up our telephone line resources so patients who cannot access the online services are then able to get through to us much quicker. We are happy to hear from our patients on this and welcome any feedback you may have to help us help you better.  \nMany Thanks \nManagement Team at Penrhyn Surgery ","dateOfSubmission":"2022-03-31T21:09:38","dateOfPublication":"2022-04-01T21:30:57","changeMessage":null,"source":"nhsc","changeScore":null,"countHelpful":0,"countNotHelpful":0,"links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/928578?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"928578"},{"rel":"responding-to","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/926063?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"926063"}]},{"id":928577,"respondingToOpinionId":918202,"signature":"The Penrhyn Surgery","body":"We are glad that are were able to provide a very caring service as well as excellent medical treatment to all our patients in these challenging times.

Face to face appointments are given for a spectrum of reasons from urgent problems to routine smears and chronic disease reviews.\nAppointments and consultations can be made online through the link on our website. We also offer the additional choice of being able to make appointments over the phone to ensure equality of access for those who may not be able to go online or use digital technology. The appointments are varied throughout the day to give opportunity for those that may struggle to contact us in the morning or to address health issues that arise later in the day. Telephone consultations are with appropriate clinicians who can determine, with the patient, the most suitable next step to manage the problem. This can be a video consultation which is done immediately or a face-to-face consultation within 24 hours with a doctor/nurse/HCA/ physicians-associate/pharmacist depending on what is required. Telephone, face to face, online and video consultations will continue for the foreseeable future.\n3)\tPhone Lines\nThe practice has listened to the patients and liaised with several telephony companies to improve our telephone system.\nI am happy to inform you that we have installed a new telephone system, which went live on 18/03/2022. The new system is deployed in more than 1,000 GP surgeries, serving an estimated 10 million patients across England and Wales. The new system has allowed the surgery to transition from legacy phone systems to a fully flexible, adaptable, and always up-to-date multi-site system that continually meets the significant demands made on a practice.\nIf you have any further queries please do not hesitate to contact the surgery.\n","dateOfSubmission":"2022-04-01T14:51:08","dateOfPublication":"2022-04-02T05:23:14","changeMessage":null,"source":"nhsc","changeScore":null,"countHelpful":0,"countNotHelpful":0,"links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/928711?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"928711"},{"rel":"responding-to","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/927549?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"927549"}]},{"id":928710,"respondingToOpinionId":880111,"signature":"Wellfield Medical Centre","body":"Dear Patient, Please accept our apology for the way you feel you have been dealt with.

Unfortunately, at times this can feel quite restrictive when all a patient really wants to do is see a doctor.  \n\nAs part of our internal system for processing eConsult requests, our administration staff would send a specific message to the patient acknowledging the request with an approximate date that the doctor would respond.  Sometimes this differed to the information being sent by the eConsult system itself which would cause confusion and annoyance to patients. Unfortunately, this message sent from the eConsult system was not able to be configured by the practice.\n\nThe uptake of patients using the eConsult service far exceeded the expected and modelled scenarios we were anticipating and as a result of this, the time taken to respond to queries was longer than envisioned.\n\nI do apologise for the delay in responding back to your comment which was posted back in April 2021 but as we now know, the temporary lull we were experiencing at that time, resulted in further lockdowns and the arrival of the Omicron variant of the virus.\n\nWe are now in April 2022 and I am pleased to say that we are now going to a more traditional set up for our appointments.  We are reintroducing face to face appointments and a selection of appointments can be booked either online using Patient Access or via the telephone up to 28 days in advance. \n\nWe are still experiencing high volumes of calls from patients, who as you suggest, may have put off calling the doctor.  To those patients we would say, please make an appointment to see a doctor in the coming weeks.\n\nKind regards\n\nStuart Hall\nPractice Manager\n","dateOfSubmission":"2022-04-01T17:47:11","dateOfPublication":"2022-04-02T05:50:19","changeMessage":null,"source":"nhsc","changeScore":null,"countHelpful":0,"countNotHelpful":0,"links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/928702?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"928702"},{"rel":"responding-to","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/842734?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"842734"}]},{"id":928701,"respondingToOpinionId":912438,"signature":"Woolstone Medical Centre","body":"Dear Patient\n\nThank you for taking the time to leave a review. The Practice takes all concerns raised by our patients seriously and we are sorry that you have been left disappointed with the service you have received recently.\n\nAs you will be aware, Covid-19 has put a tremendous strain on GP Practices and the NHS. To make sure that we continue to be able to remain open, we have over the last two years had to make changes to the way we run the surgery.\n\nI do apologise for the delay in responding back to your comment which was posted on 28 January 2022.\n\nWe offered telephone appointments to patients at a time when we were trying to limit the numbers of patients coming into the practice.  This was a system that allowed the doctors to triage over the telephone and if medically appropriate, they could ask the patient to come to the surgery for a face to face consultation and examination.\n\nWe will always endeavour to call patients back at the approximate time that they have been booked into a slot. However, sometimes a previous call may overrun or a doctor may be called upon in an emergency and we miss the slot. The doctors will always call the patient back at least twice, at differing times during their clinical session in the event the patient themselves were not able to get to their phone.  Examples of this happening in the past have been because they are away from their phone or driving at the time they are called.  Sometimes, the number we have on our system is incorrect.  \n\nUnfortunately, I do not know the reason why you were not called back on this occasion.\n\nI am sorry that you found our nursing staff unhelpful. You do not go into any particulars but I will say that Nurses in particular have been the saviours of General Practice over the last two years. When all clinics were going to telephones, they were expected to continue to see patients face to face for dressings, immunisations and examinations and for this they should be commended.\n\nWe are now in April 2022 and I am pleased to say that we are now going to a more traditional set up for our appointments.
