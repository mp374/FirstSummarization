Highlighting these issues and resolving them will involve considering various different obstacles we face as a GP surgery in the NHS today. Firstly, you have mentioned that the problems we face are not to do with funding, which I appreciate. However, the challenge we acknowledge is the ability to provide a service adequate for our vast population of 24,000 people. We are aiming to tackle this initial obstacle by recruiting GP registrars to help with the overwhelming pressures we face. We have a collection of 7 GP registrars who start with us this week, and we hope that this will show relief in our appointment structure.\n\nI also appreciate that you have mentioned various other methods of managing an appointment structure to help meet the needs of our patients who do not fit into the standard 8 am rush for appointments.\nAdapting to these conditions is essential for us to aim to become a better Practice. There have been times in the past we have trialed process' like this, e.g. releasing afternoon appointments at 11 am meaning there are two different times of the day for patients to book in to see us. This unfortunately did not work well at the time, however, we are still considering alternate methods of managing the structure which will be brought to our next appointments management meeting.\n\nYour latter suggestion is about having a message on our telephone line stating the time of day we book appointments. Unfortunately, this is not something that we can openly advertise before speaking to a Patient, as we cannot discourage anyone from getting through to us, in case they are experiencing an emergency, or have an issue that can be resolved with a different method from our Reception team. \n\nTo summarise, I do appreciate the points that you have made; they have been noted and will be discussed more within the Practice.\nI hope this information has been helpful, and I would be happy to discuss this in more detail, should you request via complaints.deepingspractice@nhs.net\n\nKind regards\nJoey Attwell\nThe Deepings Practice","dateOfSubmission":"2022-08-01T08:47:14","dateOfPublication":"2022-08-01T18:17:57","changeMessage":null,"source":"nhsc","changeScore":null,"countHelpful":0,"countNotHelpful":0,"links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/962230?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"962230"},{"rel":"responding-to","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/956791?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"956791"}]},{"id":962229,"respondingToOpinionId":923634,"signature":"Park House Medical Centre","body":"Thank you for your comments. I am truly sorry that your experience wasn't satisfactory with the Practice. We are trying our hardest to meet the needs of all of our 7500 patient population and presently the 8am distribution of appointments model is the one that we are having to use due to the complexity of the situation that we still find ourselves in post covid. I am honestly trying to come up with a solution that meets everyone's needs as I am a patient myself and experience the same frustrations that you do. In September we will have more GP's on staff in order to be able to allow us to offer a wider range of appointments, I appreciate that this doesn't help your situation at this present time but I need you to know that the GP's and staff at Park House work extremely hard, in very challenging circumstances, to try and help as many patients as possible.
