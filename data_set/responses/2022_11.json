I would like to introduce myself, my name is Olga O’Neill and I am the Interim Co Director for Unscheduled Care which includes our emergency care departments. I would like to offer my heartfelt apology for yours and your mothers experiences, this is not what I would want for any patient or family member, it also falls below the standard we would aim for.  \r\nI am so sorry that the table was not attached to your mother's trolley to enable her to take regular drinks, we will reiterate the importance of using the tray tables for patients to all staff. It is unacceptable that your mother had to wait to be assisted to the bathroom, I sincerely apologise for this. We do have an electronic system that holds all patient records and their location, I can only apologise about the staff members you spoke to and I agree that they should have found someone that could answer your questions. We will remind our ED staff as well as all other teams that attend the ED department of the importance of ensuring that our service users’ requests are responded to and that further assistance is sought if the staff member does not know the patient.  \r\nWhilst there is significant pressure in health care and especially in our emergency departments where patients are waiting unprecedented prolonged periods of time for an in-patient bed this does not excuse substandard care and distress to families. I can assure you that the issues you have raised will be ongoing items in our daily safety brief and team discussions, to reiterate the standards and attitudes that all our patients and their families should receive.  \r\nI do hope your mother is improving and doing well and I will pass on your sincere thanks and appreciation of the care that she received in the medical ward of level 7.
