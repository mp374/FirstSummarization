Amy was also able to help my husband feed baby while I was being sutured and struggling to breast feed.  \r\nJenny and Margaret were 2 midwives of many that cared for me and baby on the ward, they took the time to get to know me and my husband, Margaret especially. Margaret was a bucketful of knowledge and took the time to chat when she wasn’t attending to the other mothers. Chat does the mental health some good especially with covid restrictions still in place which prevents relatives other than partners from coming in.  \r\nThere was 2 midwifery students who will be fantastic as midwives when they qualify, their names were Rebecca and Natasha. No question was silly and they took the time to show and explain things.  \r\nI know time is an issue in the NHS as workload increases with more paperwork and short staff but no staff member made this known and always tried to help all the mothers and babies.

I will check with our Bookers that our clinic letter appointments are set up to match appointment times, as I can't explain why you would be told one time and be given a letter for a different time. Please accept my apologies for being called at a time other than you were expecting. I hope that the nurse checked with you that it was convenient for you, and you weren't made to feel obliged to proceed at that time.  \r\nI am not aware that any of my nurses have hearing difficulties that affect them on the telephone, but I will raise your comments with the whole team and address what we find.  \r\nThe purpose of the pre assessment is to both help you and the clinical teams to prepare for an anaesthetic. By establishing whether someone has any mental health needs before they come into hospital takes away the need to check again on the day of surgery. We intentionally ask this question generically as we must respect that some people do not like the intrusion whereas others are very keen to share details in the knowledge it will make their admission easier. If people share details, we can ask further questions to provide appropriate care for them on admission. I am sorry that you felt we were intrusive.  \r\nYour comments don't say the length of time Pre-Assessment advised you would have to wait post op before being discharged. This would vary according to if you had your procedure in the Oral Surgery Day Unit or Newlyn theatre and what type of anaesthetic you had or whether you had local anaesthetic and sedation, and whether you knew your place of admission at the time of the telephone assessment as well as many other factors including where you were placed on the operating list, staffing on the day of surgery and how you recover. Essentially what I am trying to explain is that at the time of assessment it can be difficult to predict this and please accept our apologies for getting it wrong for you.  \r\nRegarding eating after dental extraction, we would encourage patients to speak to the Oral Surgery team at the time of admission. The anaesthetic assessment nurse maybe should have directed you to the Oral Surgery team for specific advice about eating and I will ask that they do so in future.  \r\nPre-Assessment nurses are educated in preparing people for an anaesthetic rather than the fine detail of individual surgeries and individual surgeons. I always encourage pre assessment nurses to direct patients to the relevant surgical team for specific questions which I will reiterate to the team following your feedback.  \r\nThank you for your feedback I hope I have been the correct team to answer your queries and some of the rationale for our action makes sense.  \r\nClaire Richards","dateOfSubmission":"2022-06-01T14:52:00.05","dateOfPublication":"2022-06-01T14:52:05.077","changeMessage":"No specific claim has been made","source":"co","changeScore":0,"countHelpful":0,"countNotHelpful":0,"links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/944049?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"944049"},{"rel":"responding-to","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/942816?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"942816"}]},{"id":944050,"respondingToOpinionId":943604,"signature":"Christine Rock, Patient experience support officer., The Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust","body":"Thank you very much for taking the time to post comments regarding your recent patient experience.  \r\nI will share your comments with our staff and wish you well with your recovery.  \r\nKindest regards  \r\nAlison Dowling  \r\n**Head of Patient Experience and Public Involvement**","dateOfSubmission":"2022-06-01T14:56:00.073","dateOfPublication":"2022-06-01T14:56:08.427","changeMessage":"No specific claim has been made","source":"co","changeScore":0,"countHelpful":1,"countNotHelpful":0,"links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/944050?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"944050"},{"rel":"responding-to","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/943604?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"943604"}]},{"id":944055,"respondingToOpinionId":943614,"signature":"Sarah Horan, Director of Nursing, Midwifery & Allied Health Professionals, NHS Borders","body":"Dear Jedimum04  \r\nThank you for sharing your sons experience and I hope his arm is healing well, boys will indeed be boys regardless of age!  \r\nIts great to hear that you were able to choose to use 111 following both NHS 24 and NHS Borders advice on the best place to get the most appropriate care, as you both experienced having a time to attend after the call handlers did all the relevant checks makes it a much easier experience.  \r\nI am biased but know we have amazing nurses in NHS Borders who are so skilled at putting concerned and anxious people at ease, I will make sure that Norma sees this.  \r\nWith all best wishes","dateOfSubmission":"2022-06-01T15:02:00.06","dateOfPublication":"2022-06-01T15:02:04.397","changeMessage":"No specific claim has been made","source":"co","changeScore":0,"countHelpful":3,"countNotHelpful":0,"links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/944055?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"944055"},{"rel":"responding-to","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/943614?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"943614"}]},{"id":944058,"respondingToOpinionId":944011,"signature":"Gary Walls, Team Leader, Condition Management Programme, NHSCT","body":"Thank you for your kind feedback on your experience with the Condition Management Programme.

I am sorry to hear it was an unsatisfactory experience. In light of this, I would like to address each of your concerns individually.  \r\n1. On your journey through the Emergency department, you will, as a patient, encounter many staff from medical, administrative and auxiliary backgrounds. Children are one of the most vulnerable groups to attend our department, and for this reason, it is often necessary to question appropriately and regularly, in order to safeguard the child. I appreciate this may seem frustrating to you, however, the protection and welfare of the child is our paramount concern at all times.  \r\n2. Patients present to our department with a multitude of complaints and ailments. Some of these will require the patient to remain fasting, to abstain from eating and drinking. This may have been a factor in why patients did not receive a drink, when requested.  \r\n3. I am sorry to hear that your child did not not receive adequate pain relief while in the department. This is unacceptable and for that I apologise. I do not have access to the medical notes, and I cannot confirm whether or not your child had pre hospital medication. Calpol has a dosing regime of every 4 to 6 hours, and this may have been a factor in the delay.  \r\nI am sorry that you were placed in a corridor with adults. Unfortunately, we work with the resources available to us, however, we try to accommodate children and their parents as best we can. Sometimes at high demand periods this is not always possible to achieve.  \r\nWe do have a referral pathway for paediatrics to the ward in place, agreed with both departments. A recent complaint on this platform identified a failure, and an action plan was identified and put in place. With a large number of staff working within the department, it can take time to filter through to all concerned. I am sorry that we have failed you and your child on this occasion, and for that I do apologise.  \r\nFinally, I hope that you and your child are well, and your little one has made a complete recovery.  \r\nkind regards  \r\njohn kerr","dateOfSubmission":"2022-06-02T08:27:00.037","dateOfPublication":"2022-06-02T13:36:50.95","changeMessage":"No specific claim has been made","source":"co","changeScore":0,"countHelpful":2,"countNotHelpful":0,"links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/944258?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"944258"},{"rel":"responding-to","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/943366?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"943366"}]},{"id":944260,"respondingToOpinionId":943157,"signature":"Jodie Henry, Deputy Sister Male Medical and Coronary Care DHH, Acute, SHSCT","body":"Good morning, thank you for your kind feedback.
