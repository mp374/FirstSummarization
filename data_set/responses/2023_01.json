Also, there are some rarer infections that are not tested for routinely when patients first attend clinic but may be considered if initial tests are clear and symptoms fail to settle. Sometimes infections are not the cause of the symptoms so tests are done and are accurately reported as negative, and the patient needs to be seen elsewhere to get the problem sorted e.g. gynaecology, urology, or dermatology specialists.

This concerned a stroke patient being treated in the John Radcliffe but whose GP is resident in Warwickshire and therefore rehab needs to be provided by Warwickshire. We are now day 28 – no stroke rehab.  \r\nIt was suggested to me that I contact the PALs team to seek some help and raise a complaint.  \r\nI spoke to the one in the John Radcliffe first. Unfortunately, they would be unable to help because although we live in an Oxfordshire post code it is Warwickshire that is responsible for medical services.  \r\nSo off I went to the University Hospital Coventry PALs office and their response was how they would very much like to help if they could but because your partner is not a patient in Warwickshire then we can’t!  \r\nSo we remain in limbo and there is little sign that this impasse will ever end. In the meantime as you can imagine my partner's mental health is deteriorating and who knows what damage is being done to her long term physical well being.","dateOfSubmission":"2023-01-02T11:57:08.017","dateOfPublication":"2023-01-03T12:17:41.497","changeMessage":null,"source":"co","changeScore":null,"countHelpful":0,"countNotHelpful":0,"links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1013331?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1013331"},{"rel":"responding-to","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1012937?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1012937"}]},{"id":1013503,"respondingToOpinionId":1013210,"signature":"Louise Currie, Professional Nursing Development Facilitator/Nurse Manager Support, OPPC, SHSCT","body":"Dear Niamhh1  \r\nMy name is Louise and I am the Professional Nursing Development Facilitator and Nurse Manager Support in Non Acute Hospitals.  \r\nThank you for taking the time to share your feedback.

We are sorry but it is not safe to \"squeeze\" this into a five minute blood test appointment. We do, whenever possible, try to ensure that patient care is given in as few visits as possible, both for the efficiency of the practice and the convenience of the patient. This is reliant on sufficient time being allocated to undertake procedures safely.

I am sorry you feel like you have not been able to get an appointment so I will use this opportunity to explain the best ways to get one. We are actually one of the practices that offers quite a lot of appointments but you will have seen that nationally the NHS is under a lot pressure.\nAppointments can be booked everyday from 8am. They can be booked either by online directly using the NHS app, by telephone, or by attending one of the surgery sites to book in person. You can also send us an Econsult, which will allow us to assess your problem and offer you an appointment directly. We usually respond to Econsults within one to two working days. Econsults are really good as they provide you with a lot of advice that might even resolve your problem without seeing a doctor.\nPrescriptions can be requested also through the NHS app or by calling our medication line on 01322628290. This line is open Monday to Friday 8.30-1pm.\nIf you call the GP for help and you are advised to attend A+E, this is likely because we are concerned you need more urgent help than we can provide.\nWe have recently recruited more reception staff to help with answering the phones so hopefully, that should improve shortly.\nWe hope this explains things in such a way that will enable you to access our services with greater ease.\nThank you once again for your review.\nDr Wole Olarinmoye, GP Principal","dateOfSubmission":"2023-01-03T13:56:02","dateOfPublication":"2023-01-03T15:59:22","changeMessage":null,"source":"nhsc","changeScore":null,"countHelpful":0,"countNotHelpful":0,"links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1013811?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1013811"},{"rel":"responding-to","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1013535?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1013535"}]},{"id":1013744,"respondingToOpinionId":944386,"signature":"Royal Surrey County Hospital","body":"Dear Joseph,\nThank you for taking the time to send us your positive feedback.
