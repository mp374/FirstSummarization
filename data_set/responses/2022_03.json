I am very sorry to learn of your earache which sounds extremely painful and debilitating. From reading what you have written, you clearly know your own body well and knew what was required to manage and improve your symptoms.  \r\nFirstly, I am sorry for the wait time to get through to NHS 24. The demand on our service can fluctuate and, there are times unfortunately, when the call volumes increase which means that some calls take longer than we would like for their call to be answered. We absolutely understand that waiting an extended time is not a good experience, especially in your case, when you were in so much pain and discomfort.  \r\nFrom what you have shared, we recognised that you needed further assessment and passed your details to the local Out of Hours Team with a request that they contact you within a four hour timeframe. I see NHS Forth Valley have been tagged to your story to enable them to see and respond to the Out of Hours management of your care.  \r\nI sense your frustration at being asked the same questions by NHS 24, however as your first call to our service had been managed, we do review any further contact to ensure we capture any change or worsening symptoms a patient may be displaying. I am keen to explore your contact with our service in more detail, especially the management of your 2nd call. Given your health status, it would also be good for us to explore whether your NHS 24 electronic call record has a Key Information Summary (KIS) attached. The detail held on a KIS can alert NHS 24 clinical staff to a patient’s health status or any preferred actions their GP may consider helpful in the event of contact with NHS 24. Therefore, can I ask you to be kind enough to contact me directly on 07814 299944 or by email at [Patient.Experience@nhs24.scot.nhs.uk](mailto:Patient.Experience@nhs24.scot.nhs.uk)  \r\nThanks again for sharing your experience.

Practice","body":"Thank you for your response, we are saddened to hear this as this is simply not true.  We do value patient feedback and would encourage patients to speak to us in the first instance. As a practice, we continued to be responsive to our patient's needs throughout the pandemic and indeed are seeing some 40% more patients than our pre-pandemic levels.   We monitor daily the number of telephone calls we receive, as a service, including the number that we don't manage to answer and have employed additional staff to answer these calls as a result.  We have continued to see patients face to face throughout the pandemic as part of a triage first strategy in line with national guidance, as did many practices.  This was not for our convenience or indeed neither was it because we did not want to see our patients, instead, this was to minimise the patients within the practice to safeguard those who were more vulnerable and also manage and prioritise demand.  During 2021 we employed 3 additional clinical staff members, by way of Advanced Clinical Practitioners, to help us to respond to the increased need and help us manage and respond to the growing increase and need for additional face-to-face appointments. We increased this on a weekly basis whilst monitoring this demand and systematically increasing it accordingly.  In October 2021 we extended our service and relaunched our appointment system thus establishing both an acute (same day) and Routine (pre-bookable) service. This Routine service allowed patients to book both telephone AND face to face appointments directly without the need for initial triage and has been well received by patients as responsive to their needs.  Please be assured that as a Practice Riverside Medical Practice has always maintained a patient-first approach to the way we deliver our service and indeed ensured safe delivery of services at all times for both our patients and our staff.

It is good to hear about how well the nurses and doctors have treated you but would like to apologise for the difficulties you have in accessing our service. Your points are really well made and comments like these are really valuable in understanding how we can improve our service. I am going to respond to each of your points below:  \r\n1. We are in the process of developing online booking that our patients can access. This make take 6-12 months to be fully effective but I agree completely that this will significantly improve service access and in particular improve the telephone service that we currently provide.  \r\n2. We have immediate plans to upgrade our telephone system and we hope that this will be fully operational by early May at the latest. This will include patients knowing where they are in the queue and/or how long the predicted wait could be. This feedback is unfortunately something that many of our patients have commented on and we are committed to making changes as soon as possible.  \r\n3. Once online booking is available, you will be able to choose an appointment time. In the meantime, we are looking at ways of giving our patients more choice and definitely improving the telephone consultation service we provide.  \r\n4. As with point 3, we understand that some of our patients, especially those who work and/or have a family, require more flexibility and choice with appointments. I will take your comments on board to look at ways of improving this in the future.  \r\n5. We are unable to facilitate repeat prescriptions because our clinical team are required to check the medical history of all our patients before any further medication is issued. However, we are developing an electronic prescribing system whereby a prescription can be automatically sent to a patient's nearest pharmacy on the same day, thereby improving the access to repeat medication. The anticipated timeframe for this is within the next 6-12 months.  \r\n6. We have no plans at present to re-introduce the walk in clinics. Following the covid pandemic, we are still required to followed NHS national guidance on maintaining social distancing in clinic settings, which we are not able to achieve in a walk in clinic. I appreciate the walk in clinics had benefits as well as drawbacks when waiting times were high. There is a very high demand for our services and this can be difficult to manage at times. Many of our patients have commented on how they prefer the telephone consultation over the walk in clinics but I understand the walk in clinics did give some of our patients the flexibility of service they needed. Should social distancing recommendations in clinical settings be removed in the future, we will consider reintroducing walk in clinics.  \r\n7. As with the points I have commented on above, there are clearly improvements we can make to how our telephone consultations are run and I will take your comments back to the team. We are operating in a similar way to many other clinical services and due to the high demand for the service looking at ways to ensure our patients can access our service as flexibly as possible.  \r\nI hope I have answered your comments reasonably satisfactorily, but would be more than willing to discuss this with you further if you would like to get in touch with me.  \r\nKind regards.  \r\nJulia Barraclough, Service Manager - juliac.barraclough@mpft.nhs.uk","dateOfSubmission":"2022-03-02T12:28:00.057","dateOfPublication":"2022-03-02T13:47:19.243","changeMessage":"We are preparing to make a change","source":"co","changeScore":4,"countHelpful":0,"countNotHelpful":0,"links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/920672?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"920672"},{"rel":"responding-to","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/918576?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"918576"}]},{"id":920690,"respondingToOpinionId":918897,"signature":"Julia Barraclough, Service Manager, North Staffordshire & Stoke on Trent Sexual Health & HIV Service, MPFT","body":"Thank you for taking the time to provide feedback on the service you received.
