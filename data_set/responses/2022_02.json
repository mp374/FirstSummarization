This is affecting patient throughput in dental practices and due to this they are having to prioritise their own registered patients. Until Scottish Government feel it is safe to ease these restrictions there is likely to be very little change and the practices will still need to work through a backlog of care.  \r\nUnlike medical practice registration patients do not have to be registered with a dental practice in their own Health Board. At this current time very, few dental practices in Scotland are taking on new patients, registration is challenging. At the Dental Helpline we are advising any registered patients to remain registered with practices where the distance is deemed reasonable as it is their best chance at accessing regular dental care.  \r\nA registered practice will be able to deliver any potential follow up care as well as emergency care. The dental service delivered through the helpline is for emergency care only and patients are required to travel to appointments in clinics which are spread across Forth Valley. Your own registered dentist will know your mouth and needs best as they can access your clinical dental notes, these do not follow you like medical notes.  \r\nWith all this in mind we are advising patients to stay registered where they can in the shorter term as it is in their best interests to do so. Meanwhile, Scottish Government and the Health Board are working to look at what they can do to improve access to care.  \r\nLesley Yeaman  \r\nClinical Director, Public Dental Service  \r\nNHS Forth Valley","dateOfSubmission":"2022-02-01T09:27:00.033","dateOfPublication":"2022-02-01T09:27:01.71","changeMessage":"No specific claim has been made","source":"co","changeScore":0,"countHelpful":0,"countNotHelpful":0,"links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/913096?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"913096"},{"rel":"responding-to","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/911248?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"911248"}]},{"id":913097,"respondingToOpinionId":912641,"signature":"Senior Nurse, Cambuslang/Rutherglen/ OOH, NHS Lanarkshire","body":"lacertaqg87  \r\nI would like to thank you for taking the time to share your story within care opinion.

I am sorry that you have experienced difficulties with our telephone system and collecting your prescription.\nWe have recently moved to a new telephone system which we hope will help us to meet the very high patient demand that we and all Practices are currently experiencing.  We appreciate how frustrating it is to have to wait on the phone line.  We have set up more staff to answer the phones and we also now have a call back option so that if you do not wish to wait on the phone you can ask that we call you back when you get to the front of the incoming call queue.  Patients have feedback to us that they are finding this facility helpful.\nRegarding the difficulties picking up your prescription.  The pick up point for prescriptions and medication is currently the window at the side of the building.  I am sorry that you were not admitted inside the building when you came to discuss your husband's prescription. The Dispensary counter inside the building is currently not being used and all dealings with the Dispensary are via the side window.  \nI am sorry that you were given the impression that we are not allowing patients to walk into the surgery.  We adopted a closed door to keep staff and patients safe during the peak of the pandemic with a buzzer entry system but we have not used this for some time now and the front door has been open to all patients to walk in.  We did re-instigate the buzzer system for a very short period in December when the Omicron variant was at its peak so I think that this may have been when you visited. \nIf you would like to discuss anything from your feedback I would be happy to talk to you and we value your comments and ideas for any improvements.\n\nBest wishes\nJackie Evans\nPractice Manager","dateOfSubmission":"2022-02-01T08:44:42","dateOfPublication":"2022-02-01T13:53:23","changeMessage":null,"source":"nhsc","changeScore":null,"countHelpful":0,"countNotHelpful":0,"links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/913365?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"913365"},{"rel":"responding-to","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/905956?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"905956"}]},{"id":913672,"respondingToOpinionId":912161,"signature":"Spamedica (Birkenhead)","body":"Hi Valerie, thank you for your review of SpaMedica Wirral.\nComments like yours really means so much to our teams.

Below is the message on our web site, which explains what has happened and what we are doing about it:\n\nTelephones\n\nIn the past few months the number of calls we have been receiving has increased, resulting in all our lines becoming busy (previously we always had some capacity). We became aware that, dependant on the network you are calling from,  patients are either being informed they have dialled a wrong number or the number is unobtainable. Unfortunately there was no quick fix to this, so the decision we have reached is to replace our telephone system in its entirety with effect from 16th February 2022.\n\nIn the meantime please do continue to try as our lines are working.\n\nI trust the forgoing answers your query and thanks again for contacting us.\n\nKind regards\nPaul Butterworth\nPractice Manager","dateOfSubmission":"2022-02-01T16:33:14","dateOfPublication":"2022-02-01T20:15:57","changeMessage":null,"source":"nhsc","changeScore":null,"countHelpful":0,"countNotHelpful":0,"links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/913339?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"913339"},{"rel":"responding-to","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/913201?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"913201"}]},{"id":913338,"respondingToOpinionId":912145,"signature":"Elm House Surgery","body":"Thank you ever so much for taking the time to leave us this valuable feedback.
