We are sorry to hear that your recent experience was not up to your expected standard.  The reception staff advised me that you were appropriately directed to complete e-consultation as they do with all other patients. We believe systems for accessing care need to be transparent, perceptibly fair and appropriate to the needs of all patient groups for this reason we have adopted total digital triage model where patients are requested to complete e-consultation instead of calling at 8am in the morning rush, spend a lot of time seeking an appointment, and sometimes if they get through only to be told ring for 8am appointment tomorrow morning as they are none left. In this type of appointment system some patients miss out because there are so many people calling at the same time. \nFor cystitis cases, NHS advice can be found on this link https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/cystitis/ \n\nI can confirm that you were contacted within given time frame after you completed e-consultation. You were given a same day appointment at our GP Enhanced service, which is extension to our service and they can see your notes and prescribe like any other GP at Penrhyn Surgery and ask you to collect your prescription from pharmacy as we would normally do at Penrhyn Surgery. \n\nWe are working with Waltham Forest Federation to get urgent patients seen and your appointment was booked same day in the evening at this Service. This appointment was a telephone appointment and not a face to face appointment to save you time and eliminate some of the most stressful parts of visiting the doctor but if a doctor issues prescription then it is patient responsibility to arrange to pick this up from pharmacy. We are unable to arrange transport for these purposes or provide prescription due to the fact that patient prefer to pick prescription up from their practice as this is responsibility of consulting doctor and waste of NHS resources if same thing is done twice.   When you called us again the receptionist took your query to the On-call doctor to make sure you are receiving right appointment she also offered to check with 111 if an earlier appointment can be arranged but 111 again booked you for 4pm in afternoon with the same service. The NHS is currently experiencing some of the most severe pressures in its 70-year history. That’s why all GPs in North East London are working differently now. Please see attached poster from our CCG  https://northeastlondonccg.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/NHS-GP-access-A3-poster-FINAL.pdf \nWe are working at our best trying to accommodate all patients, respond to all queries and book appointments for all patients according to their clinical need and we appreciate the support and understanding from our patients and their feedback whilst we face new challenges and more demand on services. \nWishing you good health \nMany Thanks\nManagement Team at Penrhyn Surgery \n","dateOfSubmission":"2021-12-31T00:17:28","dateOfPublication":"2022-01-01T09:29:31","changeMessage":null,"source":"nhsc","changeScore":null,"countHelpful":0,"countNotHelpful":0,"links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/906265?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"906265"},{"rel":"responding-to","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/905947?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"905947"}]},{"id":906264,"respondingToOpinionId":900148,"signature":"Cheadle Medical Practice","body":"I'm sorry to hear that you've had problems getting an appointment.

I have spoken with the ultrasound manager and am assured that usually the scan appointments run to good time. Sometimes, if women are seen by the specialist fetal medicine team then there can be delays as the scans may be more complex. Unfortunately, we are unable to permit children attending the scan department due to the focus required by the sonographer while performing the scan, very detailed measurements are taken and full attention is required. Also at the moment social distancing is another challenge for the team, as the clinical rooms are very small in the scan department. \nWe do however always expect our staff to be friendly and approachable, therefore we would encourage you to contact our PALS department on 0118 322 8338 or email PALS@royalberkshire.nhc.uk so we can properly review the care provided.

However, this year for various reasons that have come about from the Covid pandemic we have seen even further increase in demand. Our priority is always to ensure the phone lines are fully staffed and relocate staff away from other admin duties if necessary to fulfil this.\n\nWe encourage patients to contact us by phone in order to reduce the Covid transmission risk and maintain social distancing. However, we understand this method is not suitable for all patients, so we also have a member of staff on duty in the reception area to deal with any such face-to-face queries.\n\nPatients can also access an online tool called eConsult via the practice website. eConsult offers around the clock NHS self-help information, signposting to services, and a symptom checker.\neConsult also offers the facility to access non urgent advice from a practice GP or other Healthcare Professional without the need to call the practice. This can be obtained by completing an online form.\n\nWe are sorry that you were frustrated in not getting through to the practice on 27th and 28th December but as these were Bank Holidays the practice was closed. Our telecom supplier automatically sets our phone system to play our closed message on Bank Holidays. On investigation we note this setting was is place so we are unsure why the correct message was not relayed on this occasion. We will submit a report to the supplier for further investigation. \n","dateOfSubmission":"2022-01-04T12:06:48","dateOfPublication":"2022-01-04T22:03:25","changeMessage":null,"source":"nhsc","changeScore":null,"countHelpful":0,"countNotHelpful":0,"links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/906655?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"906655"},{"rel":"responding-to","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/905699?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"905699"}]},{"id":906654,"respondingToOpinionId":906207,"signature":"Lodge Surgery","body":"Dear Anonymous,\n\nThank you for your kind comments regarding your recent experience at the practice.
