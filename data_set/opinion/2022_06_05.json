I was checked on several times during the procedure by Monika to check I was doing ok.

Malachi chatted to me on the phone that day for a out 20 mins and he listened as I told him about my current health problems and how I had no idea how to fix them. He listened mostly and assured me that these were things he could help me with if I wanted to change.  \r\nHe signed me up to an Internet program were I attended a class with other people just like me. The class was brilliant he made it interesting he had a great sense of humour but was also extremely empathetic to each and everyone one of us,never judged never chastised but always on hand to give support and advice. I really enjoyed the group and found it so informative.

When I look back it gets me upset that I put up such a fight with my family to not go and I am so thankful that I listened to them as they outcome has greatly benefited me in the long run.  \r\nThe nursing staff on this ward are truly lifesavers, and they don’t gain the recognition they deserve. All of them are a brilliant team and amazing at what they do. This ward is like a second family to me, I have gotten close with all staff from the cleaners to the doctors we all get along and know each other it’s like a small community. I had to work closely with the physio Sarah for some of my treatment and while they push you to strive for higher goals, they know each patients limitations and it helps so get to where we want to be.  \r\nA lot of people have this stereotype of Bluestone including myself at one point but I would like for people to walk in my shoes and see what I have seen in the way how hard staff work with patients and how they run the ward as they have managed it so professionally but yet have that soft side to them which helps us patients feel open to talk to them.  \r\nI must thank them all from the bottom of my heart.  \r\nThank you.

The staff are easy to get on with, as now I feel I can go over and talk about anything I have on my mind. When I first came in I never would open up with staff as I felt embarrassed to talk about my feelings but now I do it almost every day and that’s why I find it crazy to look back and think what I was like but without the staff helping and treating me I still would be like this. It’s the small improvements like this I have noticed while being here that has helped me. What I most like about here (Sliverwood Unit) is we do lot of activities for example my favourite activity would be playing cards and this is because I can beat everyone at it lol!  \r\nSince being here I have really gotten into doing more physically activities. I love to go outside when it’s a lovely day as the gardens are very nice and walk around it, there is seating outside aswell which is nice and I am putting it to use.  \r\nStaff have went above and beyond to make sure that I understood everything about my care and treatment. I have found staff to be approachable and made me feel at ease.  \r\nI know I still have to continue this journey but I am looking forward to getting out but all I can say is a heartfelt thank you to all the staff!!!","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-06-04T12:55:12.49","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-06-05T10:07:44.47","readBy":[{"name":"Southern Health and Social Care Trust","count":4}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/944545?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"944545"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/944545/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"944545"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/944545/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"944545"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/944545/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"944545"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_32024-bluestone?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"ZT003_32024-bluestone","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/above%20and%20beyond?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"above and beyond"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/walk?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"walk"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/seating%20area?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"seating area"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/outside%20gardens?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"outside gardens"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/944783?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"944783"}]},{"id":944427,"author":"Katee95","authorRoleId":8,"authorRole":"a staff member posting for a patient/service user","title":"Brilliant paediatric care","body":"My son arrived into hospital last night following a severe shortness of breath.

I arrived in October time I think, doctor looked at my lump and went - “I’ll do a MRI and have this out easily in a week”.\n\nMRI goes ahead, I get a phone call “you’ll have to wait 16 weeks for surgery”.\n\nMe: “ok but you said a week?”\n\nWaited about twenty weeks and sent numerous *unanswered* emails to chase.\n\nLo and behold I get my surgery,  they booked the wrong anaesthetic, they booked local and I’d already eaten and it was meant to be a general. I had to wait in the hospital three hours for my stomach to be empty.\n\nBefore the surgery the surgeon is telling me how he’s dealt with Qatari royalty and Saudi royalty and had over 3,000 operations and how lucky I am to have him.\n\nI awake post-surgery. Lump is still there. They say “oh you need a limb specialist, it’s too entangled in muscle and nerves”. Yeah, well the MRI could have told you that and sixteen week wait probably caused that sort of rapid growth (referred it to my GP a year ago).\n\nThen I’m told “don’t worry I’ll make some calls and get this sorted, I don’t want you having to make the referral again through your GP”.\n\nI wait 8 days for the calls to be made and then I’m told “no sorry you have to refer this back to your GP”.\n\nOk, once again conflicting information.\n\nEverybody at this hospital just talks. Talks a big game.\nThey looked  at my lump, says they can remove it easy peasy, says how they dealt with Middle Eastern royalty and how amazing a surgeon they are and not one person has effectively dealt with the issue. I was sliced into and put on anaesthetic and the issue remains. It’s embarrassing.\n\nThat’s the medical side of things. The administration is abhorrent. Appointments booked without my consent, voicemails left on somebody else’s phone about my PRIVATE medical condition, emails unanswered, wrong dates booked, wrong anaesthetic booked, appointments delayed, cancelled, moved around.\n\nYour hospital is a shambles. It’s a shambles. I’m glad I’m NHS because I would never ever ever pay privately for the shoddy service.\n\nWhat winds me up most is the big game that was talked “I’ll remove this in a week” “I did royalty surgery” “I’ll get you a limb specialist” “I won’t refer you back to your GP” “this surgery should be easy”.\n\nEvery thing you said was not carried out, literally every single thing you said was not done.\n\nImagine waking up from an anaesthetic and seeing the lump still there after some surgeon was just telling you how EASY this operation should be for them.\n\nEmbarrassing…","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-06-02T14:18:56","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-06-05T12:00:34","readBy":[{"name":"BMI Healthcare Ltd","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/944607?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"944607"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/944607/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"944607"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/944607/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"944607"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/944607/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"944607"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/nt422?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"NT422","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anaesthetic?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Anaesthetic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/glad?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"glad"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/growth?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"growth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/looked%20after?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"looked after"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lucky?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"lucky"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lump?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"lump"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mri?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"MRI"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/operation?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"operation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stomach?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"stomach"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20lucky?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"very lucky"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doing%20well?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"doing well"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"put off"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20looked%20after?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"not looked after"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/946472?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"946472"}]},{"id":944610,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Appalling service","body":"I couldn’t get my blood taken at the doctors because they couldn’t get the vein.

At this time I was very depressed as I had spilt from after my partner and wasn’t able to see my children due to my lifestyle of binging on drink and drugs as there would be days were I would go drinking and not coming back for 4 days at a time. I lost my job due to me going on these binge cycles and not showing up to work so having no job led to me money worries so a lot of the stress as well having no motive in life led me down a dark path which I honestly thought there was no way out of it which is why I thought suicide was the best option to end the pain. After having all these thoughts I decided to reach out for help, I contacted a local men’s mental health charity were I was able to talk to them about my situation as I really wanted help but felt I had no one to go to. They were able to calm me and reassure me. They helped me so much to get in here and offered me advice and support. Once coming in here it was very scary as I didn’t know what I was getting myself into but looking back it makes me proud on how far I have come and I would not be here if it wasn’t for the support of this service they have helped me in so many ways and I am so grateful for it!  \r\nThe staff have been helping me to try a stay off the drink and drugs currently. I have been sober for 5 Months now which is a big accomplishment and never thought I could do it. This is the longest I've not drank for at least 7 years they are also helping me strategies plans to divert my mind set on positives things to do, so I don't fall back in the hole I was in.  \r\nWhat’s great about this unit is that we do so many activities I usually try and be more active which would usually be going to the gym or going on a daily walk as this helps clear my mind. I get along with all the staff they are all friendly and will chat away and listen to you. There has been times were the ward has been loud but not all the time and I know this can’t be helped.  \r\nWhat’s brilliant is that I am getting the help I need and all because I took the courage to ask for help and that’s all it takes to save I life which is amazing how the service is able to do this!","criticality":"minimally critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-06-04T12:03:36.6033333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-06-05T13:47:02.477","readBy":[{"name":"Southern Health and Social Care Trust","count":7}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/944516?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"944516"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/944516/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"944516"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/944516/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"944516"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/944516/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"944516"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003-cah-bronte-ward?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"zt003-cah-bronte-ward","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/activities?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"activities"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/advice?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"advice"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/drinking?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"drinking"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/listening?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"listening"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/noise%20levels?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Noise Levels"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/safe?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/strategies?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"strategies"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"amazing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/944795?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"944795"}]},{"id":944517,"author":"Aoiyf36","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"They are an absolute credit the NHS.","body":"I have only recently came onto the Bronte Ward and so far everything has been very good. The staff were very kind and welcoming when I first came in. I wasn’t expecting the ward to be as nice as it is, My room is very comfortable and is cleaned daily. The ward its self is kept very clean and there is always a cleaner on ward. I would suffer with anxiety and depression but have been getting treatment from this service. I have been going to Dr Campbell and she has been very helpful with my treatment what I like about her is that she is so patient and understanding. At one point, I was feeling that low I didn't want to live anymore and I told Dr Campbell about these thoughts. It’s nice to have a doctor that I feel comfortable to talk to about these things as I have never felt that I could explain this to my GP. She usually checks up on me regularly that’s when I get to spill all my thoughts to her. I have been getting medication but she explained to me all about the tablets and went into thorough detail about them to make sure I understood what I was getting which I liked as it made me feel involved in my treatment.

Having to deal with this disorder is a very scary thing as I thought that this is what the rest of my life is going to be like from, restricting food and living with constant anxiety. It was a wakeup call for me as I knew this is no way to live your life. Not only was my body slowly being destroyed without proper nutrition my life was too.  \r\nClose family and friends were getting very worried for me. I was due an appointment with my doctor for bloods. My doctor had told me that from my blood tests I was very malnourished. They took more tests they found my heart rate was low and I was not well at all. After a thorough assessment and having to open up to my doctor about my eating disorder, they told me that they thought it would be best to refer me to here, as they said they will offer the treatment that I need. The next week I was brought into here which honestly saved my life. I was given a meal plan as well as amazing support as I faced my fears around food and reenergized my body.  \r\nThis disorder really affected my life and I’m sure there are others’ who are suffering with this as well and promise them that the best thing they can do is come here as it really does help so much. The help I am now receiving is slowly but surely opening my world again and making me realise that life doesn’t have to be what my anxiety allows.  \r\nI know that I still have a long way to go but the support that the staff on this ward have been providing me with is more than I ever could have asked for and is vital for my recovery. They have given me so much and I hope they read this and know that they are amazing at what they do and deserve the world for it. I hope those who are experiencing an eating disorder will reach out.  \r\nThe help I have been receiving is invaluable and I will forever be thankful to the southern trust health and social care services for saving me from the dark place that eating disorders transport you to. I feel so much better after receiving this help and although the anxious thoughts are still there they don’t feel so loud and unbearable.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-06-04T12:10:22.9","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-06-05T14:48:52.563","readBy":[{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2022)","count":1},{"name":"Southern Health and Social Care Trust","count":5},{"name":"Beat","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/944521?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"944521"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/944521/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"944521"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/944521/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"944521"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/944521/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"944521"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003-cah-bronte-ward?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"zt003-cah-bronte-ward","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/assessment?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"assessment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20tests?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"blood tests"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/eating%20disorder?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"eating disorder"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/felt%20safe?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"felt safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/heart%20rate?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"heart rate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/invaluable?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"invaluable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/low?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"low"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/malnourished?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"malnourished"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mood?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"mood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nutrition?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"nutrition"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/recovery?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"recovery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/saved%20my%20life?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"saved my life"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support%20staff?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"support staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thorough?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"thorough"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thoughts?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"thoughts"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"amazing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hope?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Hope"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"supported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mood%20improved?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"mood improved"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/forever%20grateful?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"forever grateful"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/973415?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"973415"}]},{"id":944522,"author":"Aoiyf36","authorRoleId":8,"authorRole":"a staff member posting for a patient/service user","title":"You can tell they put in 100% when treating us","body":"I have been receiving treatment here in the bluestone unit for a while now, I would say for over 5 Months it has been now. I self-admitted myself into bluestone as I knew I needed help, it was an easy process and I was quickly brought in which is very good there was no waiting for this service.  \r\nAs soon as I arrived onto the ward I was instantly welcomed and treated with such kindness from the staff. They honestly couldn’t do anything more for me than what they are doing now, you can tell they put in 100% when treating us. I haven’t come across a staff member who isn’t pleasant, you can get along with them so well which makes it a lot easier for us patients to open up to them and build that bond. I do feel as if I can trust them as I know they are here to help me and only want the best recovery which is comforting to have that support from them. My favourite time of day is when we go on our daily walks, staff usually approach me and ask if I would like to go. I like that they give me a choice on whether or not to go as it gives us that independence on deciding on what to do and also some days I am up for it and other times I have no effort to go. If I don’t go on a walk I usually like to sit out in the gardens and play some basketball or something like that I like to get myself up and out in a bit of fresh air as I feel this helps clear my mind a lot of the time.  \r\nWhen talking about my treatment I do feel involved a lot of the time, the nurses and doctors always tell me what they are going to do and what exactly is happening. Also I feel comfortable to talk to them about any concerns I have on my treatment, I have felt listened to by them and notice that they take my opinion into consideration which is great! I feel like this service has been a great as it has helped me on so many ways and without it I don’t know where I would be. At the moment I am ready to leave but before I leave I have to wait on a care plan and a place in a supported living facility, I have been waiting on this for a while now but I don’t mind having to wait as being in here has been very good.  \r\nThe doctors have been excellent with my treatment. I feel open with them also and they listen to all my concerns and when I first came in I had a lot of query's, however they were all answered thoroughly and in detail. I usually tend to go more to my doctor about certain things as I feel I am in safe hands with them and since I have been going to them for a while now I feel as if we have built a bond. Staff are good in the way they always tell you that they are here if I am in need of anything or they ask how I am and if I am feeling okay. They are very supportive and I do feel that it is easy to get their attention as there is always a member of staff floating about the ward.  \r\nThe cleanliness of the ward is kept at a very high standard as I like to keep my room clean any way but cleaners will still come in and change beds and clean floors etc. The meals have been very good, in my opinion I don’t feel as if there could be anything improved on them I have enjoyed everything on the menu and if there is something I don’t like there is always another option to choose.","criticality":"not

I was fortunate enough that there was someone on hand to help me get off the main road, they told me that I would need to go to hospital as my elbow began to swell up. Since I had no car I had to phone my husband to tell him what happened and ask him to take me to ED.  \r\nThe ED staff were amazing. They said that I might have fractured my elbow and wrist. After a lot of x-rays I was told that it was my right elbow that was fractured. I was told that can be treated in the fracture clinic. I was delighted that it wasn’t as serious as I thought it was going to be. The wait though for the clinic was quite long but it was a very busy day.  \r\nThe staff have been exceptional, very caring people. You can tell they are very good at their job by the way I was treated. All of your team here at CAH have done a brilliant job!","criticality":"minimally critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-06-04T12:44:43.9933333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-06-05T15:18:54.897","readBy":[{"name":"Southern Health and Social Care Trust","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/944539?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"944539"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/944539/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"944539"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/944539/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"944539"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/944539/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"944539"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_32024_180?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"ZT003_32024_180","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing%20staff?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"amazing staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/caring?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"caring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ed?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"ED"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/elbow?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"elbow"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/face?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"face"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fracture?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"fracture"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hand?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"hand"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/road%20accident?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"road accident"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wrist?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"wrist"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/x-rays?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"x-rays"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/relieved?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"relieved"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/long%20wait%20in%20a&e?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"long wait in a&e"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/949256?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"949256"}]},{"id":944529,"author":"Aoiyf36","authorRoleId":8,"authorRole":"a staff member posting for a patient/service user","title":"It really has been beneficial to me coming here","body":"I have only arrived on to the Cloughmore ward about 2 weeks ago and even though I have only been here a short period I have to say it has been very good and I haven’t seen anything to complain about. I was admitted on this ward by a referral and it turns out to be working very well for me. The staff on the ward has been just amazing, 11/10 from me with their work. I feel as if they have been treating me like a family member they’re that caring. They go out of their way to help you which even though this job can be difficult, they make it look so easy they’re just that good.  \r\nI have been referred in here as I would suffer from mental health problems and would self-harm as well. It was very scary for me to come into this new environment as I don’t really like to change things, so at the start it was a big struggle to come here, but now that I am here I feel very comfortable. Staff have been very patient and caring towards me and have been helping me take small steps in my recovery and I am happy to have them here supporting me as it helps a lot.  \r\nI know I have only been in here a short time and I know it will take me a while before I fully recover but I can see the improvement in mental health from being here. The ward itself is peaceful and I said before it very comfortable and have access to a lot of things. We tend to do different activities everyday but my favourite would be painting as it helps take my mind of things and put me at ease. It really has been beneficial to me coming here and I would advised anyone who is admitted in coming here just do it, the scariest part is the admission because I didn’t know what was going to happen but now everything has been great, from the treatment to the staff even the rooms are very nice!","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-06-04T12:20:11.7766667","progress":"Story has a

Now that I am back I am in here (Cloughmore) and it has been great. I get along with everyone including the other patients.  \r\nThe process into self-admission is very good as it easy to do and there wasn’t a long wait for me which was great. Staff on the ward are very good they are very hardworking and approachable people. Anytime I would like a cup of tea I just have to ask the once and they get it, so I would find it easy to get their attention and there are plenty of staff on this ward.  \r\nThe staffs treatment is also brilliant I feel very cared for and well looked after by them. I feel supported and also comfortable to talk to them. We have a lot of independence while being in here as we can make our own choices on whether or not we want to do something and we get the opportunity to participate in a lot of things for example I tend to go to the gym 3 times a week but they always ask if I would like to go which is great. I always used to go to the gym before coming in here so it’s brilliant that I am still able to keep up this routine of going and it also me to release a lot of pressure when going there.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-06-04T12:24:12.7833333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-06-05T15:40:51.087","readBy":[{"name":"Southern Health

point I had caused severe injuries and the ambulance had to be called. When I arrived I came in though ED I was seen around 2 hours after being admitted to the hospital by one of the doctors. I was in a very bad place mentally and was waiting alone in ED. I hadn’t eaten in a very long time however staff members offered me food while waiting. One thing that I remember while being in there was that I was very thirsty and they’re was no water in the waiting area it stayed that way for at least the duration of my stay in the waiting area so it would be helpful if this was improved upon.  \r\nEventually when I got treated for my wound I told the doctors and nurses of how I was struggling very badly with depression. I eventually got admitted into Bluestone Unit. It was night time when I got allocated to my bed in the ward. This was the longest I hadn’t slept in my life so I was very glad to be brought into a room and the bed was very comfortable which helped. I was have a history with drugs and self-harm the consultant made it a safe place to discuss all these thing and she had a kindness to her which made it easier to inform her of all this. The consultant is very good as I felt very comfortable around her and I could speak to her about things that made me uneasy. I feel that she had empathy and compassion for me which was why I felt very comfortable on this ward. I feel very well supported by the HSCNI (Health & Social Care Northern Ireland) as a whole but specifically by the staff here in the Bluestone Unit because they have been helping me so much.  \r\nMy mother suffers from schizophrenia for the duration of my life and my father suffers from depression. I have told the doctors this and that I was struggling for a very long time, they were very understanding of my situation and felt as if they were putting my needs first and looking out for the best for me. I feel that my life has changed drastically in a positive way from coming in here and from speaking with other patients even though we may not agree on most things but what we all agreed on was how great the staff have treated us. Would like to thank all those who have helped me so far with my treatment I have so much respect towards you!","criticality":"minimally

was situated in St Lukes. I had a bad experience in St Lukes when I was there so it made it really hard for me to come here as I thought it I may get the same treatment as I did there but I was so wrong. Times have changed and it’s brilliant to see how much our mental health service has improved and upgraded. Here in Cloughmore it’s a lot more modern and has a comfortable vibe to the ward it doesn’t feel like a hospital setting at all just feels as if you’re at home.  \r\nI have not seen a proper consultant in years and so this year was the first time I have. I have never stopped having my conditions this would include no sleep, scared constantly, always worrying, migraines most of the time daily. Not leaving home unless I need food and feeling sick and dizzy with worry.  \r\nSince coming here I have noticed a changed in myself and how much more confident I have become. Since being with other patients and talking to them daily I feel this has help deal with my social anxiety and the ability to open up and talk about my thoughts to staff. I never thought I would be able to do it, but look at me now giving feedback to staff members I have just met. This is a big step for me but I have been encouraged by staff to do these sorts of things. They always say it’s the small steps that matters and with all these small steps they are making a path to recovery for me. The staff have been by my side throughout my recovery journey and have helped me so much and even they noticed how much I have improved from being in here. Honestly it was a very good decision to come here to receive treatment.  \r\nThe consultant has very supportive and has been a great help to me. Everything has been brilliant with staff helping me cope with my conditions. I was honestly very shocked at the changed in the mental health service, I am so beyond happy at how much effort they are now putting into this service and it honestly has helped me a lot and I cannot thank the people enough who are responsible for this treatment!","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-06-04T12:30:41.7466667","progress":"Story has a

journey for me but I am trying very hard as I have made a goal to myself to complete this and get better.  \r\nThere are days were I do feel really down and I would just like to be by myself but I know deep down that the only way that I can recover is if I do put in 100% effort. As well staff are always encouraging me to do these things as it helps to build up my self-esteem. I have been trying to communicate more with staff and patients lately but I have always found it hard to talk to people and have always like to keep myself to myself, so this is why it has been hard for me adjust to a busy ward with lots of people I do not know.  \r\nThe nurses have been very good in finding ways for me to overcome this barrier, I tend to like communicating with people through activities or interests as it’s easier to talk to them about this. I like that there are other people in the similar age group to me on this ward as this has helped with my social anxiety as I feel I can talk to them. So far the patients that I have talked to have been very nice and it’s comforting to know that we are all in the same situation and getting help for the same reasons, it makes it easier to open up to them about my feelings.  \r\nWhen I do get overwhelmed with certain situations, we have come to the solution of doing my breathing techniques to help me calm down and put me at ease and so far it has been working quite well. Staff introduced this to me and now completed it with me as we usually bring up some breathing technique videos on social media.  \r\nThere are times where the ward can become loud, it can be quite annoying when it happens during the night, this can make me become quite irritated but I know that there’s nothing that the staff can do about this.  \r\nThe cleanliness of the ward has been great there is nothing to be improved on that. I suffer from OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder) so it was a big deal for me when the cleaners would come into my room but they never changed the room they basically changed the bed and ensure that the floor and everything was clean which I was glad as it really makes me uncomfortable when my items start to be moved around. The meals are okay I would just like to see more healthy options for example it would good if salads or fruit bowls were an option.  \r\nI have gotten on very well with all members of staff here in

Last month I needed an urgent operation to remove stones that had become stuck in my ureter. I was hugely impressed with the care and support I received while in the hospital. Surgeons, doctors, anaesthetist, and nurses could not gave been kinder.  \r\nSadly my experience of follow up care has been much less positive. Before I was discharged the surgeon informed me I had a stent temporarily in my ureter and this would need to be removed in 2 weeks time. Since being discharged communication has been non existent. I had an x-ray 2 weeks after surgery but nobody has been in touch to tell me what it showed.  \r\nI have tried phoning the urology outpatients department every day for the past week and they never answer. I eventually phoned the ward I had been on when I had my surgery. They were very helpful but informed me that I was not on any of the lists of people who have a stent. So basically I've been waiting for an appointment nobody knew I needed. Something has clearly gone wrong. I have now had the stent in for 4 weeks instead if the 2 weeks the surgeon recommended. I have tried phoning the surgeons secretary but have been unable to reach them.  \r\nOver the past 2 weeks I've had increasing issues with the stent including discomfort, a sensation like I'm sitting on something, bleeding, and needing to go to the toilet every 30min or so. I feel very frustrated and desperately want to get the stent removed so that I can have support of normal life.","criticality":"moderately

They examined me and said they were going to break my water and I think followed up simply asking me if this was ok. I didn’t know what to say. I was shocked and quietly agreed. Looking back, I have massive regrets about this as this went on to cause a traumatic birth. If I could do it again I would definitely have refused the intervention at this stage and waited to see if my baby came naturally. During active labour they also attached a heartbeat monitor to my baby’s head which the midwife said they thought might be faulty…again this led to further intervention and an episiotomy, which led to post natal complications.  \r\nTo summarise, the staff are lovely but people need to be aware they can refuse medical intervention, even during pregnancy, as many may not

When I arrived at the A&E department there were around 8-10 ambulances outside and I was informed that my grandmother was still waiting in the ambulance to be seen in ED- obviously this was highly concerning as every second is precious during a stroke. However, the 2 ambulance crew members that were looking after her very kindly let myself and my father sit with my grandmother during her time waiting outside, and we were glad to see her symptoms had resolved. I believe it was nearly 2 hours we were sat in the ambulance outside A&E and naturally my grandmother was upset about this. However, I would like to pass on my thanks to the 2 ambulance crew members who were wonderful; they were incredibly kind, compassionate, professional and attentive to my grandmother even getting her a hot drink and some biscuits and offered much reassurance to my grandmother and tried to keep her warm and comfortable. They were also very gracious to myself and my father, and although I recognise it must have been somewhat frustrating for them to be waiting outside A&E, I want them to know that their kindness (and much needed humour) did not go unnoticed; it was greatly appreciated.  \r\nAlthough I understood the requirement to wait outside A&E and appreciate the pressures that the national health service is facing; I was somewhat disappointed by the manner in which my grandmother was treated when inside A&E. I felt the nurse looking after her was quite dismissive towards my grandmother and they continually told her to just be patient as opposed to communicating with her and reassuring her. I appreciate that there likely would have been others in that nurse's care and that naturally the nurse would have been prioritising and as such I explained that to my grandmother. However I feel a few kind words may have gone a long way as at 98 years old my grandmother did not understand what was going on around her.","criticality":"mildly

By the time a doctor did check her at 8pm she was 8cms dilated and needed to be taken immediately to give birth.  \r\nThe birth was uneventful, however we felt the services provided on the maternity unit (ward 73) of the hospital were verging on dangerous (similar to the care received on the day of the birth). There did not seem to be enough staff, therefore not enough time spent with service users.  \r\nDiffering covid practice depending upon which midwife was in charge that day. Lack of knowledge in terms of twins, breast feeding, and related equipment.

As a younger patient with no other limitations and wanting an active lifestyle I am supposed to have the Closed Loop Stimulation function activated which gives a more responsive and physiological heart rate than just a flat 60 which is the minimal default setting it leaves the factory with.  \r\nOn my first clinic visit to get this turned on they were unfamiliar with this function and said they don't normally activate it, which is a ridiculous waste of an expensive device when a much cheaper basic model could be used, rather like having a porsche and just driving it around in first gear.  \r\nAfter this was sorted out with the consultant, I excitedly went back to get it switched on. As is fairly common as these devices often need some initial fine tuning to suit the individual, the first setting tried was a bit too aggressive, amazing during the day but kept me up all night with a too high a heart rate. They could only fit me in as an emergency the following day to disable the CLS, but I was supposed to be given the next available appointment to have it reactivated to a slightly lower setting.

I am still waiting and have been given an appointment for October, as if it is just a routine check up I am waiting for, not a device that is only semi functional.  \r\nI am truly grateful to have a heart rate of 60 rather than the 40 or so I had untreated, but feel so frustrated to be missing out on what this amazing device could do for me if programmed properly.

She is 75 and in a wheelchair. Blood test were taken and we sat in the waiting room were there were around 12 patients waiting. Mum is diabetic and in poor health. No-one came in to speak to us to update us while we were waiting.  \r\nPatients are meant to be under the care of a nurse while there. The nurse kept walking up and down the corridor looking lost with a scrap piece of paper in their hand and observing others on the nurse station. They did not seem to know what they were meant to be doing and walked around the waiting room asking peoples names rather than calling the name of the patient they wanted to speak to.  \r\nAfter a couple of hours I asked if the blood test results were back, and they were and I was told mum was the 4th patient on a list. It was another 4 hours before she was seen, so it appears that it took the doctor 4 hours to see the 3 patients before us. We were there for a total of 10 hours. It's just not acceptable. It seems like they expect you to just wait all day being ignored with no communication or care whatsoever.","criticality":"mildly

After some hours of tests and discussions among the doctors I was admitted to the CCU for further investigations, which was something I had not been expecting.  In the CCU was given an extensive series of tests and scans, I could see that they were conducting a very thorough investigation.  My care was exemplary, all the staff, nurses and doctors were helpful, caring and professional, explaining to me what was happening at every stage which was most reassuring.  Eventually I was discharged when they were satisfied I was safe to go.  I was prescribed some new medicines and they booked me for a further scan in a few months time as part of the follow-up plan.  I would recommend anyone with chest pains who thinks they might have problems not to hesitate but to go and see this excellent team straight away.  They are highly professional and you will definitely be in safe hands.  I had full confidence in the expertise of the doctors I saw and the experience and training of the nurses.

But don’t worry it’s ok. We have had a 2nd urgent emergency referral request sent from  \r\nGPs response was he has an appointment late June. Oh well that’s ok then he can have more antibiotics and painkillers. Still no further forward with his care. It’s neglect and causing my son scarring in his ears and more than likely further health complications and long term health problems.  \r\nI feel awful for any parent going through the same. Lack of care for a child’s holistic development absolutely negligent care. Might I add we have been to A and E who are doing another letter which will fall on the generic response waiting list. I will not be contacting the patient experience team.
