That aside the attitude was awful - why be front facing if you don’t like communicating with people.  When people attend A&E it’s because they need help and are feeling vulnerable - please ensure reception staff have the right skill set to be front facing.  If they don’t have people skills  (colleagues can surely hear the tone and attitude used) maybe they should have back office duties only.  The receptionist job is to sit there greet people and book them in so I fail to see the reason this receptionist was so unpleasant and so rude.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-02-05T07:29:27","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-02-05T15:50:34","readBy":[{"name":"University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/914368?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"914368"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/914368/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"914368"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/914368/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"914368"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/914368/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"914368"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rrk97?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"RRK97","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hearing?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"hearing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vulnerable?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"vulnerable"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/918328?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"918328"}]},{"id":914370,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"So disappointed ","body":"After months of trying to see my GP and endless phone calls, to be given a appointment with a GP l have not seen, l cannot fault the GP he was very thorough.

I have recently moved just out of area and the difference between Upper Gordon Road Surgery and my new surgery is immense. I am now able to see a GP, sometimes the same day, treatment and referrals are very prompt, results come back\nwithin a few days and the service given is exceptional. If some GP surgeries can give this service why not all?","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-02-05T09:19:26","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-02-05T16:47:58","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/914375?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"914375"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/914375/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"914375"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/914375/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"914375"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/914375/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"914375"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/h81075?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"H81075","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"blood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20test?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"blood test"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/face?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"face"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/test?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"test"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/triage?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"triage"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/922998?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"922998"}]},{"id":914376,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Time to close!

During consultation I was told I could have emailed my concerns! After being at this surgery for many years and having exceptional care from some of the old GP’s who have either retired or left the practice. It is no longer fit for purpose. You are locked out of the surgery and can only come in If you have an appointment. So in theory any queries have to be phoned in and you are in a queue for on occasions over an hour plus! You can only have a face to face according the the receptionist if the GP deems it necessary post a telephone consultation. I have no idea what this service is that they are offering armed with rude GPs and a limited number of receptionist that know what they are doing I would not recommend anyone joining this practise and fear there will be big catastrophe with patients health if there is no intervention with how this service is being run! I have so many experiences of awful care/service from them. Where they don’t do what they say they will do. Putting patient health at risk. Not appropriate to list here. But sufficient to drive me to write this after years of being with this surgery. They do not listen to hear!

Twenty minutes later, I got a call from the nurse practitioner, who was straight-to-the-point but friendly, and he explained that he would send off a prescription for me to pick up at the pharmacy about 30 minutes later.

When I attended the GP did not know anything about it and seemed not to know what was expected. I said I had queries and was told I had better get on with them as time was short. Nothing appeared to fall within the GP’s remit e.g. referrals for physio, memory loss. Much of the advice given was common sense. A review was carried out but only because I pushed. At the end of the appointment I said I was disappointed. After a lack of face to face appointments for some time due to covid and the fact it was supposed to be a medical review appointment I had expected more. At the end of the appointment the door was shut in my face when I was still speaking. I would not recommend this practice despite the fact that the receptionists are very sweet.
