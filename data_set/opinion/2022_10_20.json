When I got there I found the clinic had moved to clinic 1, I had not been previously told that the department had moved and was not provided with a map showing me where the new clinic was placed.  \r\nOn finding the clinic, I took a seat and waited for my appointment to proceed. When I got to see the consultant , he did not know anything about me and what medication I had been prescribed for my condition, he asked me all types of questions to ascertain how I was feeling and to what level this awful disease has taken me.  \r\nI left the clinic feeling very unsure and dismayed. I will now have phone calls every six months instead of going 48 miles to the hospital. I told the consultant I had been prescribed HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE over the phone, had regular checks, and an eye test as prescribed.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-10-18T10:40:19.69","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-10-20T07:45:43.56","readBy":[{"name":"United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust","count":6},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2022)","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/986873?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"986873"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/986873/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"986873"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/986873/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"986873"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/986873/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"986873"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rwdda_410?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"RWDDA_410","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/coordination?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"coordination"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dismayed?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"dismayed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/parking?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"parking"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/rheumatology?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"rheumatology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unsure?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"unsure"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/989145?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"989145"}]},{"id":986885,"author":"Le Frisp","authorRoleId":4,"authorRole":"a relative","title":"Nursery Court has brought my parents back to life","body":"As my parents entered their mid-to-late 80's , their mobility, cognition and general health deteriorated to such an extent they practically became prisoners in their own home. Their social circle slowly shrank to close family and carers. It became clear that these two formerly fit, active, outgoing people were slowly melting before our eyes.  \r\nMy mum secured a place at Nursery Court pre-pandemic, and we saw an immediate change in her. Overall, her demeanour and mood was lifted.  \r\nSadly the pandemic struck and she started to regress back into her shell.  \r\nThe pandemic and deteriorating health meant dad was suffering from lack of engagement as much as mum was.  \r\nWith a lot of help from South Ayrshire Social Services, a place was secured at Nursery Court for Dad, and both attend at the same time.  \r\nI swear, if Dad could move into Nursery Court he would. He is literally chomping at the bit waiting for his transport to the day centre.  \r\nI will make no apology for the gushing praise I am about to heap on Nursery Court. Every word of it has been hard earned.  \r\nNursery Court has brought my parents back to life, the social interaction with others in a similar position has literally re-lit their fire.  \r\nThe place would be nothing without the staff at the centre, attentive, caring and compassionate don't come close to describing their commitment to their clients.  \r\nTo be honest, clients is the wrong word to use, as it's obvious the staff treat my parents , and their other visitors, as a community, a family if you will. They somehow manage this while remaining uber-professional, which is a hard trick to pull off.  \r\nI'm not equipped with sufficient superlatives to describe the worth this centre brings to the elderly of Lower South Ayrshire.  \r\nThe place has literally been a lifesaver for my parents and the world would be a better place if it had more facilities like Nursery Court.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-10-18T11:03:45.1","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-10-20T07:55:41.573","readBy":[{"name":"South Ayrshire Health and Social Care Partnership","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/986885?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"986885"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/986885/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"986885"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/986885/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"986885"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/986885/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"986885"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/s37000027-ds-nc?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"S37000027-DS-NC","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/day%20care?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Day Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/elderly?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"elderly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/engagement?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"engagement"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mobility?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"mobility"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professional?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"professional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/safe?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/social%20services?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Social Services"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/socialising?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"socialising"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassionate?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"compassionate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happy?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mood%20improved?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"mood improved"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/rejuvenated?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"rejuvenated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pandemic?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"pandemic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/social%20interaction?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"social interaction"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/991125?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"991125"}]},{"id":988127,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Fantastic","body":"I have been with Peel Croft Surgery for many years, I have never had a problem there, in fact you are always made to feel very comfortable and relaxed, even through changes of doctors through the years the practise has always \nmaintained high standards and never faltered.

I’m writing my review after forty years of experience with this practice and hope that what follows is reflective and fair.\nMy wife and I have consistently received a high quality service from this practice. We have seen many GPs and other staff come and go but still maintain excellence and respond seamlessly to new initiatives over time.\nGPs we have seen have always been thorough, totally professional and reassuring, always signposting where necessary. All other staff have been friendly, pleasant, taking extra time to put us at our ease, leading to positive outcomes. Staff are clearly led by an efficient, innovative Practice Manager. An example of this has been the recent COVID-19 vaccination programme - superbly organised and executed. We have always found reception staff to be very pleasant too. They have a difficult job. It is reasonable to ask the reason for an appointment. Given the high demand for appointments, there has to a filtering system. However, when the issue has been personal or private, we have said so and this has been respected by reception staff and we have been given an appointment.\nOnline services for ordering repeat prescriptions, accessing test results and booking appointments are first class and are the envy of many of our friends and family. Booking appointments on the day are also available provided you telephone the surgery as soon as it opens.\nThank you PHMG for the excellent service you provide and have provided over many, many years.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2021-07-27T12:25:02","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-10-20T08:32:28","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/987783?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"987783"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/987783/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"987783"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/987783/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"987783"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/987783/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"987783"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/h82052?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"h82052","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/positive?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"positive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/respected?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"respected"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/test?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"test"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vaccination?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"vaccination"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hope?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Hope"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20ease?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"at ease"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"put off"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/no%20hope?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"no hope"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"covid"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%20vaccination?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"covid vaccination"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%2019?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"covid 19"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20respected?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"not respected"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20at%20ease?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"not at ease"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/988633?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"988633"}]},{"id":987782,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Efficient and friendly","body":"I don’t go often to the doctors but when I do this practice has been amazing.

We left it a couple of hours and decided to call 999 where the call Center stayed on line till the rapid response vehicle arrived about 6 minutes after making the call.

The practice is renowed throughout the area as being one of the best. All the staff from reception to doctors to ancillary services and are great and always with a welcoming smile. Sure they have  been inundated during the pandemic but now have an even larger team of doctors in place and is also a renowned teaching practice.

relative","title":"Beds in corridors","body":"My mother suffers from a degenerative brain condition and currently lives in a residential care home and is completely reliant on others for all aspects of her care. She is cognitively sound but physically she is wheelchair bound, uses machinery to transfer, cannot wash or feed herself and is unable to speak or communicate verbally. She uses pointing and a spell board to point at phrases and commands.  \r\nShe was scheduled for PEG feeding tube insertion due to her being unable to get enough nutrition orally. We were asked to arrive at 14:00 the day before her procedure at Ward 104. My mother was extremely nervous about going into hospital as people who do not know her find it very difficult to understand her way of communicating and she was worried about her procedure.  \r\nWhen we arrived, we were informed that there was no bed for her and directed to the relatives room. We were given no timescale for a bed being ready and waited for 6 hours (with my mother becoming agitated and upset. She was sore from sitting in her wheelchair for 6 hours) before a doctor informed us that they would put her in a bed in the corridor for the night as they couldn't free up a room.  \r\nMy mother was completely against this suggestion, as was I. My mother was expected to lie in a corridor with no privacy or dignity. She would have been hoisted for going to the toilet etc in her nightwear in the middle of a busy corridor, would have had no rest in the bright lights and was already incredibly nervous about her admission. Most importantly in this situation, she would have no access to a call button which would have meant that she would have been unable to summon assistance if she was in pain, needed help to move or needed the toilet as she cannot shout out or help herself.  \r\nFortunately, I was there to speak up and refuse this. If I wasn't there, she wouldn't have been able to communicate her feelings about the situation and they would have put her in the corridor despite it being wholly inappropriate. It was only when I said that I would just take her back to her care home rather than sleep in the corridor that they were all of a sudden able to move a patient to another ward to free up a proper bed space.  \r\nI write this not to complain about waiting for 6 hours (without her being offered a drink, we bought water for her cup) but to complain that it was suggested to leave her for the night in a corridor with no regard to her needs or abilities and no foresight of the risk and distress that that could have caused her.  \r\nI sincerely hope that leaving people in corridors without access to call buttons, without direct supervision, without dignity or comfort is not common practice. I'm just glad I was there to advocate for her.  \r\nI would like to mention that the nursing staff were sympathetic and did agree that it was not appropriate or acceptable but they are being put in this situation due to current pressures. Pressures or not, the patients (and nursing staff) should not have to be put at risk.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-10-18T17:20:13.9166667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-10-20T09:20:01.807","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Grampian","count":8},{"name":"St. Andrews University ScotGEM Medical Students","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/987050?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"987050"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/987050/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"987050"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/987050/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"987050"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/987050/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"987050"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/n101h_301?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"N101H_301","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxious?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"anxious"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stressed?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"stressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/brain?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"brain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/coordination?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"coordination"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nursing%20staff?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"nursing staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nutrition?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"nutrition"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/peg?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"PEG"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting%20time?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"waiting time"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wheelchair?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"wheelchair"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dignity?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Dignity"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/994819?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"994819"}]},{"id":984403,"author":"hadares54","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Losing Confidence in Dr Surgery","body":"My last two (one for me, one for my child) e-consults have gone past the time they said they would get back to me, the last one I had to chase them for it.

They examined and concluded that there was a infection forming because my tooth was impacted and had no space to push through . Gave me antibiotics and explained how to care for it . Luckily after being seen the infection was gone but was suggested for a removal .\n\nI was severely scared about it but staff were super comforting and explained everything through the extraction . Made sure to check up on me as I was shaking . Provided after care information , no medication but in all honesty only needed paracetamol on the first day .\n\nArea is healing well no pain or any issues . Super happy with the service and staff .

When explaining the accident, I felt like everything I said went straight over the top of their head. My concerns were not listened to and I spent less than 5 minutes with this doctor.  \r\nI made the doctor aware that I hit my head during the accident and wasn’t even given a neurological examination to check for concussion or any other head injury.  \r\nI wasn’t asked if I had taken any medication or pain relief following the accident, nor was any advice given to me on what medication to take following the accident.  \r\nThe doctor treated my consultation like a therapy session. They continually complained about lack of staff (due to sickness and people leaving) and how nothing was restocked because of this.  \r\nI am aware the NHS is on its knees and I sympathise with all the stress and pressure all NHS staff are facing, but the distinct lack of care is not on. Mistakes are going to be made and lives potentially lost.  \r\nI have never attended A&E before, and this experience has completely put me off going ever again. If I do ever need to attend A&E again, I hope I see a doctor who actually listens to my concerns and I hope it’s one that gives me a full clinical examination.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-10-18T18:18:57.5066667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-10-20T09:44:56.073","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Borders","count":6},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2022)","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/987054?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"987054"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/987054/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"987054"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/987054/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"987054"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/987054/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"987054"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/b120h_180?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"B120H_180","score":1},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disappointed?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frustrated?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"frustrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/accident?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"accident"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bedside%20manner?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"bedside manner"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/clinical%20care?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Clinical Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/concussion?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"concussion"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/head%20injury?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"head injury"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/injury?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"injury"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/listening?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"listening"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain%20relief?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"pain relief"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/991024?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"991024"}]},{"id":987819,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Good practice","body":"The practice is getting better and to get to speak to GP is improving.

It was the intervening couple of weeks that were the worst; had I known however how good the whole process was going to be at the Angiogram suite in East Surrey Hospital, then most of my worries would have been eased. Right from the moment I stepped into the suite, I was looked after by a team of wonderful doctors, nurses, assistants, cleaners and tea ladies. Every stage was clearly explained, I was lead through the whole process and really couldn’t have asked for more - apart from not having to be there in the first place perhaps.  \r\nMy outcome was positive - just keep taking the tablets - but I suspect that if further action was required, I would have been cared for in the same, professional, caring manner. Thank you to Dr Iqbal and the very kind lady doctor in the red scrubs - (I’m sorry your name came first and my mind was buzzing) - Mency, Winston, Jeanie, Catia and Daniel who managed to find my hidden veins when so many hospitals have failed in the past, plus all the others in the suite who shaved bits, stuck on bits etc. and the lovely cleaner with dark hair who sang quietly whilst she cleaned the bathroom and chatted and the lady who bought in that first beautiful cup of tea. It’s these things that make a hospital special. Thank you.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-10-18T19:14:58.03","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-10-20T10:17:52.433","readBy":[{"name":"Surrey and Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust","count":9}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/987088?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"987088"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/987088/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"987088"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/987088/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"987088"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/987088/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"987088"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rtp04_320?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"RTP04_320","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/all%20staff?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"all staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/angiogram?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Angiogram"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/caring?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"caring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/catering%20staff?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"catering staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/chest?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"chest"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/chest%20pain?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"chest pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cleaners?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"cleaners"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctors?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"doctors"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/health%20care%20assistants?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Health Care Assistants"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/heart?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"heart"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/important?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"important"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/information?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"information"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kind?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"kind"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurse?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"nurse"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professional?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"professional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20for?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wonderful?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"wonderful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/explanations?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"explanations"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/great%20team?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"great team"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/987890?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"987890"}]},{"id":987831,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Okay practice ","body":"Overall the practice is okay but I do feel like sometimes I have to diagnose myself to be taken seriously.

I had a CT scan followed by a lumbar puncture. I then had a second CT scan. I was informed by a junior doctor on the ward that I was at risk of an aneurysm due to a pinched cerebral artery and may need a stent fitting to resolve the problem.  \r\nThis came as a big shock and caused considerable stress to me and my family due to the perceived risk and uncertainty of both the procedure and aftermath. I was then told by my registrar consultant that I had been misinformed the evening before and the explanation given was inaccurate. He then explained that I would need a final MRI scan to make 100% sure everything was in order.  \r\nThis was carried out, and I was given a clean bill of health and discharged from hospital. I was very upset with being given inaccurate information by the junior doctor and the stress that it caused me overnight. I didn’t expect this to happen and feel that there was a poor level of advice albeit this was corrected the following morning.  \r\nOverall I was pleased with the level of care I was given, although this was tainted somewhat by the situation described above.

Stop prioritising washes before the dayshift come in - especially when washes are not done properly or with the persons wants and wishes in mind.  \r\nSecondly, and this cannot be attributed to short staffing- but we found the attitude, language and tone used especially by healthcare support workers is shocking. How can you accuse an elderly person of not being unwell enough or that they should have known better because they’ve been incontinent?! I cannot imagine why staff would speak to others in this way never mind patients.  \r\nAdditionally- don’t forget that feeding those in hospital is incredibly important for their health journey but also as a human need. Cold, inedible food cannot be acceptable- surely there needs to be a minimum temperature of food served.  \r\nPlease encourage staff to be considerate and compassionate, if all the washes are not done it’s okay- it’s 24/7 care and some people - myself included- would be outraged to be woken at 06:00 for a barely basin wash, rushed and felt to be like a lump of dough.  \r\nPlease reinforce how powerful language is when speaking to patients and how this greatly impacts the patient and human experience.  \r\nI greatly understand staffing pressure and the difficulties each staff member of every band face but this cannot excuse the care delivery given especially to those who are most vulnerable.","criticality":"moderately

My wife took me to A&E, where they admitted me for 10 days. I was found to have a condition called SCAD, which is very very rare in men.They sometimes heal, but mine didn’t so the thought of the unknown took me over the edge. My anxiety got worse and worse because of my condition. I was not allowed to lift anything or exercise. I started to feel useless and that I was of no use to my family. I began to get thoughts of they would be better if I wasn’t here.  \r\nThat's when I turned to my GP for help and medication, but he said I can’t have any. I was now at my wit's end, and found out about Inclusion from the call in that morning. I immediately felt as if I had some help. First I did an online panic course which at first seems like, How’s that going to work?  \r\nWell, 6 weeks of online sessions and the difference was amazing. I was able to get back to 90% of a normal life. They then gave me a worry by course of 6 weeks and at first you think, Hows this going to help? But as a 61-year-old who’s had anxiety my whole life, it works. It is such a simple technique, but it works lol.  \r\nYou have to keep at it every day, 20 mins allocated, but as I have said it works. You don’t cure anxiety, but you ignore it, live with it. I am back to work, awaiting heart operations, and yes I have moments when I’m anxious, it’s normal to worry about having a heart procedure, but I’m able to let anxiety run its course and cope after all. Anxiety has never killed anyone.  \r\nFinally, I would like to thank all the staff at Inclusion. They are a welcoming, nonjudgmental, helpful group of professionals.

I felt it lifted my heart as it made everyone smile and it was wonderful to see other patients and staff take part.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-10-19T08:59:35.89","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-10-20T10:50:52.86","readBy":[{"name":"Southern Health and Social Care Trust","count":4}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/987442?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"987442"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/987442/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"987442"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/987442/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"987442"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/987442/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"987442"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_32022-w3?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"zt003_32022-w3","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/activities?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"activities"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/included?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"included"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/knee?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"knee"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/level%20of%20care?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"level of care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/rehab?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"rehab"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happy?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"happy"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/987938?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"987938"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/987941?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"987941"}]},{"id":987852,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Missing information","body":"I am looking for directions to the fracture clinic and can find no reference to it in the departments list or on the map of the hospital.

This ended with him walking with his foot turned inwards and limping. I called NHS 24 and the call was answered right away. The call handler was lovely and took all details and passed them onto a clinician.  \r\nThe clinician then referred us to a clinical nurse advisor at our local health board, NHS Forth Valley. We received a phone call within around 20 minutes and she had us booked in for an appointment at Stirling Minor Injuries 40 minutes later.  \r\nWe were seen right away by an ANP who was so lovely and patient with my son. We then had X-ray done 10 minutes later and straight back to ANP. The service was just outstanding from start to finish. No waiting around for ages and lovely faces.

He even opened it before her and threw it at her, demanding that she read it whilst withholding the envelope. He should not be in a front-facing role and he definitely needs behavioural training. He also doesn’t answer the phone so booking an appointment is almost impossible. It is not acceptable to have such an obnoxious and socially inept individual organising a medical centre that involves potentially life-threatening cases.\n","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-10-20T07:17:07","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-10-20T11:13:38","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/987868?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"987868"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/987868/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"987868"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/987868/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"987868"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/987868/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"987868"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/m88006?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"M88006","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hand?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"hand"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1012748?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1012748"}]},{"id":987034,"author":"A Nother","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"My recent stay as a Patient...","body":"I required to attend the A & E unit on a very busy Sunday at the start of October.
