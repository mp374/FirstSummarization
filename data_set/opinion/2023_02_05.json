We always felt confident in their ability to care for her so closely. The teams who work in Delivery as well as the Templar Ward are equally as astonishingly good at what they do - everything in Delivery runs like clockwork, and I always felt safe and listened to. The staff in surgery made me feel calm which I’ve never felt before in a surgical procedure. Templar Ward - the nurses and midwives there are angels. We were treated like people and the kindness they showed me is something I’ll never forget. My husband and I are forever indebted to everyone in these teams who looked after all of us with such gentle care at a really vulnerable time. Thank you so much.

How everything when I or members of my family have needed healthcare this has been provided with individual care and dedicated time for appointments. What I do see when I need to visit which isn’t very often is the amount of patients not attending for appointments which is causing other patients delays, those patients who don’t attend who cannot be bothered to cancel should be taken off the register after missing 3 or more appointments. The nhs does a fantastic service for the uk and we have to remind ourselves how lucky we are. Not all faults of the nhs service are down to a practice. \nThe whole team in this practice are caring and doing a fantastic job.

I am a terrible patient for blood giving yet the nurses alway treat me with extreme care and somehow make me feel at ease. \nThe doctors in this practice should be praised more for what they do; from personally experience over the years truly miss those doctors who have retired and am pleased that this practice has a core group of doctors that have worked here for many years which help with relationship with patients. \nThank you Havant health centre for looking after me and my family. \n","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2023-02-05T09:54:48","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-02-05T15:46:24","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1026344?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1026344"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1026344/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1026344"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1026344/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1026344"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1026344/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1026344"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/j82196?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"J82196","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"blood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/group?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"group"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lucky?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"lucky"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/terrible?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"terrible"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20lucky?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"very lucky"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20pleased?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"very pleased"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/feel%20at%20ease?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"feel at ease"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pleased?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"pleased"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20ease?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"at ease"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"covid"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%2019?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"covid 19"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20pleased?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"not pleased"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20at%20ease?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"not at ease"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1031290?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1031290"}]},{"id":1026343,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Pleasant and Caring Practice","body":"I recently moved to the area and was recommended this practice.

I often find I have non-urgent or admin queries out of hours (like over the weekend) that do not need to be triaged or dealt with until later the following week but due to suffering very bad brain fog, I will usually forget I need to ask the question by Monday. \nFor example, today I want to know if there is any way I can have a back-up prescription for my meds as (thanks, brain fog) I often forget to order them, and spend several days off them; like at the moment. That’s a really non-urgent query but I have to wait until Monday to ask (either by eConsult - what a waste of triage time - or by spending an hour or so on the phone - what a waste of mine and the receptionists time). At which point, I’ll be back at work, hopefully have collected my meds and won’t even remember I needed to ask the question. \nAs someone who is a sufferer of two long-term chronic illnesses that can cause severe brain fog, I often feel quite excluded by this lack of communication options and like I’m left with no where to turn. Which has had me extremely upset and in tears on several occasions because I can’t even send an email with a simple admin query.\nI have reviewed this similar experience several times for years via the feedback button on their online consultation service, but have seen no change. I don’t see the point in an online consult service that is still only available during practice hours. Surely it’d be easier at that point to call the surgery? Personally, I think that’s why the phone lines are still so busy. When they first installed the eConsult service, you were able to submit a consult at any time day or night, which was perfect. It would then be triaged the next time the practice was open and dealt with accordingly. If this was the case, I wouldn’t even mind using the service to submit admin/non-urgent queries in place of an email address. \nI really thought that the eConsult service was going to be the solution to overloaded practice receptions but it’ll never work if it’s only as convenient as making the phone call anyway. At least then people know someone’s already heard them.

It is a bit of an inconvenience as this is my first child, and my first experience and i never felt so alone in my pregnancy.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2023-02-05T16:06:56","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2023-02-05T21:15:03","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1026428?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1026428"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1026428/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1026428"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1026428/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1026428"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1026428/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1026428"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/y02928001?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Y02928001","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/inconvenience?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"inconvenience"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/alone?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"alone"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pregnancy?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"pregnancy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pregnant?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"pregnant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/struggling?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"struggling"}]},{"id":1026427,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Friendly, professional and efficient.","body":"I came to have a leg with cellulitis redressed.

I had known very little about the procedure prior to the pre-op visit and was much reassured by the care I received. \nThe facilities are very good, with free hot drinks and biscuits for myself and my husband, who was my driver for the day, should we require them. There is always someone to contact if if I  had any issues whilst waiting to be called in for my op. \nAltogether, it was a much more pleasant experience than I had expected and the outcome - which I know can be variable in how long it takes to show - for me, at least, has been an amazing improvement in the sight of my left eye.

The whole process for me was made enjoyable for me by the happy attitude of these professionals.  \r\nI left feeling very proud and privileged, to experience such 5 star treatment in my own county of Down.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-02-02T08:21:42.3833333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-02-06T09:42:04.82","readBy":[{"name":"South Eastern Health and Social Care Trust","count":3}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1025164?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1025164"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1025164/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1025164"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1025164/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1025164"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1025164/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1025164"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt004_14028_110?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"ZT004_14028_110","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/5%20star?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"5 Star"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/consultant?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"consultant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/examination?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"examination"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gentle?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"gentle"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/great%20experience?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Great experience"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/patient?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"patient"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/polite?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"polite"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/privileged?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"privileged"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professional?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"professional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/proud?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"proud"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/quick%20service?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"quick service"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/receptionist?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"receptionist"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thorough?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"thorough"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/understanding?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"understanding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/x-rays?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"x-rays"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassion?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"compassion"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happy?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/technician?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"technician"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1027198?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1027198"}]},{"id":1026483,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Outstanding Practice","body":"We have been registered with the Medwyn Practice for over 25 years and the service we have received over that time has been excellent.
