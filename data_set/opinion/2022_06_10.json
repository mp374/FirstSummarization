[{"id":945769,"author":"charliegj94","authorRoleId":3,"authorRole":"a parent/guardian","title":"Adult son and lack of help from Drug and Alcohol Single Point of Access Rhondda (Barod)","body":"My son was referred to DASPA over two months ago. His worker contacted him and visited him one or two weeks later. This is the first time my son has actively tried to engage with drug services for his cannabis dependency and it was promising that he asked for the help. His specialist therapist informed us that if he engages with the key worker then there is a good chance of gaining health funding to access longer term rehab. For the first time in a long time my son had hope.  \r\nHowever, fast forward a month or so and he has been let down so often by his keyworker not turning up to appointments, not phoning when they said they were going to phone, and the process of trying to chase them up, that he feels resigned that there is no help for him.  \r\nI can’t express enough how upsetting it is for a young adult to have this hope taken away from him.  \r\nLast time we spoke to DASPA the key worker suggested that they haven't been able to get hold of my son, that the call had gone straight to voicemail. However this has not happened to anyone who has tried to phone him. Furthermore, the key worker had his dad and my number. I tried phoning and texting but I received no response.  \r\nI am shocked and appalled that vulnerable people are left feeling helpless by the organisations who are supposed to be there to help them. I want something done about this so it doesn’t happen to anyone else but I cannot find information on their website about who to complain to.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-06-08T21:00:22.9066667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-06-10T07:50:29.41","readBy":[{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2022)","count":1},{"name":"Cwm Taf University Health Board","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/945769?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"945769"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/945769/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"945769"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/945769/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"945769"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/945769/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"945769"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/7a5yh?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"7A5YH","score":1},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sad?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"sad"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cannabis?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"cannabis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/drug?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"drug"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"staff"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/946957?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"946957"}]},{"id":945547,"author":"Maccers28","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"They kept me alive","body":"I just want to put in writing my thanks and gratitude to the staff at Royal Victoria Hospital & Lagan Valley Hospital.  \r\nI had 2 heart attacks, actually died in theatre for 8 mins, woke up in ICU wired up to a life support machine for a week, but the team at RVH were excellent.  \r\nThey kept me alive and that is something I will always be thankful for.

Nurses and receptionist have been outstandingly amazing to talk to, phone calls back very fast. Being there for advice. Never once did they make me second guess my thoughts and have been there to support me even months after.  \r\nThey’re incredible each and every one of them. To the point I got emotional on the phone, after how nice the nurse was to me. Yes I had to travel and stay with my sister in Aberdeen for a short period but it was well and truly worth it.  \r\nThe service I’ve received in Aberdeen Health village is second to none. I will be travelling down to get a coil fitted, over 360 miles. That’s because of how everyone in the health village has made me feel! Seriously incredible!

When my son was being cared for in the NICU everything was great and the nurses were wonderful. I felt that they really understood the trauma i had been through, that they understood my worries and fears for my son and that they respected my role as his mother and primary caregiver. I was included in every aspect of his care, was informed of all the details of his treatment and asked for my consent and input.  \r\nWhen my son moved to the scbu there was a dramatic and traumatic change in the treatment I received. I overheard members of the nursing team talking in derogatory terms about some of the mothers with babies in the unit. I witnessed tiny babies being left to cry and even heard one nurse openly slating the concept of kangaroo care. All the guidance I read both in preparation for becoming a mother and once my son was born recommended this type of care as the gold standard. I was aware that all babies but in particular premature babies benefit immensely from as much skin to skin contact as possible and that it is impossible to \"spoil\" a baby by holding them too much. This staff member suggested that if I continued kangaroo care my son would be clingy and spoilt. To hear this from a professional was extremely confusing for me especially as a new first time mother trying my best to bond with and nurture my child. I was discouraged from breastfeeding my child on demand by the same staff member, and I was advised to leave my child in his incubator. Again this was contrary to all the research I had done in advance regarding breastfeeding. This incident completely broke me. I started having panic attacks and no longer felt welcome in the SCBU. I had plans to sit with my son during the night but was told to leave and that they don't let parents stay overnight. However, I witnessed many other parents staying overnight. I felt like because I was clearly a single parent I was treated differently from other two parent families.  \r\nI told another SCBU staff member about the incident and they asked if they could speak to a senior member of staff about it and I agreed. Unfortunately, this did not help. This staff member spoke to me and said that it was the same as if someone was raped and came forward years later to report it - that not much is going to be done about it. Using a sexual assault analogy seemed incredibly inappropriate to me and the fact that my real and legitimate concerns were dismissed so cruelly was very upsetting.  \r\nThe time my son had left in the SCBU was absolute torture with there was little to no discussion with me about discharge plans for my son. I felt every day that there was no end date in sight. When I did manage to get some discussion about a possible discharge plan for my son (at my insistence) I was told that there was no problem, and that I could stay at the weekend to establish breastfeeding. This was after I pushed the issue quite forcefully (or as forcefully as I could manage given that I was exhausted, distressed, had just been through major surgery and was very concerned about treatment I and my child were receiving). I was incredibly confused and concerned by the fact that I alone, and not the medical professionals, was left to consider a plan for my son's discharge. I was then told I might not get to stay because another mother might be staying in the room. Staff offered no explanation as to why the other mother was being prioritised nor did they offer an alternative plan to allow me to care for my son.  \r\nI really feel that the treatment we received in the SCBU was substantially below standard and even now, two years later, I find it difficult to reflect on that time without becoming very upset.","criticality":"strongly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-06-04T12:42:46.1833333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-06-10T08:28:06.58","readBy":[{"name":"Northern Health and Social Care Trust","count":7},{"name":"Public Health Agency","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/944537?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"944537"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/944537/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"944537"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/944537/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"944537"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/944537/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"944537"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt002-aah-neonatal?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"zt002-aah-neonatal","score":1},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breastfeeding%20support?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Breastfeeding Support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/discharge%20process?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Discharge process"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/empathy?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"empathy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/management?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"management"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nicu?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"nicu"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/premature?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"premature"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professionalism?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"professionalism"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attitude?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"staff attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/traumatised?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"traumatised"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/uncomfortable?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"uncomfortable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unheard?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"unheard"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/uninformed?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"uninformed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/trauma%20informed%20care?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"trauma informed care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lost?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"lost"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/comments%20made?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"comments made"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breastfeeding%20education?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"breastfeeding education"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/946186?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"946186"}]},{"id":943596,"author":"defenderqd35","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Giving birth in Antrim during covid","body":"I was induced at 40w 1 day due to a large baby, back in March 2020. When I was induced I was told my partner would be allowed in. Then the rules changed that day but they would let him stay as he was already in.  \r\nHowever when my waters broke and I was in full established labour he was sent home despite me being told I was going to the delivery suite an hour earlier at 7pm. I was distressed and in a lot of pain.  \r\nA midwife came and took the gas and air off me and my mobile phone that I was using to communicate with my partner and told me to go to sleep even tho I was in full labour. I don't know how long it was before another midwife came to check me and gave me back my pain relief.  \r\nI texted my partner at 1am to tell him I was going to delivery. At 5am I was finally moved to delivery. I'm not sure what drips were attached me, neither is my partner as he was not present. I know I had gas and air and diamorphine as pain relief. I think I got pitocin as my contractions were stopping and starting. I was then given Remifentanil, which I did consent to as I was in so much pain.  \r\nI had been pushing for 2 hours. Baby's head was in an awkward position plus he was large, so a decision was made to use forceps. They injected the perineum with anaesthetic and immediately cut me, but the area was not numb. Then brought the forceps in.  \r\nI was held down in the bed as the pain was unbearable. I'm not sure if this is a correct procedure or should this have been done in theatre with appropriate pain relief? There was no immediate danger to baby or myself as far I was aware.  \r\nAfter giving birth my contractions stopped and I had a retained placenta which needed to be removed in surgery. I then got a spinal block and ended up numb from the chest down.  \r\nWhen I returned from surgery I was cleaned, dressed and sent to postnatal less than an hour after. My partner wasn't allowed in. I was still numb and didn't have the correct care. I remember my baby crying and I reached over to bring him to me to soothe him as I couldn't take it any longer. I dread to think what could have happened if I dropped him or fell out of the bed with him.  \r\nI was discharged the next afternoon with little information on aftercare and zero information on what happened in surgery.

Other than that the nurses on this ward have been proving good care to me, the food is okay I’ve got very sick of it, although I never find myself going hungry.","criticality":"minimally critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-06-08T19:27:14.5533333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-06-10T09:05:36.963","readBy":[{"name":"Southern Health and Social Care Trust","count":3}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/945731?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"945731"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/945731/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"945731"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/945731/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"945731"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/945731/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"945731"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_32024_320?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"ZT003_32024_320","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/boredom?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"boredom"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/heart?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"heart"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/heart%20attack?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"heart attack"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/operation?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"operation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery%20wait?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"surgery wait"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/946611?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"946611"}]},{"id":945593,"author":"Shagq75","authorRoleId":7,"authorRole":"a staff member posting for a carer/relative","title":"You can tell they love their jobs","body":"Accident and emergency was fine, it was quick and efficient.

He was late. He did not apologise. He came across as arrogant, disinterested, dismissive and judgemental. His tone was uncaring. He kept interrupting me. He made little eye contact. He mostly spoke about himself, his PhD and his research most of the time, including an apparent TV appearance. He was very scruffy and unkempt in appearance. Although he was late, he ended the session early. He glossed over the risk assessment. To my shock, he informed me at the end of the first appointment that he did not think he could help me, and, against my wishes, discharged me, even though I disclosed to him I was feeling suicidal. I was left feeling completely disillusioned, demoralised and abandoned by the Shefield IAPT service. \nAfter this awful session I contacted Sheffield IAPT admin and asked to be reassigned to another clinician.

Neighbour contacted GP who contacted myself as next of kin but I don't live in London. GP felt he needed assessment for admission he has been sectioned many times before. he has a mental health team but family have no contact and the GP said they haven't been contacted him for over 2 yrs even when my brother had been in hospital. I come to London find my brother living in terrible conditions really bad and I call the crisis team because we have no idea how to contact community team. I asked if he was under a team they refused to say - my brother was standing next to me said it was OK to ask but he doesn't like the phone and he is now very paranoid and clearly needs help beyond a GP. Was told nothing could do and put phone down on me.  \r\nThere is a really good post on here already from others told exactly the same as we have been told.  \r\nI cant stay in London because I have a job and live in another city and also have responsibilities and I am not my brothers carer because I spent 12 years before doing almost all the care. because even then this mental health NHS trust was terrible. I had to give up my university place because there was no carer support then like now. Called crisis line again and was told because I was there they wouldn't come out and assess. Didn't care I was only there for a few days didn't care GP really worried told me to call them when I was leaving .  \r\nThis hospital is paid a lot of money to provide care and they are not doing it at all as far as i can tell. To tell families that we have to look after our loved ones is a pattern for so long and it is their job. Families have to give up their lives because of these people and it is the NHS and they should be doing the job paid for. They couldn't even be bothered to come out and assess when I could give access. They hadn't bothered to try contact him at all and gave no thought to how they would do so once I had gone home. In the end he went missing and 3 weks later we were contacted by a London hospital treating him because he had collapsed. These mental health people really dont care. Why isn't someone checking on them. My brother deserves better than these people. Community team awol all during this.","criticality":"strongly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-06-01T13:27:17.4366667","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2022-06-10T09:13:18.123","readBy":[],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/944023?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"944023"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/944023/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"944023"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/944023/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"944023"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/944023/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"944023"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/taf?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"TAF","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"mental health"}]},{"id":945716,"author":"Infantdevlin","authorRoleId":3,"authorRole":"a parent/guardian","title":"Transport for EEG for infant son","body":"NISTAR provided a nurse led ambulance for the transport of our 7 day old son for an EEG scan in the Royal Belfast.

Everyone was helpful and cheerful and it was good to know that someone had us in sight. My husband did not want to go to hospital and so from that point of view all was good and he remained at home. About two years ago he had a similar illness and was taken into hospital, (for well over a week from memory).  \r\nThe things which we found difficult were:  \r\nHe felt overwhelmed when the team came in two’s and threes, although understanding that perhaps some of this was due to training, two or three strangers standing in your small room when you are feeling ill and uncertain is a strain.  \r\nHe felt intimidated when they came and stood over him – it was better when they spoke to him at his sitting level, e.g. some people knelt in front of him  \r\nHe found it difficult to hear through the masks, especially those people who spoke quickly and/or used ‘NHS jargon or abbreviations’. Even if he could hear he found the use of professional terms difficult as he was a little confused during some of the visits  \r\nOn practical help, the continence help came too late – it would have made life easier if we had been given that earlier in his illness, I have lost track of time but I think that Allison introduced us to it towards the end of May and he had already been ill for a fortnight by then, and I was exhausted by his broken nights and constant lavatory needs.  \r\nI experienced the strain of trying to care for him on my own, being on my own I found that by the time I had washed and dressed him it was nearly lunch time, by the time I had given him breakfast it was moving to late afternoon and so lunchtime moved to late afternoon early evening and quite often the last meal was missed. Toilet breaks and visits from your team made meal times even more haphazard and I couldn’t seem to get that under control at all. I was very worried that I seemed unable to feed him properly, especially as he is diabetic.  \r\nI think the last visit to us from your team was over two weeks ago (from memory), since then we have not been contacted by a community nurse or by a physiotherapist, both were mentioned to us as being ‘ordered’ for us. So we have gone from daily visits to feeling alone with no contact with anyone in NHS although we have a phone number to ring so we realise we could have support if we had a pressing problem.  \r\nHe is much better now, he is able to wash his ‘top half’, he got some of his own breakfast this morning and he has managed to take a short walk outside the house. We would be grateful if you could pass on our thanks for all the care we had.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-06-08T16:54:57.4566667","progress":"Made change","dateOfPublication":"2022-06-10T09:17:16.537","readBy":[{"name":"Southern Health Mid & North Hampshire","count":2},{"name":"Southern Health NHS Foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/945717?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"945717"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/945717/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"945717"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/945717/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"945717"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/945717/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"945717"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rw1-ucr-mid-hants?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"rw1-ucr-mid-hants","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bacterial%20infections?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"bacterial infections"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20test?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"blood test"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/continence?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"continence"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/continence%20service?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"continence service"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/overwhelmed?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"overwhelmed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cheerful?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"cheerful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tired?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"tired"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stayed%20at%20home?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"stayed at home"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/onward%20referal?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"onward referal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/physical%20assessment?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"physical assessment"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/946212?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"946212"}]},{"id":945720,"author":"Weeberry57","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"I want to give other patients hope if they have the fear","body":"I would like to thank the staff in the Endoscopy unit In VHK for their compassion and kindness given to me.

I was surprised to be offered an assessment as have been refused help for so long. It took place at the Irwell unit at Fairfield General Hospital.  \r\nWhen I arrived there was no reception and no member of staff to report to. Just a locked ward so I couldn't even tell anyone I had arrived. Eventually I saw someone and asked them to pass on the message.  \r\nA female nurse showed me into room. Inside was a male wearing jogging bottoms and slippers. He seemed agitated and was showing loudly about being a witness. He didn't introduce himself and he wasn't wearing a staff lanyard. No uniform. I felt he was a patient.  \r\nHe sat in the entire assessment which i found disturbing because he didn't seem professional and his demeanor was odd. The assessment was very stressful. I was asked a lot of personal questions whilst the nurse typed the answers. She was hostile and it felt like a police interview as a suspect. I was given no time to answer or formulate my thoughts. I have autism and ADHD and struggle with communication. It was quickfire questions jumping from one subject to the next. No compassion or sensitivity. One minute asked about abuse the next whether I lived in a house. If I found something upsetting there was no acknowledgement just cold, clinical and unfeeling.  \r\nA one point I asked the man in the room his role but he failed to respond.  \r\nAfter she had finished the nurse asked my consent to send the report to other professionals. I asked her if I will I get a copy? She said -no' I would have to make a subject access request. I said -in that that case no. How do I consent to something I havent seen myself?  \r\nShe told me they would not be offering a service and suggested I buy my own care.  \r\nAfterwards I phoned up to ask who the man in the room was who declared he was a witness and was very adversarial.

My sister has schizophrenia. She is supposedly under a community team in Camden and has been for years. They fail to make appointments . They refuse to send letters but she doesn't have a phone and quite rightly doesn't answer the door to unexpected callers as it is unsafe to do so and then they complain they cant get to see her. During covid they left her for 5 months without any contact and she was found in a terrible state by emergency council plumbers. No food, no heat, no money in the meter as her benefits had been cut off. I was told they were 'looking out for her' when I called because we couldn't visit. She was neglected and really unwell.  \r\nThe GP tries very hard but says they don't tell him when she is admitted or discharged form wards where she ends up because no one has cared. No point ever ringing that crisis line as no one there seems to know what they are doing they don't take messages for the team she is meant to be under they refused to ask the council to check on her and said they could send police . Which would just terrify her like it does everyone they do that to. All we wanted to make sure she was ok then and since then after she has been home she hasn't been for her monthly injection. I know confidentiality is very important but it is used to try shut up carers and family way too many times for her team are very quick to ring us if she needs admission and there are no beds and they want us to stop everything and look after her. Which if her community team were doing their jobs in the first place she wouldn't need. Why does no one check up on this Trust?  \r\nShe wont go and get help so is easy to just ignore it seems and the crisis line are always so obstructive they never think of safeguarding responsibility I think their only role is to gatekeep the hospital beds . Not joined up is understatement of the decade they cant even manage very basic communication like writing your patient a letter with an appointment. Apparently too hard to do so they can then say she didnt open the door to the complete stranger from the community team","criticality":"strongly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-05-31T15:13:43.4933333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-06-10T09:27:57.75","readBy":[{"name":"Camden and Islington NHS Foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/943635?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"943635"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/943635/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"943635"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/943635/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"943635"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/943635/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"943635"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/taf?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"TAF","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/isolated?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"isolated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"communication"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/950287?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"950287"}]},{"id":945722,"author":"Thank Morgmorg","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Help from Debs at IPS Futures","body":"I was referred by my mental health worker who was my 3rd at Manor. I was not sure about if I could work and struggled to be positive about my future. I suffer from Bi Polar and not everyone understands being manic or so low you wish you did not exist. I also was concerned like my workers, Debs would just leave. This did not happen, we worked together for a year.  \r\nI can't remember how many jobs I applied to, but Debs was there from application to interview, she once took me on a jobs thing. Debs took me and printed off my cv to take and we went to the jobs thing in Notts. I got a offered 2 jobs and at first got a bit scared as I thought I could not do it as one had some stuff I could not do, Debs spoke with the employer and arranged a training course which helped with my computer work.  \r\nThanks to her I can do this story as before computers were a mystery and although its a while ago I worked with her I think of her often as things changed within me, my confidence got so much better and my skills. I have not had a single day off since April 2021 when I started, where as before in other jobs my bi polar won.  \r\nThanks Debs for taking the time to really listen and persevere will telling me how good I could be in work. Also got a relationship and now having a baby I know thats not related to work but it is as met my partner there and never pictured myself as a mum so my thanks for all of it and sorry it took me a while to write this.

As soon as I listed my symptoms, the consultant said it sounded like textbook endometriosis and carried out a trans-vaginal ultrasound to confirm stage 4 deep infiltrating disease including a large 10cm cyst on an ovary and significant bowel involvement. They were absolutely shocked I hadn't been sent for any tests with the symptoms I was presenting with. They were also shocked that a large node of disease on my vaginal wall was missed during a colposcopy about 3 months before. I was so upset that after so many appointments and chances for tests to be carried out, I now had disease that had progressed so far, causing damage to many organs and potentially impacting my fertility. I was referred back to the NHS as my case is too complicated to be treated at a private hospital and will require a multidisciplinary team at the Endometriosis Centre at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital. Since being referred back to the NHS, I have had various tests including an anti-Mullerian hormone test to give a rough indication of egg reserve as fertility can be significantly impacted by Endometriosis. As I was found to have a low reading, I was referred to the Assisted Contraception Service in Glasgow to explore my options before surgery which would cause trauma to the ovaries and therefore further reduce my egg reserve. I was told at the Endometriosis centre that since October 2021, Endometriosis is now funded by the NHS for fertility treatment. However, when I had my consultation they told me that I wouldn't qualify for funding as I won't be losing my ovaries during my surgery. They said they can put my case forward to a panel to take into account my low AMH reading but couldn't guarantee I would be accepted. I found out a week later that I wasn't accepted which was very disheartening as it showed that Endometriosis is still not properly understood by medical professionals in adjacent fields. I am now back to awaiting laparoscopic surgery for my stage 4 disease, but all surgeries at the Endometriosis Centre at the Queen Elizabeth have been off since mid-September 2022, meaning no treatment for anyone of their waiting list for almost 9 months. This is due to overspill of hospital inhabitants into gynaecology as it is seen as 'benign' and 'routine' when the symptoms of Endometriosis are severe and life-limiting. It's very unfortunate that women's health gets such little acknowledgement, research and funding, which is now leading to extreme backlogs and suffering that didn't need to happen. As a disease that is as common as diabetes and asthma in women (1 in 10), it is shocking how unknown/misunderstood it is amongst GPs, nurses, and incredibly, apparently gynaecologists too, with widespread misinformation. This needs to change and more emphasis needs to be placed on this condition that impacts so heavily on everyday life, and sadly, fertility too.","criticality":"moderately

My mum who is a nurse was on holiday and I phoned her, sending her pics of the injury. She immediately said it didn't look good and agreed with me to contact the doctor. I called 111 at 18.45 explaining the situation and a doctor called me back at 20.30. The doctor asked me some questions and said she needed to be seen and told me to take her to A/E for a 21.30 paediatric appointment. I duly did so and on arrival the receptionist said that I shouldn't have been told that, paediatrics is closed. (I stay in Crosshouse and could have been there within a few minutes). I was told to go to the waiting room.  \r\nFor almost the entire 2 hours I was waiting for triage my wee one cried continuously, letting her arm hang down and clearly very distressed with pain. In fact I could hear people discussing my situation saying things like this is terrible, just awful, how can they leave that child like this. One person came up to me and asked if there was anything they could do to help. Several people left the department and I heard someone say, Ive no chance if they can leave a wean like that.  \r\nAt 21.30 I was called for my child to be triaged, and it was this experience that has left me feeling frustrated, angry and shocked.  \r\nI spoke to the nurse saying I had followed all guidelines by calling 111 etc knowing how stretched the NHS is at present, and was given an appointment for 21.30 but had to wait 2 hours for her to be seen, and asked if she shouldn't have been seen sooner. The nurse told me that it didnt work that way and that she had to wait like everyone else, then started telling me about chest pains and much worse injuries that takes priority, and in what I felt was a very patronising manner. I then told the nurse that despite my daughter being in pain or discomfort she wouldn't take medicine orally and had never been able to do so, to which the staff member replied well she'll just need to, because she will be out there for 5/6 hours. (She had scarlet fever a few years back and the GP stopped the antibiotics because of the trauma it caused her having to to take them).  \r\nI looked at her in disbelief at being told that a very distressed, and clearly in severe pain, young child could be expected to wait 6 hours to be seen. I think I said something like You're joking, shes in pain!, to which I was told shes moving it around fine!  \r\nI then told the nurse that I had no choice but to complain about this whole scenario to which they asked if I was going to complain about them?  \r\nI then attempted to discuss the implications of a 6 hour wait with a distressed child and asked if I should take her home and return tomorrow. I was told that was up to me what you do, you put the pieces together and make the choice, but she will just have to wait again in the morning like everyone else.  \r\nAt this point I was really frustrated, my child was sobbing and exhausted and I was in a complete dilemma as to whether I should stay or return in the morning. I have no medical experience but remembering that my mother believed from the pics it was likely to be broken and the doctor telling me she needed seen that night, I then said to the nurse that I was frightened that if I took her home, and she has a broken bone she could do further damage to it. In what I felt was a very condescending manner the staff member replied Damage? what damage could she do?  \r\nI got up and left.  \r\nThe next day, a full 16 hours later, my daughter was diagnosed with a fractured radius.  \r\nI fully understand that the NHS have huge problems, I fully understand that long waits in A/E are the norm, and I fully understand that mistakes like getting a paediatric appointment that doesn't exist can happen, but what I will never, EVER, understand is how a very distressed young child (and her mother) can be treated so condescendingly, with such coldness, and a complete lack of empathy and care, from the caring profession.  \r\nI would like to finish by asking;-  \r\n(a) Would it have been out with the realms of procedure for my child to be given a paediatric pain relieving patch or even an anti-inflammatory gel given that the waiting time was around 6 hours?  \r\n(b) Why was my child vital signs not taken and recorded, especially her pulse with what was very clearly an injured arm?","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-06-08T13:35:25.2766667","progress":"Story has a

There was no support or advice on how to try and conceive naturally or what I could do between the appointment and my review just to go away and lose weight to be able to get on the waiting list.  \r\nI feel that doctors need to be more empathetic.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-06-08T15:56:37.9666667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-06-10T10:16:34.113","readBy":[{"name":"Belfast Health and Social Care Trust","count":9},{"name":"Ulster University, MBBS (Medicine) 2021","count":2},{"name":"Public Health Agency","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/945703?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"945703"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/945703/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"945703"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/945703/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"945703"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/945703/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"945703"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt001-rgh-fertility-clinic?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"zt001-rgh-fertility-clinic","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/angry?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"angry"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/advice?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"advice"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/empathy?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"empathy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fertility?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Fertility"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pcos?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"pcos"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20manner?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"staff manner"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/inadequate%20consultation?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"inadequate consultation"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/946801?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"946801"}]},{"id":945739,"author":"jupiterrp74","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"I was not impressed","body":"I tested + for C19 last year in hospital.

Lisa who was a member of the Admin team, kindly checked on the system for a cancellation at said clinic for the next day. Unfortunately the clinic was fully booked however she remained persistent and thoughtfully tried to contact them directly. Again to no avail with Lisa stating that she would keep trying throughout the day.  \r\nI was delighted when Lisa’s colleague Valerie contacted me at 2pm to offer me an appointment at the Hand Clinic due to a cancellation.  \r\nI am so very very grateful to everyone but particularly Lisa and Valerie who were tenacious, determined, thoughtful and kind and who went that extra mile for me.  \r\nThank

I wanted to speak to a Dr. As per surgery guidelines day 1, I called at 8am. After waiting 45 mins receptionist answered the call and with all my determination I tried to speak my name.  \r\nReceptionist started impatiently stating are you going to speak up I can't hear you, they continued to speak over me and due to this couldn't hear me and what I was attempting to say, leaving me with no option but having to try repeat myself with great difficulty. Due to covid/impaired breathing I was trying so hard to talk and asked that they please be patient with me as I was trying so much to breath/talk.  \r\nI desperately tried to speak and was told no appointments left to call back the following day. Day 2 at 8am the following day I called and again waited in a que for 40 mins was getting same will you speak up I can't hear you by this time my breathing had significantly deteriorated and I tried my hardest to talk and was told a g.p would call me back same day. I waited until 5pm no call returned. I called surgery advising I was awaiting a call back only for a receptionist to say you didn't phone here at 8am this morning as no call logged... No listening/empathy understanding and when I insisted I did call they went away looked into this and said to me only 1 Dr on today & short staffed & you been missed, so call back tomorrow morning at 8am.  \r\nFeeling worse day 3 I called at 8.00am 43rd on que after 50 minutes later receptionist answered and immediately hunt up saying I can't hear you and hung up. I called back immediately again waited in que only for call to be answered and yet again told no appointments through no fault of my own.  \r\nDay 4 phoned at 8am got appointment with a nurse that lead to me having to attend hospital immediately due to severity of my symptoms. The hospital say on arrival don't let your symptoms get as bad as this next time. Despite trying all week at g.p for appointment. All receptionist that I spoke to that week we're totally disinterested, lack of telephone skills or empathy throughout all interactions.  \r\nReception staff on dealing with them are rude, impatient, poor customer service, extremely lack communication skills both listening and verbal.From my experience I found them unprofessional and appear to lack any training on all matters that involve working with public. They seem to have little if any regard that they are first point of contact for people who are POORLY. Given that COVID has been a global pandemic that effects people's breathing why are receptionist staff hanging up on phone call after 2 seconds after waiting on hold for 50 minutes desperate to get an appointment. Reception staff would appear to have little training/knowledge/understanding on COVID/effects of COVID/respiratory issues and how to communicate effectively on a telephone which is bizarre considering reception staff are first point of contact for a g.p practice that has a duty of care to its poorly patients. This impatience and lack of tolerance demonstrates a lack of willingness to help people who are calling the surgery because they are POORLY. Yes COVID has impacted services however from my experience of this surgery over 13 yrs has been poor. When people are being advised not to attend over run and over-worked hospitals and encouraged to attend g.p to stay away from hospitals where on earth is people supposed to get g.p advice from when can't get to speak to a g.p or bypass a unhelpful receptionist. Yes I understand that I am not the only patient that is unwell and yes it is also a big practice however If I had to treat individuals in this manner in my job I would get dismissed as this would not be tolerated so don't see why it's been allowed for years in this surgery.  \r\n[Unsure about 'Staff attitude']  \r\n","criticality":"moderately

Very long story short, I had a brilliant experience in the labour ward, those girls were calm, attentive, on the ball, informative and listened. The after care in the maternity ward was a disgrace.  \r\nI had a c sections, and I am a nurse, so I was aware of the after care that was expected.  \r\nI was met by a midwife who introduced themselves, not by telling me their name but by saying, I haven't had my break yet. I had just been wheeled back from recovery after an emergency section. I saw this staff member once after that.  \r\nTo cut out all the in between stuff about poor manners, lack of communication and sheer disregard for a woman who was struggling post op the midwives had not  \r\n-done my post op observations  \r\n-checked for pp bleeding or checked my wound  \r\n-checked the baby on day two or day 3  \r\n- could not insert my cannula and I had to insert it myself WHILST BREASTFEEDING MY BABY.  \r\n-did not communicate with me or tell me that I was supposed to buzz to let them help me put the baby back into the cot or lift it out, leading to me struggling and in a lot of pain. sure why didnt you buzz? -probably because I had such a frosty reception I was too scared to.  \r\nI had no idea I was allowed as I had asked for help to latch on and they said no one would be available to help for several hours and to give a bottle instead. Try telling that to a baby thats a few hours old.  \r\nI discharged myself against medical advice as I was distraught. as I work in the health service I would never ever bash a team of people unless it was essential but this was the worst experience of my life and has left me emotionally shaken since.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-06-08T15:10:20.83","progress":"Change planned","dateOfPublication":"2022-06-10T11:38:48.093","readBy":[{"name":"Western Health and Social Care Trust","count":15},{"name":"Plymouth University BSc Child Health 2019-09","count":1},{"name":"Ulster University, MBBS (Medicine) 2021","count":1},{"name":"Patient and Client Council","count":1},{"name":"Public Health Agency","count":1},{"name":"Ulster University, Faculty of Life and Health Sciences","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/945689?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"945689"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/945689/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"945689"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/945689/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"945689"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/945689/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"945689"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt005-swah-501?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"zt005-swah-501","score":1},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/isolated?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"isolated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20being%20listened%20to?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"not being listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scared?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"scared"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/aftercare?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"aftercare"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/alone?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"alone"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/labour?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"labour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/maternity?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"maternity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/section?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"section"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/traumatised?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"traumatised"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/post-op%20care?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"post-op care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/labour%20ward%20staff?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"labour ward staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/after%20care?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"after care"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/947358?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"947358"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/957419?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"957419"}]},{"id":946218,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Breast Screening: Amazing department ","body":"I was nervous after being called to return after a mammogram.

I use the NHS App. I reset my password. I wade down the navigation and it says i have no repeat prescriptions. I use MyGP I get in using the same password, but this time it sends a code to my phone I click on several useless stages and get to my repeat prescription to find that it says rejected againsted 3 of the 4 medications. So next I go to the Vine Medical Centre Website navigate to repeat prescriptions where I have a choice of 4 options I choose the one I think I have used before. Yes its the right one because last month I chose the option to send an image of my paper prescription only to get an email from the surgery the next day to say that they cant use input from that and could I type in the list of medications. So there are methods which know what I want but dont work and the method that does works that makes me type them in. I put in quantity of 28  for 3 of them and 30 for the other. It used to let me say max because I have a stable prescrition and so 3 months would make more sense. I would save me time and 2 visits to the pharmacy, it would save the surgery 2 lots of processing and the cost of doing that, but of course the pharmacy makes more money by having 3 sales rather than 1 and I do not know why the surgery is in cahoots with this rip off.  There was a time when you could order in the morning and pick up the paper prescription that afternnoon - now because of a huge increase in housing and the government not training enough staff it can take up to 7 working days. When I get into the Medi-pharmacy I am expecting that I will then have to go through the \"game\" of \"We cant find any record of that\". If I didnt suffer from anxiety from many sources at age 76 then this alone would induce the condition. It is a mess. Combined with an attitude of we mustprotect our doctors from patient seeing them in person I dispare. When I get into the Vine itself the reception desk is variable from absolutely wonderful to down right obstructive. The doctors and clinical staff are universally excellent.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-06-09T12:33:58","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-06-10T11:45:36","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/946219?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"946219"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/946219/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"946219"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/946219/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"946219"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/946219/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"946219"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/g82164?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"G82164","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/alone?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"alone"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pharmacy?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Pharmacy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stable?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"stable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"put off"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/963150?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"963150"}]},{"id":946225,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Kind and reassuring","body":"sadly I cannot name the midwife in this review but I had the pleasure of being seen by a lovely lady in he delivery suite this morning after concerns that at 22 weeks pregnant my baby hadn’t moved for over a day.

Of course, I'm interested in my exact cholesterol levels and various other results (thyroid & kidney function etc  etc etc). \n\nSeeing that the person on the lines simply tried to get me to hang up, I requested my results so that I can interpret it myself. Even such simple request was not approved and I was pointed to their website to formally request this via some cumbersome process. Further more ... I was told that such request can't be made today, since they are already over capacity to send out reports.\n\nHow competent is a surgery, when they can't even click \"email to patient\" while discussing your records with you over the phone? My wife requested similar results a short while back, whilst speaking to the doctor and he responded immediately to her request with an automated email sent out.\n\nIt really is shocking how you either (1) can't speak to a human at the surgery anymore or (2) ALWAYS get referred back to their website for any requests that you have. EVERYTHING has to go through tedious online form submissions to make even the most basic request.\n\nAlso, my son (7yrs old) had tonsillitis a short while back. I called on a Thursday to ask to be seen and the earliest they had availability to see him, was the following week Tuesday!!! How is that possible!???? \n\nYet! ... They have recently decided to take even more patients on, whilst they already can't cope with their regular patients. \n\nThis is utterly appalling service from Fort House and their excuse of COVID being the reason is long not acceptable anymore.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-06-09T19:18:19","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-06-10T11:58:56","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/946233?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"946233"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/946233/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"946233"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/946233/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"946233"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/946233/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"946233"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/h81020?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"H81020","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appalling?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"appalling"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"blood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20tests?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"blood tests"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cholesterol?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"cholesterol"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kidney?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"kidney"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/normal?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"normal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tests?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"tests"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thyroid?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"thyroid"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tonsillitis?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"tonsillitis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"covid"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pushed%20out?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"pushed out"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%2019?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"covid 19"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pushed%20away?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"pushed away"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/947498?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"947498"}]},{"id":946231,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Blood test","body":"Blood test- general.

I had a couple of phone appointments with my supporter and he could see the questionnaire that I had completed.  I was unable to make a scheduled phone apt so I sent a msg using the app - the message has not been responded to, nor subsequent ones. I shared a couple of journal entries because I was feeling extremely low but I heard nothing.  This left me feeling far worse than before I started to engage with this service.\nWhen I log in, in the vague hope that someone might have bothered to have a look at my messages all I get is a sentence saying that my supporter is due to leave a review on 28th February - well we are now in June and if it hadn’t affected me as much as it has it would be funny.  I can honestly say that this service has done nothing but make my mental health worse and feeling completely abandoned.  With the way the world has been in the past two years it is genuinely concerning that people who are struggling are being advised to use this sub par service.  I’m sure it has potential, maybe my “supporter” just wasn’t bothered.  All I can say is when you are struggling with anxiety, depression etc, to feel unheard or ignored is devastating.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-06-09T21:54:57","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-06-10T12:09:23","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/946238?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"946238"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/946238/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"946238"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/946238/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"946238"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/946238/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"946238"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/am6?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"AM6","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/abandoned?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"abandoned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ignored?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"ignored"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/depression?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"depression"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/encouraged?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"encouraged"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/heard?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"heard"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unheard?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"unheard"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hope?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Hope"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/struggling?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"struggling"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doing%20well?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"doing well"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/worse%20than%20before?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"worse than before"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/no%20hope?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"no hope"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/947579?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"947579"}]},{"id":946236,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Fantastic experience ","body":"Your review:   I attended today for major dental surgery. Throughout the entire process, the staff were impeccable. I was made to feel at ease, the atmosphere was relaxed, friendly and professional.\n\nFrom start to finish I was kept abreast of each step of the way. I was asked numerous times about who I was, which clearly limits any mistakes. My vital signs were constantly monitored prior to my surgery. The Dentist and Anaesthetist explained in full what I was going to have. They answered my queries with ease and with total dignity.\n\nThe Nurses who looked after me; pre & post surgery were phenomenal. They were witty, friendly, kind natured and thoroughly professional.\n\nI was initially scared about my surgery as I have a real fear of all things medical. Within seconds, my anxiety was relinquished as I was met by friendly people at reception. I was led to the ward and from the very start I was welcomed, put at ease and I felt relaxed.\n\nThe Porter who led me to surgery was equally friendly and chatty.\n\nThroughout the day I was given expert advice on how to take care of myself; post surgery.\n\nIn short; every member of staff I encountered today were absolutely amazing.\n\nI want to thank and congratulate each and every one of you.\n\nEven at the start of the day when we arrived at the Hospital; we kind of got ourselves lost. The staff on the various other departments were super friendly and pointed us in the right direction.\n\nTo sum up, no, none of us likes attending Hospitals, but I can assure you this, if today’s experience is anything to go by, fear not !!\n\nThank you Trafford General ( or Park Hospital) as it was when I was growing up 😊\n\nYou have all inspired me to write this much worthy review.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-06-09T22:25:48","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-06-10T12:10:49","readBy":[{"name":"Manchester University NHS Foundation
