This resulted in me having a criminal conviction and turning to alcohol to numb the pain.  \r\nIt started off small and snowballed until it was out of control. During this time I lost two jobs, spent 5 days in the Royal Edinburgh Hospital and had multiple suicide attempts. After the last attempt I self-referred to CGL. The alcohol gave me relief for a very short period and was quickly followed by shame, self-loathing and disgust. It very nearly cost me my family.  \r\nOnce I was in the system with CGL things improved. I attended meetings when I could and was eventually started on medication. I’ve been sober since July 2021. I’ve been discharged to the care of my GP now with the understanding I can reach out to CGL should I start to struggle.  \r\nMy intention over the coming months is to find a group to attend so I have a support network in place if/when I need it. It would have been great for me if there was a meeting outwith office hours as I am now back working.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-04-03T13:59:14.04","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-04-05T08:27:48.533","readBy":[{"name":"Change Grow Live","count":10}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/928743?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"928743"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/928743/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"928743"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/928743/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"928743"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/928743/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"928743"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/nms-north-west-recovery-service-edinburgh?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"nms-north-west-recovery-service-edinburgh","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/groups?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"groups"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/out%20of%20hours%20groups?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"out of hours groups"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/929705?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"929705"}]},{"id":929090,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Not good","body":"I have been diagnosed with complex PTSD and have just been left out in the cold as for my doctors unless I phone them up about how I'm doing on my meds there is no follow up I have been waiting for the trauma team since the above date and am still suffering with my mental health it's the first time I've asked for help with this I am now 60 years old and have always managed myself with drugs then work but now I'm too broken to be working like I have at the end of my tether to be honest.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-04-02T16:13:27","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-04-05T08:54:07","readBy":[{"name":"Midlands Partnership NHS Foundation Trust o","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/929090?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"929090"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/929090/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"929090"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/929090/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"929090"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/929090/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"929090"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rrev0?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"RREV0","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/broken?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"broken"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/drugs?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"drugs"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ptsd?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"ptsd"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/930567?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"930567"}]},{"id":928742,"author":"coinrt78","authorRoleId":3,"authorRole":"a parent/guardian","title":"Fantastic care","body":"Absolutely fantastic care and compassion for my daughter getting her 2nd covid jab at the CAH allergy clinic.

I cannot complain about a single member of staff that I have had the absolute pleasure of dealing with. They have all been so helpful and caring from the sisters and doctors to the domestics and cleaners. At the start I did not enjoy the food however after being advised by the dietician to eat more regularly, I have started to accept it. I always get enough food, which is good as I am not hungry. Everything is always clean and the cleaners will always clean anything that I ask them too. I was very uncomfortable at the start of my treatment as I had catheters in to help with going to the toilet. These were necessary however, and it was explained to me why they were used. This, like all of my treatment plan was very well explained to me which is something I am grateful for. In my previous ward when I was very unwell I lost a bible and a tale given to me by the Chaplin, however I am not that worried about these items and understand things may have been misplaced.","criticality":"minimally critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-04-02T18:23:00.94","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-04-05T09:21:18.093","readBy":[{"name":"Southern Health and Social Care Trust","count":3}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/928619?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"928619"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/928619/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"928619"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/928619/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"928619"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/928619/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"928619"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_32024-4-south-surgical?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"ZT003_32024-4-south-surgical","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/caring?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"caring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cleaners?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"cleaners"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dietician?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Dietician"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctors?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"doctors"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/food?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"food"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helpful?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"helpful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/uncomfortable?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"uncomfortable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/domestics?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"domestics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/explanations?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"explanations"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lost%20items?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"lost items"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/clean?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"clean"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/a%20pleasure?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"a pleasure"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sisters?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"sisters"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/929291?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"929291"}]},{"id":928612,"author":"Saz1224","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"kind and supportive care","body":"I recently experienced really kind and supportive care in the early pregnancy unit at stepping hill.

We struggled badly to get anyone to take a holistic view of mum's health (she had other medical issues previously diagnosed). After weeks of struggles, we were eventually referred to DECS-A (Dundee Enhanced Community Support Acute Team) and that's our best experience of the NHS to date. The DECS-A team - every member - has been outstanding. They have been attentive, decisive, facilitative and extremely communicative. They actioned scans, treatment, medication and care for my mum and they kept us as a family in the loop at all times. We felt we were provided a cohesive, reliable, professional service. We felt part of the solution and mum was treated with dignity and respect. The only thing I would say could be improved is that we had never heard of this service and quite honestly it has been a god send.","criticality":"not

I have had a horrible experience. They have treated me poorly, I feel more depressed and have severe anxiety and anger because of it. They have diagnosed me with a personality disorder but never explained what that is or offered me any help for that. They said the medication I was already on prior to the diagnosis was the treatment for it. Methadone is not prescribed for personality disorders, nor are anti depressants, those were for depression and opiate use. Ever since I told them of my drug use I feel that they were discriminatory against me, and said addiction services will help but they have only put me on methadone and nothing else other than religious programs. I was never addicted to drugs, I used drugs once in a while to help my symptoms of anxiety but never addicted. Now I am addicted to methadone and am being refused mental health treatment until I get off of it. I was drug-free when I first went to them and they put me on drugs. It makes no sense. I was told I would be seeing a psychologist last year but as is usual with so much I have been told it hasn't happened and now they say I am not open to them. I was told I would be seeing Psychologist and it would be soon, that the staff member I spoke to was personally putting it through. Now I'm being told it's addiction services that would be helping me with that but only after I get off methadone. It's like I now have to be cured before I get any help. I was also assured anti-depressants would help, they did not and when I brought this up they denied ever having said that. I am still depressed, suicidal and angry. Some staff also seem to have anger issues and have not acted professionally, or treated me fairly. They say I am a manipulator but I'm only trying to get help, they are scaring me away with how they are treating me. I have had proper treatment in the past so I know how it should go.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-04-02T09:39:24.2666667","progress":"Story has a

Doctors informed the nurses of my pain management medication for the SCN to tell me that’s extreme for the pain you are experiencing, I could not walk unassisted and could only lie flat on my back, I think this is an unprofessional and not patient centred. The staff contradicted themselves, one minute my bloods were unremarkable and the next I had signs of infection yet did not give me any antibiotics for this, I believe I should have been started on antibiotics, considering I had a high temp and heartrate.  \r\nA hcsw came into the room at one point never said hello and then proceeded to abruptly place a menu for the following day on my table and say I doubt you will be needing that and then they opened the window without asking me beforehand.  \r\nAnother hcsw later came into the room and stated because I'm in my early 20's I shouldn't be getting a CT scan.  \r\nFurthermore I was discharged the following day with more painkillers, which did not help and I asked for stronger ones but was told no.

My letter stated to be at the ward at a time in the morning, however when I arrived to check in, the nurse checked the board and I was down for a PM surgery. I was told I could drink water up to 11.00 (I had stopped in the early morning, as per my letter) but it was now too late for me to have anything to eat. I was taken down for surgery in the afternoon. After changing into the gown, I went into the theatre, where 2 of the anaesthetist nurses attempted to put the canula in my left hand. After a good 5 minutes and a considerable amount of pain from prodding around, they gave up and had to use my right hand. I was left with a huge, swollen bruise and soreness in my left hand, which is still there almost 2 weeks later. I was taken back to the ward about 2.5 hours later, transferred into bed and then didn't see anyone until I got up to go to the nurses station (another 2 hours after this), to see if I could have a cup of tea and something to eat (it had been 26hrs since I last ate). The nurse said someone should have been to offer me something to eat once back on the ward (no one did). I also had to ask to have the canula removed so I could go home, and again the nurse said that I have to be back from surgery for 2hrs and have eaten before I could leave, which I had, but no one seemed to know this.  \r\nI am very disappointed at the organisation and care given. Going into hospital for surgery is stressful enough, particularly at the moment when we can't have someone with us. The fact that I had to spend all day on the ward, unnecessarily because the time of my surgery was wrong, to then not be checked on afterwards, makes the whole ordeal quite upsetting.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-04-02T08:43:04.6","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-04-05T10:26:02.013","readBy":[{"name":"United

Fortunately a friend, a retired dermatologist, suggested I get some marks on my neck looked at. My GP thought they were nothing so my friend gave me the exact words to describe what I needed - that two BCC's require excision. On giving these words to another GP I was invited to the surgery where a referral was made.  \r\nOnce in the system things moved relatively quickly considering the Covid impact. I've just had two BCC's removed on my neck and need three to be removed from my back.  \r\nUsing local anesthetic the procedure was painless and all involved welcomed me and made me feel comfortable explaining what would be done etc. They even had the decency to laugh at my pathetic jokes they've probably heard countless times. They also respected my hearing loss ensuring I understood what was going on and after care etc.  \r\nAll in all the staff involved could not have done better with what they have to work with. What a shame the system is so cumbersome and top heavy giving the NHS such a bad reputation.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-04-03T09:01:36.3966667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-04-05T10:54:16.953","readBy":[{"name":"Royal Cornwall Hospitals NHS Trust","count":7}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/928724?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"928724"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/928724/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"928724"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/928724/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"928724"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/928724/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"928724"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/ref12_330?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"REF12_330","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/quick?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"quick"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/skin%20cancer?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"skin cancer"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/welcoming?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"welcoming"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/whole%20team?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"whole team"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/clear%20explanations?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"clear explanations"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/painless%20procedure?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"painless procedure"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hearing%20loss%20awareness?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"hearing loss awareness"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/929152?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"929152"}]},{"id":929113,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Caring and compassionate ","body":"I am a recovering alcoholic and I have called an ambulance,  wanted to stop drinking but was very anxious about detox.

We waited 45minutes in our car, before receiving the message to be told when we arrived that we were late, so they had allowed other patients in before us. My daughter had her height and weight done and some other checks on her chest. We then had to wait in a corridor on a chair for 1hour 30minutes. No area for my daughter to be able to be put down, so I was desperately trying to keep her occupied on my lap (which is not easy with a newly active baby). When we got called in for her ECO scan, it was by far the worst experience I have had at the hospital (we spent a lot of time in and out of hospital with my first child). My daughter hates getting dressed and undressed and is not afraid to tell you (very loud screaming crying). Let alone this being the 3rd member of staff we’ve seen since arriving. As expected from a 10month old (I work in a nursery so she is definitely not the only one to get unsettled by strangers), my daughter screamed and cried as loud as she could as soon as the doctor looked at her, let alone trying to touch her chest. To my shock, the doctor asked me if she is always this naughty. I responded saying she’s not naughty, she doesn’t like strangers approaching her.  \r\nThe doctor then repeatedly questioned why I couldn’t settle her. I was left in the room with the doctor while I tried to get her to fall asleep (she was knackered). I told the doctor she would still wake up when they touched her as she’s a light sleeper.  \r\nThey made it clear that they were getting annoyed and made me feel like it was my fault that she was so upset. They said to come back in 4/6 months and they would have to sedate her.  \r\nThey then went on to say the complete opposite of every other doctor we had seen up until recently. I left that room crying. I’ve never been made to feel like that by a professional. I will not be returning to this doctor.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-04-02T20:34:33.3733333","progress":"Story has a

I was welcomed by a midwife who made my husband and I feel instantly at ease through fully explaining every step of the process and answering any questions I had with evidence based knowledge. The midwife and her healthcare assistant were an asset (it can be quite daunting showing your all when it's your first baby).  \r\nOn Tuesday the balloon was taken out and I was sent home to await a bed in the Labour suite to break my waters.  \r\nMy waters broke and contractions started early on Wednesday morning and triage via phone were very helpful in explaining why I'd be best to begin early labour at home until they got stronger.  \r\nBy lunchtime this became more unmanageable and I was given the choice to be reviewed by triage if I wished despite early labour which I took!  \r\nOnce accessed I was indeed in labour and taken to the Labour suite for pain management.  \r\nCatriona who was assisting from DMU took over my care with support from Pia (student midwife). Catriona made me feel very reassured and supported me to follow my birth plan wish of a natural labour as much as possible, waiting for me to call the shots in terms of pain relief instead of pushing it on me. Pia ensured that my family were cared for and nothing was of too much hassle.  \r\nLayla took over my care onto the Nightshift and in all honestly; I would like to place this woman on a pedestal for all the world to see as she is truly such an asset to the NHS.  \r\nFrom the moment I met Layla I knew she had complete control. Straight away she could see I was uncomfortable (half way down the bed) and instead of waiting until I was ready to move (which would have been never), adjusted my position according to my pain and took some easy decisions away from me so I could focus on me.  \r\nIn the evening, Layla held me up when I was close to passing out getting my epidural, never agreed with me (when I said I must've been hurting her grabbing her arm or leaning on her) and most importantly; listened to my every need.  \r\nFollowing my epidural she ensured I was fed, hydrated and rested. In between began IV drips and communicated with doctors and anesthetics about my poor vein quality and babies occasional drop in heart rate, which the consultant Rosie assessed each time. After 6 hours of more contractions and ever growing pain, Layla encouraged me to put everything into my pushing and made me feel a bit like superwoman when I pushed in the right place.  \r\nVery early the next morning, I was aware that the room was becoming more full with medical staff and Rosie (consultant) explained that baby was occasionally in distress and we needed to work very hard on my pushes.  \r\nI was consented for forceps shortly following this (just in case it were required) and thank goodness this was done without any wait as babies heart rate suddenly shot up and I was rushed to theatre very quickly to go on to have my baby less than an hour later.  \r\nIn theatre, staff explained everything well (I was so worried he hasn't cried) and let my husband be a vital part in my babies beginning of life whilst I was being cared for. Staff appeared to genuinely congratulate my husband and I and, I felt like we had all completed a marathon together with the celebrations!  \r\nRosie and a member of the anaesthetic team were so kind to visit me on the ward that evening/the next day to explain everything and I know now that if my baby had not been delivered then and there, things could have taken a turn for the worse and due to Rosie, Layla and the senior charge nurses quick decision making; I have the most perfect healthy baby.  \r\nAfter baby was born, Layla and student midwife Tia ensured I was comfortable and so compassionate when I explained the first present I opened was a knitted item from my recently deceased mother that my neighbour finished knitting.  \r\nOn ward 38 South I would like to thank all the midwives that took care of us, especially with their breastfeeding support as I know if I hadn't been an inpatient, I would have given up!  \r\nI'd like to give a special nod to the student midwife Cameron on 38 who, in a world of judgement, carried out a majority female profession with such confidence, especially in his great communication and breastfeeding support.  \r\nAs you can see by my essay that I write at a very early morning feed (hehe), I have taken the time to to give proper feedback to maternity services at Ninewells as truly I could not have had a better experience (despite the issues we had) and the staff should be truly praised for the work they do; so much more than my bag of tea and coffee could ever do.","criticality":"not

After a few hours in a hectic A&E she was transferred to ward 4 overnight and then to ward 15 for care. She was there 16 days and tested positive for covid the night before transfer to a care home, as we sadly couldn’t give give the care required at home any longer. She was transferred to ward 3 for a couple of days then onto ward 6 covid ward. Once out, her isolation in the care home was closed due to Covid issues, so she was transferred to Stonehouse Hospital for 18 days before eventually transferring to the care home. The care and support given to mum was fabulous and under Johns Campaign, I was able to visit and feed mum. The wards are struggling with high volume of patients and staff off sick yet they all took time to speak with me and ensure mum had what she required. I am proud to be a mum of an NHS nurse and see first hand what her and her colleagues do on a daily basis. They work so hard and do their very best to ensure patients and families are supported.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-04-02T21:31:24.6433333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-04-05T13:29:34.407","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lanarkshire","count":11}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/928630?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"928630"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/928630/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"928630"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/928630/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"928630"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/928630/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"928630"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l302h_180?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"L302H_180","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l302h-care-of-the-elderly?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"L302H-Care-of-the-Elderly","score":5},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l302h-coel?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"l302h-coel","score":5},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l304h?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"L304H","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fabulous?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"fabulous"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/geriatric?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"geriatric"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/isolation?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"isolation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/proud?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"proud"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"supported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/took%20time?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"took time"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"covid"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%20positive%20test?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"covid positive test"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%2019?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"covid 19"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hectic?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"hectic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/family%20stay?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"family stay"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/work%20hard?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"work hard"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/929723?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"929723"}]},{"id":928726,"author":"Days","authorRoleId":3,"authorRole":"a parent/guardian","title":"Outstanding care","body":"It wouldn’t be possible to personally thank everyone who was involved in our teenage daughter’s recent care.

attend the eye clinic at Treliske hospital. I get the train to Truro then walk over the railway bridge using the scenic walk to Treliske. I get the train in the morning (which confuses my Doggy as he thinks that he is getting an early morning walkies). Once at the hospital, I check in and wait to be called. I always wear a mask in case someone might recognize me and because of the virus. When my name is called, I go to the pre lab to see how my eyesight is doing. I think I am on my fourth jab. Both my eyes are tested with a one eyed jack to see if my vision is improving in my left eye. It is. Once I am through, I am shown to a comfy chair in front of the operating room. I manage to read half a page of my current book before being called in. I lie down on a bunk bed and am given drops to anaesthetize my eye. Next is the injection and I have to be very still. Difficult. All of this is done with great care and attention from the nurses. I am most grateful that this treatment is available to me and delivered with such gentle kindness. I don't think I would be able to pay for this wonderful treatment if our health service was privatised.

He is non verbal and autistic. I took him to this clinic for a blood test today. It was understandably a distressing experience for him, and the staff taking his blood did their best.\n\nWhat happened afterward with the receptionist was the problem. My son was upset, and after multiple attempts to clean him up and cover his wound, had blood over half of his face. Seeing that all he wanted was to get outside, the clinical assistant led us to the first of three exits we were not allowed to use. \n\nThe third one she left us at was the one we had entered through. I pressed the button to leave, my son crying his eyes out, blood all over his face. The receptionist, who had barely looked up when checking us in, took the trouble to come out of her booth to tell us that we were not allowed to go through that door. \n\nI explained that we had already been lead to two other exits, neither of which was accessible, and that we had just been lead to this one. She simply repeated that we were not allowed to go through that door. She had allowed a patient through that door when we were in the waiting room earlier. He appeared more obviously disabled than more son. \n\nThe door is made of glass. There was no one on the other side, or outside of the building. No. Instead, for the sake of Covid safety, we had to pass 5 people in the waiting room and go around the building to the fourth exit. This is not Covid safe, despite her blind following of the rules. \n\nIt was obvious my son was upset. Obvious what he needed. It would take nothing to let us through that door. It was far more important to her to exercise the little power she has. \n\nPlease try to read the situation. You could have lessened his suffering with just a little compassion.

The care we received was second to none and I have felt strongly that I must send a message, commenting on my positive experience as I feel the staff involved really warrant recognition.  \r\nI was scheduled for a caesarean section for the Thursday morning and having gestational diabetes, it meant I had to stay over night beforehand to be monitored. I was taken care of by a lovely midwife called Jenny, who could not have done any more to make sure I was relaxed, before going down for the surgery and made sure I knew what was involved. I was then met by Rachel and Fionnuala down in delivery, who again put me through the process, ensuring I was aware of what would be happening and in what structure. Both girls were so knowledgeable and offered to answer any questions my husband and I had. They put me completely at ease and just added to the whole experience. Dr Lydia, Dr Mairead and Dr Colin were just amazing during the section and talked to me throughout making sure I knew what was going on every step of the way!  \r\nAfter a successful surgery, we were brought to recovery where my husband and I were brought the most amazing tea and toast. Due to a Cat1 call, midwife Fionnuala had to run so we were put in the care of trainee midwives, Erin and Laura. Again, both girls were just amazing and monitored both my son and I until we were able to go back to the ward. (Fionnuala then came up to the ward at the end of her shift to check on me and baby which I thought was just so lovely!)  \r\nIn the ward (2 West) my care really was second to none. I was looked after by midwife Margaret, who was so attentive to both me and my son. Anything I asked of her was no problem. She was so thorough and it was clear she is so passionate about what she does. Health care assistant, Vicky, was also someone who really stood out to me in my short stay in hospital. She went out of her way to make sure I was freshened up after the surgery so I would start to feel myself again and got a fan for the room. It is clear it is a real vocation for Vicky as everything she done was so patient centred.  \r\nThe day after the section I had asked Sister France if it was possible for me to go home. After speaking with the midwife looking after me that day, Catriona, she made sure that everything was checked and put into place so I could go home that evening. Both were so efficient and really listened to what I wanted and made sure it was possible given that baby and I were healthy enough.  \r\nGiven that my stay in hospital was short, I have to say that my care was nothing short of amazing. The video shared before we left made my husband and I both feel more at ease as we had something to refer to if we were unsure about anything - it is such a great new tool for new mums! It was really clear to me that the management in 2 West has done an amazing job and as a result the whole ward is so patient centred and works as one big team. I do wish my experience with my previous birth a couple of years ago was as good as this recent one, but I am so glad that this is the care that women will receive from now on. It really is a credit to all of the staff in Delivery, theatre and 2 West.  \r\nThank-you!!","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-04-03T19:59:59.7866667","progress":"Story has a
