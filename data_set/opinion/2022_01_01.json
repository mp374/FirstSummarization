A decision was made by my daughter and as a family the most appropriate route to take was a medical abortion. The support and care we received from our GP, BPAS call handler, and South Eastern HSC Trust was above and beyond. When it feels like your world is crashing down around you, it was a relief to know we had these services in Northern Ireland and didn’t have the added stress of having to travel to England.  \r\nThe aftercare from South Eastern HSC Trust was excellent. When worried the procedure may have not have been going as planned, a text messaging service was available to get in contact and they were very quick to respond. The nurse may have got more than she bargained for with me, as mother I was not coping emotionally well with the situation and time was taken to talk to me and reassure me. I will be forever grateful for that conversation we had that day.  \r\nI hope these services continue in Northern Ireland and get the appropriate funding. Nobody takes these decisions lightly but when they do, they should be able to avail of these services here.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-12-29T14:13:11.8866667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-01-01T09:01:33.2","readBy":[{"name":"South Eastern Health and Social Care Trust","count":5},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2022)","count":1},{"name":"Public Health Agency","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/905484?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"905484"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/905484/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"905484"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/905484/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"905484"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/905484/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"905484"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt004?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"ZT004","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/abortion?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"abortion"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/above%20and%20beyond?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"above and beyond"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/aftercare?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"aftercare"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/excellent%20care?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"excellent care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gp?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"GP"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pregnancy?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"pregnancy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/responsive?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"responsive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"supported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/available%20services?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"available services"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/905796?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"905796"}]},{"id":906186,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Fantastic service all round","body":"I've happened to need to visit the GP a few times in December both for myself and my kids.

If needed, you can get a same day in person appointment with the same doctor. The receptionists are lovely and helpful on the phone and in person. The doctors and nurses I've seen always listen, empathise, answer all my questions and leave me feeling comfortable and looked after, with great advice / treatment. They're brilliant with my kids, every time. The referrals onto other services are always timely and reliable. The prescription service to deliver to the local pharmacy is brilliant. The surgery is always clean and feels very safe.\n\nA fantastic example of brilliant systems, processes and, most importantly, brilliant people in every case. \n\nThank you for being there when I needed you.

Thank you everyone at Sandwell, happy new year to all staff.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-01-01T07:26:06","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-01-01T12:04:04","readBy":[{"name":"Sandwell and West Birmingham Hospitals NHS Trust","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/906193?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"906193"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/906193/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"906193"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/906193/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"906193"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/906193/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"906193"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rxk01?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"RXK01","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/looked%20after?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"looked after"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20good?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"not good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"amazing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happy?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"covid"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20happy?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"not happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/comfortable?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"comfortable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20happy?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"very happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%2019?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"covid 19"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20home?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"at home"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20looked%20after?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"not looked after"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/909366?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"909366"}]},{"id":906183,"author":"senga13","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"When i suffered a stroke","body":"I had a stroke in December 2019  \r\nI went to my GP and he confirmed it was a stroke and telephoned the Queen Elizabeth hospital.

I thank the dept. for the service I received.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2021-12-31T23:07:57","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-01-01T17:06:34","readBy":[{"name":"The Dudley Group NHS Foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/906215?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"906215"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/906215/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"906215"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/906215/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"906215"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/906215/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"906215"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rna01?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"RNA01","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"blood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ecg?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"ECG"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/909432?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"909432"}]},{"id":906220,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Wonderful Ambulance Crew","body":"I caught Coronavirus over Christmas and had to call for an Ambulance on 30th December.

She stated she will pass on a message. No one has called me the following day as I was unable to make the early morning call. I called again at 11am & I listened to a recording for 20 minutes saying I’m currently number one in the queue. This was so frustrating. Eventually some one answered & refused to tell me if a Dr was available.. Then the receptionist who took the call insisted I tell her all my details only to tell me the Dr has gone home. \nI’m disgusted with the the service at jubilee gardens, staff are never helpful, they’re dismissive & rude. They’re always late & it’s very uncomfortable speaking to receptionist who struggle to understand the basics. I also struggle to understand when staff speak to each other in their native tongue, this is unprofessional & offensive. Out of 20 times I call the surgery I have 20 issues. It’s outrageous & not good enough. The only time I get a call is after I write a review or make a complaint. No one calls regarding the concern i called about. \nNo consideration for vulnerable patients or patients less able to get to the surgery, receptionists who clearly have no empathy or compassion for people & an overall lack of concern for patients that are concerned for their well being, leaving patients feeling undervalued & a burden on the NHS. \nThis happens all to often & im appalled at the service jubilee gardens has to offer. \nSomething has to be done to stop this from happening. \nWhen I get a call about this review I’ll be promised for the 50th time that this won’t happen again. \n\n \n","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-01-01T00:21:17","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2022-01-01T17:07:25","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/906221?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"906221"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/906221/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"906221"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/906221/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"906221"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/906221/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"906221"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/e85745?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"E85745","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appalled?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"appalled"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/concern?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"concern"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disgusted?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"disgusted"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frustrating?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"frustrating"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20listened%20to?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"not listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/burden?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"burden"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/concerned?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"concerned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20good?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"not good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/uncomfortable?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"uncomfortable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20concerned?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"very concerned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vulnerable?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"vulnerable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20home?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"at home"}]},{"id":906227,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Semi prison","body":"Stay there for about 10 months, not allowed food when you want, kitchen got a thob key, only staff are allowed.

I really wanted a midwife-led birth and hoped to be able to use the birthing pools, so my first choice was AMH if they were available, and if they weren’t we knew we wanted to go to Inverurie. I still feel like I’m on such a high after having the most wonderful, positive experience at Inverurie.  \r\nI wasn’t sure if I was in active labour or not, having not experienced a spontaneous labour with my firstborn, so I went to Inverurie to be greeted by midwife Julie who made us feel so welcome. I expected to be sent home but I was 8cm dilated, so we were taken to one of the birthing rooms straight away where Julie let us both get comfortable. From there Julie encouraged me to follow my instincts and breathe through contractions as long as I could, provided a birthing ball and helped me move into different positions to help baby move down. She was so intuitive, friendly, involved me in all decisions and talked me through everything she was doing, and I felt so comfortable and safe in her presence. The atmosphere was so calm and peaceful, and I would never have believed I could be coached through labour and manage to deliver a baby with no intervention and using gas and air.  \r\nThe baby came quickly at the pushing stage and midwife, Jenni, joined us, and although things happened very quickly at that point, there was no panic, things remained so calm. He was delivered and passed to me while still attached to his cord and it was just a magical moment I’ll never forget. We did lots of skin to skin and managed to start breastfeeding before moving into the postnatal room. It was such a lovely place to recuperate and was again so peaceful, and it was so nice to have my husband able to spend as much time with us as possible. I was worried, with covid, that there would be more restrictions on that.  \r\nOur first postnatal midwife visits were from Sophie, who had been my antenatal midwife with my eldest, and it was so lovely to see a familiar, friendly face again. I found all the visits so thorough and reassuring. The midwives scheduled extra calls and even took a panicked call from us on Christmas Day, when we had concerns over our baby’s vomiting. Jenni extended our midwife care beyond the 10-day discharge which I really appreciated, and also referred us to the infant feeding team at AMH for additional support. Within 24 hours I’d had a video call and my baby’s feeding assessed. Karen was so helpful and gave me tips on ways to feed, to help alleviate my baby’s reflux symptoms. It’s a brilliant service which I’d recommend to any new parent who was concerned about feeding.  \r\nThe midwife unit at Inverurie is a fantastic facility with a truly wonderful, caring team of midwives. I hope I’ve not missed anyone out (I’m so sleep deprived and rubbish with names at the best of times!). I just want to say a huge thanks again to Julie and Jenni for looking after us during labour and to Sophie, Julie, Jenni and Lisa for their attentive visits in the days afterwards. And also thanks to the midwives and student midwives I saw during antenatal appointments, we think you are all amazing.","criticality":"not

Everything relating to the operation was handled exceptionally well by ENT and associated departments (e.g. regular cleaning out of ear in the ENT Department prior to the operation and discussions with the ENT consultant; arrangements for a CT Scan and Hearing Test, the pre-assessment process, the Covid swab test and communications about the actual processes at the Day Surgery Centre). I was contacted by the Day Surgery Centre on the day before the operation to check that I was ok and that I understood, for example, the starvation instructions that I needed to follow prior to the operation. What was particularly impressive was the fact that the person making the call put me at ease immediately by saying that there was nothing to worry about. This was important because, after having my covid swab test a few days earlier, when the phone rang I was concerned that it may be a call in relation to my covid test.\n\nOn the day of my operation, the procedures in the Day Surgery Centre were handled exceptionally well. The tests undertaken by the nurses, the discussions with the ENT surgeon and the Anaesthetist, the continuous checks to make sure that processes were being followed correctly and the discussions with the theatre staff on the way down to the operating theatre and the way that the anaesthetist and the team put me at ease as they administered the anaesthetic. \n\nAfter the operation, the staff in the recovery room were excellent with their caring nature that involved regular checks and conversations to ensure that everything was going well in terms of the recovery process. The ENT surgeon came to see me to let me know the outcome of the operation and what would happen going forward. The discharge nurse then took me to the recovery lounge, took my cannula out, continuously checked that I was ok and then contacted my relative to come and pick me up. I then left the Day Surgery Centre with all my discharge information including a letter from the ENT Surgeon which would also be sent to my GP.\n\nIn summary, I must say that the internal supply chain that supported me during the different stages of having my operation were excellent in every respect. I would like to sincerely thank all of the NHS staff involved in this process.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-01-01T19:01:41","progress":"Story has a

received a booster and also had a recent test proving no presence of the virus it is not acceptable, actually completely, wrong.\n\nIt is much more than bad and

Furthermore, even if you state the time, they'll disregard it anyway.\n\nWith the Bank Holiday being on Monday, that means I won't be able contact them until Tuesday.

And truly put me at ease , My consultant and his registrar went above and beyond their job roles and I'm so thankful for them the Odp who collected me was so kind , I don't remember the surgery due to being asleep but upon waking in the PACU unit I have the utmost respect for the amount of care and compassion and friendliness I received there ! Every nurse was brilliant and the doctor who had to check on me due to Nystagmus was wonderful I felt safe and at ease ( which is difficult due to working in the hospital I hate being there as a patient ) I then was admitted to the neurosurgical ward 2c where again my care was absolutely outstanding, due to the pressures they would have been short staffed but you would never had noticed , they were always checking on me  , I was even told off due to being too independent haha, I dealt with wonderful nurses , HCAs and a fantastic student nurse who the trust is lucky to have .. my blood pressure dropped in the night and they were constantly monitoring and giving me fluids , at the end I dealt with an physiotherapist, occupational therapist and some other specialists to ensure I was safe to go home and again they were wonderful , the only part of my care which I would say I didn't 100 percent agree with was once I was able to be discharged I was sent to the discharge lounge where it was absolutely full ! Like no chairs available so sat with 3 different people at a table and didn't feel very covid safe but again I understand sue to pressured and need of the beds .. despite this I would still hundred prevent recommend royal preston for care , and I'm so thankful for all the staff members I came in contact with , including cleaners ,porters ,chefs ,absolutely everyone.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-01-02T17:28:46","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-01-02T20:37:37","readBy":[{"name":"Lancashire Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust","count":2}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/906322?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"906322"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/906322/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"906322"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/906322/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"906322"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/906322/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"906322"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rxn02?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"RXN02","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disappointed?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"blood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20pressure?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"blood pressure"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/brilliant?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"brilliant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/face?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"face"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fluids?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"fluids"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lucky?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"lucky"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/neurology?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"neurology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pressured?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"pressured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/safe?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20lucky?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"very lucky"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"amazing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fantastic?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"fantastic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thankful?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Thankful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wonderful?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"wonderful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20disappointed?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"very disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20ease?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"at ease"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"put off"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"covid"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%2019?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"covid 19"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20home?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"at home"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/under%20pressure?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"under pressure"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/912274?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"912274"}]},{"id":906323,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Rude reception staff","body":"The reception staff is very rude.

I was reluctant and said no many times but I felt the staff pushed me until I said yes. I however mentioned I will not be able to wait for the results.  \r\nMy scan was done by a lovely staff member who was kind and explained everything while they were doing it, and they apologised when they had to press too hard.  \r\nThen came the other staff to perform their research bit. This member of staff did not explain what they were going to do and put a tight strap across my neck, I touched it to adjust so I could breath and they snapped at me to not touch it as it costs £20k. It was so awkward that I just laughed a little to make the situation normal but this member of staff told me not to laugh because it wasn't funny. I was so put off and upset and just wanted to end the whole thing then and there and walk off but I calmed myself down but their rude behaviour continued. My eyes were shut and the member of staff was scanning them and telling me to stop moving your eyes so much. How the hell do I have control over them when they are shut and you are pushing on my eyelids?  \r\nFurthermore, during the testing I was told a few times to hold my breath at almost 35 weeks pregnant!  \r\nIn the end I was told by the same rude staff that all my readings were high, my bp was high so chances are I will have the condition they were researching for which was quite shocking to me. They refused to give me a copy of my scan which I had to force them for because I needed it for my midwife appointment.  \r\nWe waited outside and the other staff came to give me my report and I asked them if my BP was high (all through my pregnancy my bp has been on the lower side) and they informed me it was normal!  \r\nIn my opinion the attitude of this staff member was rude and I felt like what I'd been misinformed, It made me feel awful and worried me for no reason. I am so upset and want never to see this staff member again. They also were wearing their mask on their chin when there were 4 people in a small room with me being vulnerable due to pregnancy.  \r\nI feel like they need training in how to talk to people and basic manners.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-12-31T17:57:03.4833333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-01-03T09:20:03.05","readBy":[{"name":"King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/906140?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"906140"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/906140/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"906140"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/906140/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"906140"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/906140/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"906140"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rjz01_501?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"RJZ01_501","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/birth?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"birth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pregnancy?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"pregnancy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pregnant?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"pregnant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pressured?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"pressured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/radiologist?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"radiologist"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scan?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attitude?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"staff attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/explanations?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"explanations"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/907840?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"907840"}]},{"id":906141,"author":"Hillside1","authorRoleId":4,"authorRole":"a relative","title":"Discharged home with lack of support","body":"A close relative was admitted to ward 102 after a fall at home via two amazing paramedics.

Upon entry to Ward 19, I felt the doctor who reviewed my son had no interest in my son or what my GP had referred us up for. They attempted to send us home without any support whatsoever. However, I advocated strongly for my son (which I shouldn't have to do) and was able to ensure he had blood tests done. His tests came back showing elevated levels of infection, which we were aware of from his severe tonsillitis. The doctor discharged us with no further support and my son still having a high temperature.  \r\nThe following day my son's condition had deteriorated and he was extremely lethargic, temperature above 40 degrees and he was in considerable pain. I took him back to ward 19 where the doctor admitted us to ward 20 and started IV antibiotics.  \r\nIV antibiotics are supposed to be given every 6 hours. However, they decided to ignore the 6 hour timescale and move his next dose to midnight, as this suited the routine on the ward. Midnight came and went and nobody appeared to administer my son's IV antibiotics that were already 3 hours late. My husband asked for somebody to administer his antibiotics at soon after this and nobody appeared until an hour later - now 4 hours past when his antibiotics were due.  \r\nAt this point, the nurse claimed that the cannula wasn't working and that a doctor would be required for them to proceed further. My son was not seen by a doctor until after 2 hours later, now 12 hours past his initial dose of IV antibiotics and 6 hours beyond when a dose was due.  \r\nThe doctor that we had initially seen in ward 19 on the first day attempted to place a cannula on a sleeping 3 year old, not once, not twice but four attempts, all of which failed. My son, as you can imagine, became incredibly distressed and at this stage my husband had to tell them to stop. He was given a dose of oral antibiotics and we were told they would be back in the morning and they would reassess for a cannula 4 hours after this.  \r\nThere was clear medical need for IV antibiotics, hence the admission and prescription being made. However, they decided not to proceed with an IV due to the fact that it had been 24 hours since his first dose.  \r\nI found this an absolutely shambolic and traumatising event for my son which seemed to place convenience for staff workload over the basic needs of their patients. I feel they jeopardised my son's health and safety and showed no regard for his mental health and wellbeing. This is a shocking state of affairs for any ward, never mind a paediatric ward where patients are unable to advocate for themselves.","criticality":"moderately
