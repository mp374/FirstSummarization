I was diagnosed with a rare condition in 2018 and still don't have a treatment plan. This rare condition means I am at high risk for blood clots. When I was diagnosed my case was taken over by the lead consultant of the clinic. This condition is usually secondary to an autoimmune or connective tissue disease but my consultant has only run standard blood tests and refuses to investigate further. Instead I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia, despite never been tested for that.  \r\nMy rheumatologist keeps asking about a symptom that I've never had but they seem convinced I should. Doesn't take notes during our appointments. Has repeatedly told me that I am not eligible for treatment because I'm able to look after myself.  \r\nIn 2018 my consultant mentioned a specialist in my condition in England but since then refuses to tell me who this specialist is or how I can get referred to them. I've stated that I would pay privately to see a specialist but they have subsequently said they don't know who the specialist is or if there even is one because the condition is rare.  \r\nI cannot work and live in pain every day and consistently have high levels of inflammation throughout my body. I dislocate several joints every year. While they have agreed in person that I likely had an overactive immune system attacking my body, it's been noted my condition is stable and I'd be reviewed in a year. I have multiple health conditions and attend other departments. My treatment in those departments has been stalled because my other consultants believe there is an overarching issue which needs to be addressed. I've exhausted every other option and all have pointed me back to rheumatology.  \r\nIn 2021 I asked for a second opinion and was told that there was no mechanism to do so as no one had ever requested one before with this consultant. It took several months and with help from the Patient Client Council, for the consultant to organise a MDM with other rheumatologists. I was only informed about the MDM after it had taken place and my rheumatologist presented my case to it. I had no confidence in my rheumatologist presenting the facts of my case since they have in the past consistently confused me with other patients. The result of the MDM was that there was no unifying diagnosis and I would be reviewed in a year.  \r\nI have had to ask my GP to refer me to another trust just to get a second opinion as I've been told it is not possible to see anyone else in his department. This means I'm now once again at the bottom of a waiting list.  \r\nI am a young woman and my life is on hold until I can be diagnosed. I have been told I cannot receive surgery for another condition until this rheumatological issue is diagnosed. I've also been told that the possible diagnoses could have an impact on fertility or pregnancy outcomes but nothing can be done while there is no definitive diagnosis. My entire life has become dependent on the 15 minutes I spent in one appointment. I don't know what to do anymore.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-02-24T23:00:10.7566667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-03-01T09:47:30.917","readBy":[{"name":"South Eastern Health and Social Care Trust","count":8},{"name":"Public Health Agency","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/919380?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"919380"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/919380/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"919380"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/919380/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"919380"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/919380/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"919380"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt004_07021-rheumatology?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"zt004_07021-Rheumatology","score":1},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disempowered?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"disempowered"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lack%20of%20care?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Lack of care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mistrust?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"mistrust"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20listened%20to?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"not listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/autoimmune?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"autoimmune"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20tests?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"blood tests"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diagnoses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Diagnoses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diagnosis?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"diagnosis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/listening?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"listening"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mistreated?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"mistreated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/rheumatology?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"rheumatology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/second%20opinion?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"second opinion"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/service%20pathways?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Service Pathways"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tests?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"tests"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/transparency?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Transparency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lack%20of%20treatment?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"lack of treatment"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/920666?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"920666"}]},{"id":919862,"author":"requirementre73","authorRoleId":8,"authorRole":"a staff member posting for a patient/service user","title":"My experience was first class","body":"I was admitted onto the Female Surgical Ward following severe abdominal pain.  \r\nMy experience began in the Emergency Department where I encountered a long wait.

I found it a real difficulty getting appointments for scans etc. as the booking system was quite inadequate in my opinion. For example, one of the difficulties I encountered was that I was told that there were no appointments available but was then subsequently contacted and asked why I missed the appointment. Clearly this issue with communication needs addressing. With this being my first child it made it quite confusing for me when it really should have been straightforward.  \r\nMoving to the delivery itself – it was very quick and I had no time for an epidural.

The 6th or 7th time I have been in the Altnagelvin Hospital in Derry, and I have never experienced anything like this. In fact, my experience has been so pleasant in the Fracture Clinic that I had with me today a card and a box of chocolate to thank the staff there - consultants and nurses alike - for their kindness and professionalism.  \r\nThe reason why I am writing today is because the recent consultation with the doctor was dismissive of the pain I had and the reason why I came, I personally found the language used to be abusive and described it as such, and critical of the diagnostic of other consultants and cynical in the way my questions were answered. As soon as I used that word, abusive, a nurse was asked to come to the room, and the doctor commented that it was them who feels abused by me. I left the appointment crying, and as I was sitting in the entrance of the hospital to look at the papers handed by the nurse who was in the room with us to complain if I wished to (they spoke to me right after I left the room), another nurse came to me, not knowing who I was, but as I explained what happened, they shared that another staff member who was in the room was also left shaken after this consultation. It is unacceptable to have a member of medical staff act in such a way. This is the reason why I am writing today.On to the story: I had a conversation previously on the phone over a month ago with the doctor. Already over the phone I had a feeling they were being a bit dismissive but didn't think much of it until I arrived at the hospital. There was the doctor and two additional members of staff as I arrived in the consultation room. I barely sat in the chair to speak about my problem when I was asked to see where it was hurting. The lump is on my left buttcheek.I was asked a few times to show exactly where the lump was and they pushed with a finger and it was painful. This was done a few times and I shared it was hurting here at this same place. They then asked one of the other staff members to also see and touch it too.As I sat down, he asked how big I thought this lump was - dating from 20 years ago- so I said it was perhaps the size of a golf ball, and that I wasn't sure. They started to read the report from previous doctors, making comments for each one of them in what I felt was a mocking tone. Said it was evaluated that the lump is 3 to 5 cm. I asked what that meant, and how big it was. They replied 3 to 5 cm, with additional comments.When the MRI scan was read - which was also read to me by the previous consultant who is the one who booked me an appointment with the surgical department - they said that they actually saw no lump whatsoever. There is no lump. And just kept repeating that when I was speaking of the pain and the fact that they had touched a point where I was hurt.The whole conversation then turned to an altercation where I felt ridiculed and that I had to justify myself for the pain I had, but also for asking, granted the fact that they see no lump then what then what to do?They continued to make dismissive remarks and this is when I actually said that I believe we didn't start this consultation from the right foot, that maybe it is because we have a different kind of humor but that I feel that some comments made were cynical and dismissive and quite frankly that it was abusive. The whole consultation was truly awful.This is when he asked the nurse to come in and I asked them to repeat the same things they had said before as the nurse was there. But obviously they didn't. I was made to read the MRI scan out loud to show that there is \"nothing there\" ( aka nothing threatening but still 3 x 5 cm lump is there). The doctor said I was just upset because they had said there is no lump. We ended this appointment with me being referred to another doctor because this doctor felt they couldn't continue the appointment with me. I had also asked to be referred to another doctor too. To be quite honest I felt even upset that the doctor saw my buttcheek so quickly - especially for pushing his finger to a spot that was painful and at the very beginning of our appointment to claim that they didn't see any lump. How is this possible?I respect highly any medical staff and always have. But this is truly unacceptable.  \r\n","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-02-17T12:06:48.3666667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-03-01T12:21:39.243","readBy":[{"name":"Western Health and Social Care Trust","count":20},{"name":"Ulster University, MBBS (Medicine) 2021","count":1},{"name":"Public Health Agency","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/917379?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"917379"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/917379/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"917379"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/917379/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"917379"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/917379/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"917379"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt005_45020_100?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"ZT005_45020_100","score":1},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt005_45020_130_10?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"ZT005_45020_130_10","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/clinic%20staff?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"clinic staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dismissive?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"dismissive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctor?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"doctor"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fracture%20clinic?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"fracture clinic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/language?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"language"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lump?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"lump"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mri%20scan?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"MRI scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurse?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"nurse"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain%20management?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"pain management"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/telephone%20manner?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"telephone manner"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20manner?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"staff manner"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/concerns%20dismissed?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"concerns dismissed"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/920338?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"920338"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/921799?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"921799"}]},{"id":919070,"author":"chachawg94","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Lack of equipment to help me live independently","body":"I am almost 80 years of age, live alone, and have no close relatives to help me, either physically or financially.

I have asked, under the freedom of information route, to be sent the local regulations which indicate the reasons why I cannot be given a stairlift. I have been informed by the OT department that I have enough rooms downstairs to convert them into a downstairs bathroom, a study and a bedroom and I should apply to the Housing Executive for a grant. I have in the past tried to avail of a grant to convert my bathroom upstairs into a shower room and been told that I cannot be given a grant because I did not currently meet the financial criteria. I have recently had to spend a considerable amount on house repairs therefore conversion of my downstairs rooms is not an option when a simple stairlift from the Trust would solve my problems. I am not dizzy so there is not a problem getting on and out of a stairlift chair to reach my bathroom.Government is keen that citizens can stay in their own homes, as opposed to being looked after in nursing homes, that they can get involved in community issues, and be independent. I also know of someone who was extremely wealthy, yet had been offered a stairlift. I have, and am still continuing to contribute to the local economy with payment of taxes. I worry that the issue of the stairs means that I may at some stage have a fall and die behind my front door. I asked my GP to intervene in my case which they kindly did, and have been informed that I should go through the Complaints process, years later!","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-02-23T19:20:41.8766667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-03-01T12:51:01.647","readBy":[{"name":"South Eastern Health and Social Care Trust","count":4}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/919070?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"919070"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/919070/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"919070"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/919070/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"919070"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/919070/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"919070"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt004-lisburn-ot?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"zt004-lisburn-ot","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disappointed?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/arthritis?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"arthritis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/service?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"service"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/inconsistent%20policy?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"inconsistent policy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lack%20of%20equipment?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"lack of equipment"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/920645?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"920645"}]},{"id":919693,"author":"Andy124","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Life-Changing Care","body":"  \r\n[Very happy with 'Cleanliness']  \r\n  \r\nI've just returned home from my second stay in Forth Valley Royal Hospital in four weeks.

After a day of little or no change, my GP arranged for me to be admitted to FVRH. I would like to thank Drs Roemmle and Boddington for their amazing support, both at this time and throughout my time with the practice. On both occassions, I was taken to hospital by a superb ambulance crew from SAS - apologies, I didn't note their names, but they were friendly, supportive, and made two stressful journeys very easy.On both occassions, I was admitted to the Acute Assessment Unit and thereafter to Ward B32. Without exception, every member of staff who looked after me was kind, personable, generous, supportive, and the very epitome of person-centred care. While I offer apologies for anyone I have missed, I would like to say a huge thank you to the following:AAUEilidh, Maria, Elizabeth, Chloe, James, Lynette, Jodie, and Nicola.I'd like to say a special thank you to Dagmara, who clearly spotted that I wasn't at my best and spent some time with me to lift my spirits (and shared a very meaningful quote with me). B32Betsy, you run a stellar ward! Bridget, Claire, Sarah, Trisha, Monika, Adele, Charlotte, Shirley, Kevin, Fiona, the amazing Dawn, Karen, Jodie, Jamie, Teighan, Heidi, Carol Anne, Nicole, Jeanette, Grant, Maddy, Petts - each and every one of you supported my through my recovery and helped me get back on track with good humour, kindness, and respect. Thank you all. I also wanted to say sorry to Tracy on ward B32 for scaring her in the night! The dose of steroids I'm currently on is wreaking havoc with my sleep, and when Tracy came round to do obs one night, I nearly jumped out of my skin, terrifying her! Sorry Tracy - hope things are a bit quieter now that you've got rid of me! :-)Finally, I wanted to say a massive thank you to Jane on ward B32. Jane absolutely went above and beyond to support me. Whether it was with a kind word, a joke, or time taken to patiently discuss my fears around cannulas and injections, The time Jane spent with me discussing my injection phobia was truly life changing. Jane always helped make a long day that little bit more enjoyable. Thank you for everything. Throughout my stay, the hospital was clean, the food was excellent (good veggie choices and the soup was superb - so much so if they release a recipe book, I'm buying!) - top marks to everyone involved. To everyone involved in my care, from my GP surgery, to the amazing crews from SAS, to the staff in AAU and B32 - thank you all for everything you did for me. Currently on the road to a good and sustainaned recovery - I couldn't have done it without you.  \r\n[Very happy with 'Food']  \r\n","criticality":"not

service user","title":"A long sleepless night in excruciating pain.","body":"I had been suffering from earache for a week and had been using drops for a week from pharmacy. I’m in the extremely clinically vulnerable group as I’m highly immunosuppressed.  \r\nI had just had my infusion that lowers my immune system and within 48 hours my earache felt like I was having a stroke. The pain is so severe I felt like I could pass out. My ear was hot, and wet and the pain was radiating down to my jaw and my neck. The skin in front of my ear on my cheek was completely numb and my head was about to explode. I’m always advised by my doctors that if I think I have an infection to get medical help right away after a history of sepsis and opportunistic infection.  \r\nHowever, if it's not my usual GP then I have to phone NHS 24 and OOH. I feel like it could be made less stressful and a lot quicker. Every time I call I just feel like I’d be better rolling up in a ball and quietly dying in the corner.  \r\nIt was Saturday and I knew this infection was bad (I have 30 years experience of this by the way!) So I called NHS 24 and waited about 40 mins on the line and got through to a nice call handler. They were efficient to be fair which was a first and delightful. They spoke to a clinician and they said an OOH GP would call me back within 4 hours maximum. 5 hours later, I’m now in excruciating pain as I no longer have any prescription co-codomol left in my cupboard. (Paracetamol for this type of pain is like taking smarties). I am now running a fever and crying. I call back NHS24 and wait another 40 mins on the phone.  \r\nBy the time the second call handler takes all my details and asks the same questions again I’ve now been waiting for a call back for 6 hours. At this time pharmacies were still open and a simple electronic prescription to one of them for antibiotics and co-codomol would have taken 5 mins and I would have been more comfortable and jobs a good ‘un. But no.  \r\nSo the second call handler talks to another clinician for a long time and comes back to me and said that because my symptoms had gotten worse we’re going to get a different clinician to call you back. In another 4 hours!! Yes thats right. I’d have to wait another 4 hours even though my symptoms were worse and I’d already been waiting 6 without a call back as advised. ‘Say what now??’ Another 4 hours?! To ‘maybe’ get called back. This is the service of an immunocompromised patient with a severe and rapidly developing infection.  \r\nI expressed my disbelief and the call handler went back to the clinician for another 10 mins while my eyes watered with the pain. They said that since I was not happy, they'd get someone to call me back within the hour. Oh I see, so it's my fault for being ‘unhappy’.  \r\nI finally did get a call from a very jovial doctor from OOH. No apology for not calling me back when they should have the first time. I confirmed my symptoms (for the 5th time) and said they’d send a prescription for antibiotics to Sainsburys pharmacy which is now closed so I’ll have to let the infection spread and be in pain until the morning. I asked them for a prescription of co-codomal as this is what I have been previously prescribed and they said that I could buy my own at Sainsbury’s the 8/500 strength. Charming. I thought in Scotland prescriptions were free?  \r\nI explained I normally get the stronger strength on prescription (they can easily check my records) and that I regularly take oxycodone for other pain but felt these were too strong to take for this type of pain. Still they refused. You see, when you have been chronically ill with many complications for 30 years like I have you get to know what painkillers work best with what type of pain. And the numb, earache and jaw pain radiating to my teeth and neck would have been made comfortable by 30/500 co-codomal. Not 8/500 in a patient who is opiate with experience. But what do I know? They said I could see how I go and can always call back. What?! Go through that ordeal and wait another 10 hours in pain while you call me back? Great advice. 5 stars.  \r\nI go now to enjoy a long sleepless night in excruciating pain.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-02-26T23:17:47.1433333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-03-01T12:56:28.7","readBy":[{"name":"NHS 24","count":23},{"name":"NHS Forth Valley","count":9},{"name":"Scottish Government","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/919761?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"919761"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/919761/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"919761"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/919761/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"919761"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/919761/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"919761"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/forth-valley-royal-gpooh?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"forth-valley-royal-gpooh","score":2},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/nhs24-111?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"NHS24-111","score":2},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/antibiotics?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"antibiotics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/call%20back?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"call back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/call%20handler?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"call handler"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ear?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"ear"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/earache?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"earache"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fever?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"fever"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/immunocompromised?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"immunocompromised"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/jaw?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"jaw"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/neck?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"neck"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/numb?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"numb"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/out%20of%20hours?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"out of hours"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/painkillers?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"painkillers"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/referral%20process?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"referral process"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sepsis?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"sepsis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/severe%20pain?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"severe pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/speed%20of%20process?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"speed of process"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/telephone%20assessment?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"telephone assessment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/speed%20of%20call%20back?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Speed of call back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wait%20for%20call%20back?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"wait for call back"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/920355?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"920355"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/920983?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"920983"}]},{"id":919738,"author":"importernc84","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"My Last Pregnancy & nurses quick thinking","body":"I came into maternity and delivery on Thursday morning to be induced for my third and final pregnancy, I was ever so slightly overdue – I think 40 +3 and my doctors advised me that this would be the best course of action. They also did not want to wait any longer as my previous babies had been rather large.  \r\nMy experience with this pregnancy has been fantastic – all the nurses and midwives on the ward are brilliant and almost know what you need before you realise it yourself.  \r\nThis is going to sound strange but having no visitors has been a huge bonus for me. My boys were born pre-Covid and having the constant stream of visitors was quite overwhelming. I also found it nice to have more time with my daughter and not having to share her with anyone else. I also feel that having no visitors has given me more time to establish that close bond with my daughter and get to know her little mannerisms, even if she is only two days old. I think having no visitors would be especially beneficial to first time mums for learning how to breastfeed as it is quite tricky and a daunting prospect, before you even consider the awkwardness of your partners mother walking in while you’re trying to give your baby the best possible opportunity and start in life as possible.  \r\nEveryone has been so amazing and I honestly couldn’t say anything bad about my experience. I had some issues post-birth with bleeding and needed rushed into emergency surgery, it was quite traumatic and honestly if it wasn’t for the nurses’ quick thinking and general skills in observing me I don’t think I would be here now. I lost about 2 litres of blood and had to have a blood transfusion – I feel great now because ordinarily I would be low on iron but with the transfusion, you honestly wouldn’t think I lost so much blood. The nurses have been really supportive since I was rushed to theatre and have been so attentive.  \r\nI am so thankful to the nurses for their quick thinking and attentiveness as without them we wouldn’t be leaving in one piece, well I suppose two pieces now.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-02-26T17:35:05.2433333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-03-01T12:59:13.64","readBy":[{"name":"Southern Health and Social Care Trust","count":6},{"name":"Public Health Agency","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/919738?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"919738"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/919738/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"919738"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/919738/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"919738"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/919738/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"919738"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_33020_501?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"ZT003_33020_501","score":5},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_33020_501-delivery?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"zt003_33020_501-delivery","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_33020_501-outpatients?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"zt003_33020_501-outpatients","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_33020_501-ward?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"zt003_33020_501-ward","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/approachable?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"approachable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/attentive?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"attentive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/birth?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"birth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bleeding?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"bleeding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20transfusion?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"blood transfusion"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/delivery?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"delivery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency%20surgery?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"emergency surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kind?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"kind"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/maternity?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"maternity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/midwives?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"midwives"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pregnancy?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"pregnancy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/relief?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"relief"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20for?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/quick%20thinking?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"quick thinking"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/attentiveness?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"attentiveness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/no%20visiting?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"no visiting"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/923745?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"923745"}]},{"id":919741,"author":"KittyM","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Homebirth and amazing midwives","body":"I had the most amazing team of homebirth midwives, who attended my home for all antenatal appointments. I felt that building a relationship with these midwives made me feel so much more relaxed and reassured about going into labour at home. They totally respected my wishes and birth plan, and supporting all the things that I had wanted for my first born baby.  \r\nI had everything planned and organised, down to the snacks we had in the house.  \r\nThings took a turn when I took covid a week before my due date, and was then told I would have to go to hospital, I believe this put my body under stress and it was just something that I hadn't wished for. When I started early labour and contractions started getting closer together which I contacted the Midwifey assessment unit, I was told that I would have to go into the hospital alone. Thankfully the homebirth team helped me in getting my husband into the delivery suite with me, as I was isolated anyway. The regulations within the hospital for having cold symptoms was absolutely ridiculous, however I did meet the most wonderful midwives in hospital who reassured me. I hadn't actually been in active labour and was sent home, and stayed in latent labour for another 24+ hours. I was able to have the homebirth team back on call as I was testing negative at home.  \r\nWhen I went into active labour I had the most wonderful midwife Andrea come out to our home, she was the most gentle, caring lady anyone could ask for and was just so reassuring and comforting the whole way through labour at home.  \r\nHowever I wasn't progressing anymore and I got my waters broke to find meconium. Therefore I was transferred to hospital via ambulance, where I spent the night still in very painful active labour and still not progressing. In the end I made the decision to have a C-Section and we finally got to meet our amazing, beautiful daughter. I am so grateful for the 2 lovely young midwives who looked after me during labour. However when I was transferred to the Midwifery Led Unit I was told my husband wouldn't be able to join me as I was still covid possible. I know this was no fault of any of the midwives working, but 100% down to the trust having ridiculous rules around covid. At a time when I needed my partner the most, to help support me and spend quality time with his daughter I was told I wasn't allowed it. In the end he got in for a short visit, but this totally made me an emotionally wreck and having a mini meltdown before I was able to see him. I felt so isolated and as if I was the plague when I was in MLU, all because I had a cold a week before, which I no longer had symptoms when I went into labour. Thankfully we got home a couple of days later, and we were back as a family unit and able to all heal together.  \r\nI am so thankful for the homebirth team and I cannot recommend them enough. Paula was just a lady to work with and made everything so smooth. I 100% plan on a homebirth for my next baby and hope that I get to work with all the amazing midwives again. I would love to see the homebirth team grow more and more, promoting natural and comfortable births for women within the Southern Trust!","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-02-26T17:41:38.9666667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-03-01T13:05:40.46","readBy":[{"name":"Southern Health and Social Care Trust","count":4}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/919741?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"919741"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/919741/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"919741"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/919741/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"919741"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/919741/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"919741"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_32024_501?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"ZT003_32024_501","score":5},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_32024-2-west?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"zt003_32024-2-west","score":2},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_32024-delivery-suite?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"zt003_32024-delivery-suite","score":5},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003-community-midwifery-dt?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"zt003-community-midwifery-dt","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scared?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"scared"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/antenatal?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"antenatal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/birth?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"birth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/comforted?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"comforted"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/comforting?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"comforting"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/contractions?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"contractions"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/c-section?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"c-section"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/delivery?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"delivery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/informed?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kind?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"kind"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/labour?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"labour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/midwives?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"midwives"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/section?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"section"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassuring?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"reassuring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"supported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"covid"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%2019?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"covid 19"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%20rules?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"covid rules"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/920328?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"920328"}]},{"id":919241,"author":"Elizabeth56","authorRoleId":1,"authorRole":"a carer","title":"My experience as carer for my adult son","body":"My son has been in the mental health system from teenage years. He is now 34. He has had several different anti-depressants and ect treatment twice. He has paid privately for trans cranial magnetic stimulation and other treatments like following an expensive ortho-molecular diet with consultation by private practitioners of this method. Nothing works. He is in a state of constant despair and has been hospitalised more times than I can remember. Every time there is a crisis eg self-harming I have to go through the very protracted system of ringing out of hours, who seem to know little about mental health, and they invariably refer him to casualty where he has waited up to 12 hours, climbing the wall in hysteria only to be referred to the mental health system he is already in. A fast track system is vital for suffering patients and carers like me who live in constant stress and do not need to be stressed by a health system. Recently he tried to harm himself in a way that meant protocol demanded out of hours GP got police involved. Whilst they were very good with my son they told me a great percentage of their time is taken up with similar cases. I don't feel that this is a good use of public resources as there were 6 police officers involved where possibly just one mental health crisis nurse was required. I feel that something needs to be done to rectify this model of reaching care as it does not currently work.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-02-24T14:49:13.5966667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-03-01T13:05:54.497","readBy":[{"name":"South Eastern Health and Social Care Trust","count":7},{"name":"Public Health Agency","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/919241?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"919241"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/919241/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"919241"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/919241/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"919241"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/919241/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"919241"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt004_14021_710?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"ZT004_14021_710","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt004-l-pyscology?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"ZT004-l-pyscology","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frustrated?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"frustrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/inefficient?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"inefficient"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/access%20to%20services?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"access to services"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anti%20depressants?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"anti depressants"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/despair?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"despair"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diet?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"diet"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ect?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"ECT"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/knowledge?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"knowledge"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/resources?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"resources"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health%20crisis?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"mental health crisis"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/920415?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"920415"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/920685?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"920685"}]},{"id":919815,"author":"moonmg95","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"My stay in the hospital","body":"On arrival, I was put at ease, taken to a consultation room where the process ahead of me was fully explained.  \r\nMet various members of the team to make sure I understood what was going to take place.  \r\nTaken to the anaesthesia room, rather nervous at this point, yet again, there was laughter and smiles all around. Definitely didn't want an epidural but nothing to it, the staff knew exactly what they were doing. I had sedation to help keep me calm. What seemed a short time I was in the recovery room where again the staff were amazing. I thought at some point I would get to a point whereby the staff would just treat me as a number, but there was no chance of that. I have never been to a hospital where there are so many kind-hearted and dedicated staff, where no matter what situation you found yourself in, any problems you were having with emotions, pain or simply not being able to reach your knickers, there was always a smiling face to help you.  \r\nNight time staff were just as approachable, press your buzzer and genuinely someone will be at your bedside to help you.  \r\nFrom cleaning staff(and yes the wards were immaculate) to theatre staff tthen onto the ward staff, I was looked after, I never felt I was being ignored, I have previously had treatment in a private care organisation but I can certainly say, the care at cannock hospital is second to none.  \r\nThank you to all the staff for making my stay as comfortable as possible. I have returned home with an aftercare package which was fully explained to me and even contact numbers should I need assistance.  \r\nOh and the food was just like perfectly home made food, all that is left to say is thank you to everyone, thankyou for looking after me.  \r\nOther hospitals please take note, this is the way to run a hospital, well done to everyone.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-02-27T10:22:17.77","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-03-01T13:26:26.443","readBy":[{"name":"The Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/919815?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"919815"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/919815/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"919815"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/919815/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"919815"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/919815/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"919815"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rl403_100?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"RL403_100","score":5},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rl403_144?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"RL403_144","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/aftercare?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"aftercare"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing%20care?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"amazing care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/epidural?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"epidural"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/face?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"face"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/night%20staff?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"night staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/person-centred?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"person-centred"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/recovery%20care?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"recovery care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sedation?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"sedation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ward%20staff?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"ward staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ward%20standards?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"ward standards"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/calm?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"calm"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20ease?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"at ease"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/theatre%20team?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"theatre team"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/922450?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"922450"}]},{"id":918204,"author":"Lets make a difference","authorRoleId":1,"authorRole":"a carer","title":"Lincoln County Hospital","body":"Mum had lung cancer and wasn’t at end of life care, as it was contained with immunotherapy. However, she started to show toxicity in November 2021. She attended the Oncology Unit for her treatment and collapsed there. At that point she was vomiting so much she was unable to keep food and drink down for 4 weeks. She struggled to attend to toilet needs and subsequently collapsed with severe dehydration. The nurses were brilliant but the doctors sent her back home again.  \r\nI received a call from a family member who was distressed as mum wasn’t coherent at home and hadn’t eaten for 6 weeks. I saw my mum and witnessed the state she was in. She had fluctuating capacity and when she did she said she couldn’t get to the upstairs toilet and had fallen and hit her head. She hadn’t released her bowels for a week and was peeing once a day when my dad tried to get her to the toilet. Her body was swelling up and when present, mum received a call from her oncologist, who was so rude to me I am appalled. They would speak to mum, who couldn’t get any words out by this stage. They said they will see her tomorrow and put the phone down. I rang Waddington Unit by this point and a fantastic member of staff said they needed mum in urgently, but they read back to me all the symptoms the unit knew about from 2 weeks prior to this, yet nothing was done.  \r\nMum was admitted and after a week, sent home with no care in place and the wrong medication. She couldn’t walk but didn’t even have a commode downstairs and the nurses that visited stated they didn’t know why they were there. Two days later she started vomiting again and we ended up back at the same place, this time within days. Again, we got her to hospital after a fight with the doctors who pushed for my dad to sign a DNR which he didn’t understand, as mum wasn’t at end of life cancer. He was so distressed. I turned up to the hospital in December and found the doctors had put mum into end of life care with not much discussion or anything with the family. By this point mum had given up mentally because of the treatment and she died 3 days later. The nursing staff were so short staffed, but were amazing and none of this is about them.  \r\nI made a formal complaint about the lack of mum’s care 3 weeks prior to her death as this could have been avoided, but I was told to get mum’s permission which was so rude and wrong when she was unconscious. Then I got told I had to go to her executer of her will which is actually not legally correct. Nobody would allow this complaint to go through because they wanted me to prove I was her daughter. What is this? I am a professional in a mental health trust, and nobody would have been treated like that. We treat ALL family and carers with the compassion and respect they deserve. This Trust didn’t do anything of the sort.  \r\n1: the lack of care given to mum when she collapsed was unprofessional, especially when my dad heard clearly that they weren’t helping her because of beds  \r\n2: the lack of respect and courtesy of the Oncologist, who was so rude and appalling, it seemed that her dying was just another one off their caseload  \r\n3: the lack of communication between departments, my poor dad received calls on mums phone after she died asking her to go for another Covid test before her next treatment. Nobody bothered to read her notes.  \r\n4: the disgusting treatment of myself as her daughter and carer by this hospital.  \r\nI am in conversation with the CQC about what has happened and will be seeking legal advice. I do not want anyone else to go through this. Covid is NOT an excuse.","criticality":"strongly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-02-20T19:46:34.4233333","progress":"Story has a

My experience begins when I and my partner were visiting some family members and he took ill. He was rushed to the emergency department in Craigavon and he was diagnosed with renal and heart failure. He spent time in ICU in Craigavon and the care he received was amazing, he was then transferred to male medical in Daisy Hill – this was a difficult adjustment for him as he had gone from one-to-one care in ICU to not having his own nurse, I understand that this is no fault of the hospital, it was just a shock to him. He was in a side room for a while, and he felt that he had been left there to die. I informed the nurses of this and they moved him so that he could be seen and not feel ignored. He then later had a jugular access port put in as an outpatient procedure and we were sent home with the instructions to head to Craigavon or phone 999 if there were any issues. Later that night I woke up and I was covered in his blood as the access port had leaked. We were rushed to CAH and he spent 15 hours in resus, after 8 hours they managed to get the bleeding under control and then they sutured the port in so it wouldn’t leak again. He never got what he ordered as he was on a low potassium diet, so I had to bring him in food to ensure he could eat without worrying if it could make his existing conditions worse. He was later discharged and now attends dialysis 3 times a week. This experience was very hard on me and it was a very anxious time for both of us, but any issues that arose were dealt with quickly and effectively and I commend the teams in Craigavon and Daisy Hill for that.  \r\nThen a few weeks ago I came into the emergency department with severe shortness of breath, I was in the department overnight while a bed was being organised for me up on the ward. I was well looked after in the department and saw several doctors, they suspected I had pneumonia and started me on antibiotics and other medications. There was a lovely nurse in the red resus who made me feel at ease and she actually came to visit me later on the ward, I really appreciated this gesture.  \r\nI was admitted to male medical, and I spent my first few hours in the coronary care unit before I was moved to a different ward. I unfortunately didn’t see a doctor until a few days later, when other patients had seen one. Over this time my breathlessness had gotten worse. I was then moved onto a cardioversion ward, and I was quite freaked out, I emailed colleagues and friends telling them I was scared I was going to die. After this occurred I received an apology from the nurse in charge and some of the doctors over how I had been treated.  \r\nI had gone for my first CT and I couldn’t actually get the CT done as when I lay down my breathlessness got worse, I felt that at the time the staff thought I was just hyperventilating due to the confined space. It was then discovered that I had a large amount of fluid in my lungs and this was likely the cause of my breathlessness. I then had a chest tube fitted. With the tube fitted I found my mobility greatly decreased as the drain itself was quite heavy, I then needed help to wash myself so I asked a Healthcare Assistant to help me, but they just brought me a cardboard bedpan and a cloth, left these on my table and then walked off. I was appalled that that was the level of care I received from her and I informed the nurses about this incident and it didn’t happen again. One of my friends came in to visit and helped me wash, that I would say was my breaking point. Later that day I heard the doctors talking about neoplastic syndrome on the phone and saw that there were tumour markers on my bloods form, that was when I knew something was really wrong.  \r\nThe doctors came and informed me that they had found cancerous cells in the pleural fluid they drained and that they were the cells of secondary metastases, I was then sent down to gynae in female surgical to have biopsies carried out. The nurse there was amazing and sat with me when I got the news. My nurse on the medical ward sat with me and cried when they found out about the cancer. My best friend informed my family and we all cried together.  \r\nI want to thank my doctors for the care and compassion they have treated me with, it is truly unbelievable, I’m grateful for them starting me on the cancer care pathway. The pharmacists and cleaners have been so kind (one cleaner left me up a tea cake after the incident with the bedpan). The nurse in charge is honestly fantastic, the epitome of what a nurse should be.  \r\nThe only things I think could be improved is that the nursing feels very task orientated and that I feel that it would be very beneficial to have a psychologist there when patients are given bad news for patients to talk to  \r\nIf you asked me a week ago what I thought, wouldn’t have been so positive but this last week has truly made me grateful for the staff here.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-02-27T15:11:45.0966667","progress":"Story has a

Often leaving me with insomnia, anxiety, depression and just feeling very confused, as it wasn't until recently that I opened up about what I was going through. I never knew that it was a tic, I just thought I was acting out weirdly and it made me so embarassed and ashamed for a long time. I often declined anything that required staying at another person's house or sharing a room due to this, which limited me a lot on experiences.  \r\nHowever, when I contacted my GP, I was referred to Inclusion Thurrock, and also Mind. I am known to them for having multiple different treatments, but I had never opened up about my true issue, I danced around what was really bothering me for a long time.  \r\nI recently suffered a trauma which left me experiencing the compulsion multiple times a night, which would progress into panic attacks and suicidal thoughts.  \r\nAbout 4 years ago, my previous boyfriend had taken his own life and blamed me for what he did. For someone who was already suffering with mental health issues, this was such a dark period of my life, my compulsion had never been worse as it had been the past 4 years, I felt like giving up, I couldn't share a bed with my partner anymore, if I did I was dangerous to sleep next to as I would hit out and jump, squeeze him really hard or shout really loudly. I didn't know how to explain my problem to anyone as I felt like it was so unique and unusual, nobody would know what to do to help me. Before giving up, I decided to approach my GP one more time and seek help.  \r\nThe process was brilliant, I was diagnosed with OCD within a few weeks which gave me clarity, it allowed me to be able to research the condition and find out how so many people related to the same problem I was having or similar.  \r\nI then had some group sessions online which were like an anonymous chat room, to prepare for CBT. Inclusion never left me waiting for a long time for any help, there were always options whilst I was waiting for my CBT to start. As well, Mind representatives called me weekly to see how I was doing, and to offer wellbeing experiences.  \r\nWhen I was paired with Louise for my CBT, I had already engaged in many other different sessions which had helped me prepare for CBT, so it wasn't so overwhelming. Louise was very patient, often our weekly sessions didn't relate at all to my original problem, she catered for what I had been going through that week and prioritised the immediate risks over the long term issues which I found very useful. However, I have also managed to reduce my compulsion a lot since our sessions, as well as recognising other behaviours and thoughts which were problematic, and managed to overcome some of those as well. Louise also sourced other helpful treatments for me which I am waiting for. I have felt so comfortable opening up to all the members of the Inclusion team, and I am so grateful for their support and professionalism. They always try to fit around my schedule even when I have last minute cancellations, they have never made me feel like a burden or an inconvenience. They treat you like an individual and always remember nice things about you to uplift you, it's very personal and empowering.","criticality":"not

It was so supportive to have speech therapy and physiotherapy to help get speech and movement improved, and so good of them to make all the visits in covid times.  \r\nThe help I received was immense and good to have any improvement measured from beginning to end. I cannot thank them all enough for what they did and I am extremely grateful for their efforts and kindness, particularly Alice for physio. It is a wonderful srevice that the stroke team give, thankyou so much.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-02-28T16:43:17.3133333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-03-01T16:07:53.637","readBy":[{"name":"Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/920070?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"920070"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/920070/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"920070"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/920070/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"920070"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/920070/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"920070"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rx1ra_300?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"RX1RA_300","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/contact?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"contact"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/help?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"help"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kind?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"kind"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supportive?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"supportive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vulnerable?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"vulnerable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/service?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"service"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/924736?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"924736"}]},{"id":920371,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Five Star care from all staff","body":"This is my first experience of undergoing surgery, so was very nervous.

The care and kindness were exceptional from everyone, greeted everywhere with a smile and kind efficiency, making a painful experience much more bearable.  Thank you to all.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-03-01T11:34:17","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-03-01T16:36:22","readBy":[{"name":"Royal Berkshire NHS Foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/920381?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"920381"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/920381/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"920381"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/920381/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"920381"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/920381/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"920381"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rhw?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"RHW","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/broken?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"broken"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/broken%20%20%20hip?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"broken   hip"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/broken%20hip?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"broken hip"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/broken%20shoulder?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"broken shoulder"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hip?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"hip"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/operation?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"operation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/physio?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"physio"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/shoulder?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"shoulder"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/920559?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"920559"}]},{"id":920113,"author":"Frankcb1","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"The staff were professional and polite","body":"Arrived at clinic in plenty time was booked in which took about 15 minutes.

And who can clearly access the internet and have no data problems and don't have to struggle with costs of PAYG phones. \n\nMy Nan cannot cope with this system. The GP knows this and would never have thought telephoning her this way for an appointment before covid. And in case they had missed that she is struggling badly with her health they have been automatically contacted by NHS 111, by ambulance services and by the various A&E's who have to keep attending because she is confused or fallen or her mental health has got worse.\n\nShe has tried calling but no GP has arranged to see her and they should have. In the past the GP held back appointments to be able to book in patients directly but we don't think this system is operating anymore. \n\nWe rang to try and get an appointment for a medication review but for some reason no appointments at all were available ( not even a couple of weeks ahead). And yes the receptionist was lovely. On that occasion we left our numbers as family for a call back from the duty doctor but no one called us . Instead they called our Nan who couldn't manage to get to the phone ( no message left but 1471 showed). Which demonstrates the problems people face.\n\nNone of us doubt that there are lovely receptionists and doctors. The problem is that far too many cannot access a telephone based appointment system and so never get to see the lovely doctor. There is clearly a divide and it feels that if you are the worried well of Kentish Town or just very assertive and techy you will get to see a GP. If you are severely disadvantaged in some way you won't.\n\nLet's also hope the new online system meant to be up and running but already unavailable is better than the previous one which is simply a very poor algorithm that barely includes the most common ailments . Anything that self care isn't appropriate for you are directed to phone the GP ! So, we hope that the new system will let us actually communicate with the GP directly and get our Nan the face to face appointment she needs. \n\nThe NHS is meant to be there for everyone on an equal footing. The lovely reviews are from those for who telephone and video systems work . My Nan is 83 and can't manage . \n\nMaybe the patient group who the website says meets with the practice can address this  as this has been her GP for decades? \n\n\n ","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-03-01T12:04:02","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-03-01T18:12:07","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/920427?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"920427"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/920427/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"920427"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/920427/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"920427"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/920427/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"920427"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/f83023?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"F83023","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confused?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"confused"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/worried?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"worried"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disability?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"disability"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/face?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"face"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/group?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"group"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/learning%20disability?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"learning disability"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/positive?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"positive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hope?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Hope"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/worse%20than%20before?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"worse than before"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20worried?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"not worried"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/no%20hope?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"no hope"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"covid"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%2019?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"covid 19"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/973266?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"973266"}]},{"id":920438,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"sneaky way of managing waiting lists","body":"I've been an in-patient and out-patient at Bassetlaw hospital, and have no complaints about the care I have received from wonderful medical staff.\nBut administratively they don't seem so caring (or maybe they are just in chaos).\nToday (26th January) I received a letter inviting me for an Xray requested by my GP.  That letter is dated 15th February and postmarked (second class) on the 24th February.

Of course a bit more notice (which would appear to have been available in view of the date of the letter) would have been welcome and increased my chances of getting to this appointment.\nBut this has been going on for a very long time !  In 2008 my wife got an appointment letter which was actually delivered _after_ the date of the appointment.  That letter had no postmark so we can't tell when it was posted, but the letter from the consultant (removing her from his list for missing the appointment) arrived fast enough !\nIt's time to take a good look at how they notify patients of appointments, I think.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-02-26T13:16:56","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2022-03-01T19:38:17","readBy":[{"name":"Doncaster and Bassetlaw Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust","count":2}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/920438?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"920438"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/920438/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"920438"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/920438/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"920438"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/920438/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"920438"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rp5ba?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"RP5BA","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20good?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"not good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/welcome?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"welcome"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/xray?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Xray"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wonderful?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"wonderful"}]},{"id":920440,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"The worst receptionist ","body":"The receptionist are rude, with an attitude, they don’t care about you, inhuman and unhelpful.
