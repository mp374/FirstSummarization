They are doing their best in what seems like a nightmarish system.\nAbsolutely zero consistency between reception staff - seems like only one staff member out of the entire reception team knows how to use computers and digital forms, making it extremely challenging to process things like blood forms, medicine requests, even phone appointments. I have been there in person before trying to sort out a digital problem that the practice asked me to sign up for, and have witnessed another staff member essentially shouting from the back office to the front reception with instructions for my receptionist on how to fix it.\nWas recommended to use a system called Systmonline for prescriptions then within about two months was told to use an app called Airmid instead (doesn't work, and I am very comfortable and familiar with how to use a smartphone). Then told to switch to Dr. Iq which does everything in its power possible to prevent you from booking an appointment for genuine reasons. \nAsked to change my personal details at the surgery due to change of name and contact details; given a wonky printout that looks like it was made in the 60s, didn't have half the details one would expect to be able to update in this day and age such as title. Receptionist was stressed and confused about this process.\nMy nhs records were updated but Dr Iq continued to have my old details. I addressed this multiple times with the staff but they have no idea how the app works. I uninstalled it because if I made any requests via the app, they continued to be listed under my old details therefore confusing the staff and inadvertently misgendering me when responding to them. The callback system linked with Dr Iq is awful.\nEvery phone call starts with nearly 2 minutes of my time wasted on a recording telling me to use this awful app.\nOn top of this, 9 times out of 10 when I phone up, I'm told to hold immediately which can be quite a shock - when I've visited in person I've witnessed the staff do this as well and it's obviously distressing the patient calling up from the other end of the conversation I notice. I have been inadvertently hung up on this way, and they never call you back - you have to sit through the same 2 minutes' recording then join the queue then they have no record of your conversation. Why not have a better call queue system?\nIt's pure chance whether you will have a text confirmation of an appointment or not.\nThis practice cannot be trusted to order a prescription for you what with the carnage of the staff trying to figure out how to use a digital system. I simply order via the dispensing pharmacy instead.\nI have had good treatment from the doctors and nurses here *once I can get through the battlefield of trying to book an appointment*.

But not any more. I lack trust in them now. After seeing a Paramedic person in May 2022 to be told she would refer me to physio, but she failed to do that. I had to chase it up in August 2022. I did get it referred immediately but that was due to my persistence. I had a telephone appointment with a Gp I needed to speak to them. I was told they would ring me sometime in the Afternoon.  I didn’t get to the phone in time. Had I have had a time slot like with a face to face appointment then I would have had the phone in my hand & been able to speak with him. I phoned back within minutes, I was told he would ring me back, but he never did. I visited the surgery as I needed a prescription from the Gp for my problem. I was told there was nothing they could do as I missed the call. Try iHeart Barnsley or visit the chemist. The chemist could give me a £18.00 solution for my problem, But I had to see the Gp to get the solution on prescription. I had no choice but to pay the £18.00 out as I needed the treatment. Something needs to change. I don’t mind having a telephone appointment, but I need a time slot please. Not sometime in the afternoon.  Also there are a lot Of new reception staff at this practice. They are nothing like the old staff. Why all of a sudden are the staff asking Why we need to see or speak to a Gp. That is my business. I feel that I am capable of ringing for a Gp appointment because I have something wrong with me, I am not ringing to waste the time of the Gp.   The appointment system needs to change with regards to the time slot. It cannot be an open time slot. If appointments can be sent from Barnsley Hospital with a time to ring them on then this practice can do The same. \nI have no faith in this practice any more. This practice has a lot of new medical staff too, some of whom are not actually Gp’s I fully understand that the medical practice is changing & there are new schemes being implemented, but the schemes need to actually work for it to be trusted & accepted as the normal way that the practice works","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-08-20T11:57:37","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-08-20T20:14:11","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/968338?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"968338"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/968338/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"968338"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/968338/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"968338"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/968338/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"968338"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/c85007?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"C85007","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/face?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"face"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hand?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"hand"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/normal?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"normal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/physio?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"physio"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waste%20of%20time?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"waste of time"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/capable?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"capable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/like%20myself?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"like myself"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/969539?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"969539"}]},{"id":968339,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Fantastic Clinic","body":"From the initial assessment to the removal of my cataract, I cannot thank the whole team the patient service was professional, friendly and totally committed to every patient nothing was too much trouble,Would highly recommend Spamedica.Thank you","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-08-20T17:33:11","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-08-20T20:14:28","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/968339?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"968339"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/968339/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"968339"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/968339/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"968339"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/968339/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"968339"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/o1p6x?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"O1P6X","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cataract?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"cataract"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/968843?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"968843"}]},{"id":968335,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Great hospital ","body":"Absolutely fantastic staff and hospital.

Please pass on my thanks to everyone in this department. \nThe NHS at its very best. \n","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-08-20T04:45:01","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-08-20T21:56:12","readBy":[{"name":"The Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/968355?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"968355"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/968355/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"968355"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/968355/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"968355"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/968355/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"968355"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rl403?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"RL403","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/colonoscopy?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"colonoscopy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/felt%20safe?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"felt safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/in%20safe%20hands?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"in safe hands"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/proud?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"proud"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/safe?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"amazing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20ease?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"at ease"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"put off"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20safe?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"very safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20at%20ease?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"not at ease"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/969631?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"969631"}]},{"id":968354,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"unbelievably long wait","body":"quiet a & e  only 2 patients waiting and no ambulances queuing but not seen in 1 1/2 hours and no apology.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-08-20T11:54:04","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-08-20T21:56:38","readBy":[{"name":"Stockport NHS Foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/968354?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"968354"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/968354/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"968354"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/968354/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"968354"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/968354/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"968354"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rwj09?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"RWJ09","score":null},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/971447?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"971447"}]},{"id":968358,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Good Practice but communication difficult ","body":"I have received good attention to date but getting through to the reception takes too long and communication problems are difficult to resolve as you have to find the time to wait around on the phone.\n\nI have a particular problem in that I have been asked to supply information via a reply within a secure messaging service but there is a notification saying I am unable to reply in the service itself which is completely unfriendly.

It was my very first time in hospital (and I am a woman of a certain age) I also had to go across to the pink rose suite for a procedure and that was easy too. I arrived at 7.30 am. I had my operation at 4pm. It was a long day. By the time I had the operation I was very hungry and thirsty.  No sooner was I back on the ward, there was a tray of toast and jam, a cup of coffee and jug of water. Very much appreciated. The aftercare was excellent. They sent me home with a smile and lovely words. It made me  feel cared for. They all do an sterling job and often go unappreciated.  Well not by me. Once again thank you to all the staff and nurses.

The outgoing message is over a minute long before you can speak to anyone, my own surgery answers my call in 20 seconds. Big difference.  In waiting for my previous calls to be answered, I've started at no.26 in queue, when I have reached no.1 I have then had the phone put down and then on the hook.  Today I gave up after 20 minutes, and then tried again only to wait on a different line for another 25 minutes.  It has happened numerous times.

Most of the smokers sat out side are on the only available hospital wheelchairs spitting all on the floors and chairs leaving no end amount of rubbish and never cleaning it up or even cleaning the chair at all whilst covid 19 is still in effect. A lot of the smokers out side the main entrances can be seen fighting with each other and being aggressive to all staff and security or general public. Taxi drivers parking and obstructing all cars parked in staff car parks and obstructing access for any ambulances trying to get into ambulance bays if any available not take up by either taxi’s or other car not being moved by security which is never around or can never be found if you do manage to find them they just say there’s nothing they can do about it at all. Half the time the can be found the other side of the hospital sat on the phones doing no work at all. If her majesty’s had to ever visit the hospital I believe she would absolutely mortified and disgusted with her visit!
