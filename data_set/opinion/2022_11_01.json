I’m sure they help lots of people but I encountered a very one size fits all approach that I found very frustrating and completely unsuitable for my own needs. I of course can’t speak for others and it is genuinely warming to see so many positive reviews here but if you have complex mental health needs, I would advise you to proceed with extreme caution at cgl Manchester. There used to be a thing here called the dual diagnosis service for such complex cases and sadly this no longer exists due to funding cuts which is a shame. Cgl are picking up the slack from that and whilst I don’t think it’s their fault as an organisation, my views remain strong; that cgl is largely unsuitable for anyone with complex mental health needs, prolonged mental illness and anyone of a neurodivergent disposition ","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-10-11T11:49:26","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-11-01T08:28:12","readBy":[{"name":"Change Grow Live","count":8},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2022)","count":3}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/992238?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"992238"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/992238/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"992238"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/992238/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"992238"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/992238/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"992238"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/nms-manchester?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"nms-manchester","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frustrated?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"frustrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frustrating?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"frustrating"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/access?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"access"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/autism%20awareness?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"autism awareness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/autistic?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"autistic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diagnosis?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"diagnosis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/echo?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"echo"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fits?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"fits"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20illness?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"mental illness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/positive?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"positive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/strong?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"strong"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dual%20diagnosis?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"dual diagnosis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/like%20myself?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"like myself"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/995634?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"995634"}]},{"id":992237,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"futile survey","body":"just been invited on phone to rate my experience yesterday on five point scale between very good and very poor.

I raised two complaints with PALS, the second one they haven’t even bothered to acknowledge. More worryingly, clues to my recent diagnosis were completely disregarded/ ignored at the A&E at this hospital in January this year. The cardiologist I spoke to basically confirmed this.  \r\nReading NICE guidelines, based on my symptoms, chances to identify my condition were missed completely and it’s only through my own doggedness and awareness through self research that I have now got some answers and basically pushed for tests and confirmed my own diagnosis with a rare condition. I feel that although the staff are lovely, this hospital is currently not fit for purpose, and poses quite a danger to its patients. I do not think it is a good time to be ill in Preston.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-10-29T03:15:24.24","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-11-01T09:23:18.937","readBy":[{"name":"Lancashire Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/991411?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"991411"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/991411/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"991411"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/991411/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"991411"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/991411/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"991411"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rxn02_320?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"RXN02_320","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cannot%20be%20bothered?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"cannot be bothered"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frustrated?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"frustrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ignored?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"ignored"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cardiology?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"cardiology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/complaints%20process?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"complaints process"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/heart?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"heart"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/missed%20diagnosis?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"missed diagnosis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pals?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"pals"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tests?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"tests"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting%20times?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"waiting times"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/secretaries?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"secretaries"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/999351?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"999351"}]},{"id":992243,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Very good service ","body":"I find the staff at the Booking Office at Preston very helpful.

By this time the hernias had definitely worsened and were causing severe discomfort.  \r\nThe staff at Stracathro could not have been more attentive, considerate and professional. I entered as a Day surgical case with the intention of being allowed home the same day upon certain conditions. During my stay all details were explained to me by the Surgeon, the Anesthetist, Nurses and all those associated with my care. Indeed I felt the care I received went above and beyond, nurses in particular going the extra mile to help me once the surgery had been completed. I did not know much about the surgery at the time as, of course, I was under a general anesthetic. Post surgey was not straightforward and there were some medical complications that could not have been dealt with better or more timeously. I got home on the evening of having fulfilled the conditions for release and I have to say that, despite no one wishing to go into Hospital, if I have to at a time in the future I would happily go back to Stracathro and place myself in the care of this dedicated group of staff at this NHS facility.  \r\nI cannot thank them enough. I am now a couple days past my surgical procedure and despite being sore and very tender I am mobile and moving around with an added element of care. I am no youngster any more, at the time of writing I am 70 years of age and I believe my recovery so far has been successful due to the care received during my stay. I am now looking forward to a long and healthy future and to once again undertake climbs of the Munros which had become a late in life addiction for me and one that gives me so much satisfaction.  \r\nTo all the staff at Stracathro I pass on my heartfelt thanks for the way you took me into your care, looked after me during and post the procedure and released me again to my very happy wife at the end of a difficult day.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-10-29T18:19:04.5","progress":"Story has a

I had spent a lifetime seeing Southmead and never wanted the transfer. I only wish I had not. My experience was one of absolute disbelief, staff that no longer acknowledged me when arriving for dialysis after I confronted the nurse in charge for accusing me of lying about a condition brought by a serious motorbike accident many years prior.  \r\nI felt alienated and that I was being lied to. Staff appeared to barely acknowedge me. It got that bad that I stopped attending my dialysis. I was transferred to Barnstaple. I arrived there and they had not even transferred my care, they knew nothing about me. My line is not working correct. My bloods are not good. Again, it seems, I was another patient who suffered the poor care and stigma of the staff.  \r\nI had a doctor make me feel like I was nothing - they indicated that they did do not see the issue with my kidneys as they had seen ones that were a lot bigger. Then they had the absolute nerve to call me \"hun\" after making me feel like I should not be there.  \r\nI have been left with the most horrid memories of a time that I would never repeat. I have cancelled the appointments made and I am due to return for a right nephrectomy next month. I would much rather take my chances. I have never felt so low, so belittled, completely in disbelief that the nurses attitude towards me was so poor come the end.  \r\nI do not believe the department had checked the machine used for the fistula check from the day I had it fitted, or had followed the correct protocol, knowing I was being discharged elsewhere. This experience has left me absolutely in fear of even opening up.  \r\nI left AMU on one occasion after hearing staff members laughing at a dementia patient. Being left for many hours without pain relief and feeling snapped at by a nurse and asked what I wanted them to do about it. Having to request that the staff wear their PPE when they approached me. Night staff where laughing, shouting and messing about until a male individual really shouted at them at 01:00. I am in utter turmoil by my experience and one that has left my health very very poor and they are supposed to be the best of the best.","criticality":"moderately

Dr Shepard is a lovely doctor and I genuinely felt at ease in her care. She took a genuine interest in relation to me being trans and the hrt impacting on my health but did not force me to make any decisions which was an extremely pleasant surprise. There's something a lot of other doctors can learn from Dr S.  \r\nI also had another lovely lady who remembered me from my VQ scan months ago. (sorry didn't get her name if she was doc or senior nurse or something) She apologised to me for not realising I was trans and if she had previously used wrong pronouns. Wow, I could have cried from happiness, small things like these mean so much to trans people especially in these trying times.  \r\nI hope all my future experiences are as pleasant as this time.

As I live 100 miles away I didn't think that I had much chance of getting seen but I got an appointment within 3 months and from my first assessment until my operation took only 3 months! I cannot praise highly enough the Walton Centre facility and the amazing Consultant, Doctors, Nurses, Radiologists, Physio, Occupational therapists, ancilliary staff, secretaries and receptionists, who made sure that I got the very best treatment. Nothing was too much trouble, if I rang up with queries or worries they were answered in a sympathetic manner. The operation was very successful and has changed my life by giving me back control in one hand. This means that I can now eat, drink and write unaided and have had my confidence restored to enable me to go out socially again. Communication by letter and phone calls is excellent and aftercare very thorough. All the staff I came across were friendly, caring, professional, supportive and accommodating. I feel so privileged to have been given this operation and I will  be eternally grateful to everyone at the Walton Centre Neurology Department for all they have done for me.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-10-31T12:02:16","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-11-01T10:30:19","readBy":[{"name":"The Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/992280?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"992280"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/992280/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"992280"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/992280/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"992280"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/992280/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"992280"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/ret20?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"RET20","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/aftercare?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"aftercare"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hand?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"hand"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/in%20control?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"in control"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/neurology?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"neurology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/operation?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"operation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/out%20of%20control?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"out of control"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/physio?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"physio"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tremor?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"tremor"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ultrasound?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"ultrasound"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"amazing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confidence?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"confidence"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20grateful?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"very grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/eternally%20grateful?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"eternally grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/no%20confidence?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"no confidence"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1000148?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1000148"}]},{"id":991670,"author":"Emmgh49","authorRoleId":8,"authorRole":"a staff member posting for a patient/service user","title":"The theatre team were great","body":"I have been on the ward for a week after I came in to receive an operation, the theatre team were great, and everything went as planned I was very nervous before but the staff on the ward helped keep me calm and were there for me.

She suffers from anxiety and decided to phone her midwife, who didn’t answer and then triage who said to call the GP, They told us to head to the hospital to have her heart checked without seeing her first  \r\nAfter a very long wait in the waiting room she was put in a ward where they checked her heart with heart monitors and had her hooked up to all kinds of machines. We waited a few more hours to be told she need a chest X-ray to check for a chest infection which came back negative and we were told we could leave when the doctor comes back.  \r\nThe doctor returned and said that she has to stay the night to be monitored for a blood clot and took her bloods, inserted an IV and injected her with a substance that was not explained or described to her and asked us to wait once again. After a further hour and a half of waiting she was hooked her up to a drip. When the drip finished we waited again and she was moved to a different ward where I was initially told I’d be able to stay with her overnight but was then told I couldn’t because she would be in a ward with other women. I was told to go home and leave her in a ward that in fact didn’t have any other woman - there was only one older lady and a few fully grown men who were dressed down in boxers.  \r\nAfter a long sleepless lonely night that consisted of many tests being done and many drugs put in her when she had no clue what they were and when she did manage to drift off for a hour and a half she was woken up to be injected with more unknown liquids and more tests. She was then told that she had to go for a CT scan and nobody can visit until after 1 o’clock.  \r\nAfter her scan they said that there will be a 1 hour max wait for the results and if all was well and the results were clear she would get to go home, when in fact we waited for over 7 hours just for the test to come back clear. and then had to wait another hour for a prescription for a urine infection, before finally being able to go home.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-10-29T20:21:57.5766667","progress":"Story has a

While waiting you can hear an audio message to schedule an appointment via the e-consult, that never seems to be having availability...The only way I can book an appt for my kids is via 111. Today, I was waiting for 1 and 40 my mind (being caller number 1 for the last hour) and then I hang up. I will change and move my family to a better practise.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-10-31T17:53:07","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2022-11-01T10:39:09","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/992287?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"992287"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/992287/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"992287"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/992287/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"992287"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/992287/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"992287"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/e86033?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"E86033","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/better?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"better"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/worse%20than%20before?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"worse than before"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/in%20the%20way?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"in the way"}]},{"id":992286,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Undecided","body":"I generally love this surgery, receptionists are always extremely helpful. However, the past 2 visits I have been left feeling like an inconvenience and upset and not being listened to. Both doctors talked over me trying to explain my history and symptoms, both doctors didn’t seem to have an understanding of my history or want to take on board the fact that I may know myself and my condition. Previously I’ve had exceptional service from doctors at this surgery so it was actually very damaging to my self confidence (I have to build myself up to leave the house let alone explain sensitive issues) and this has resulted in increased anxiety which will no doubt turn into the need for further appointments. I don’t want to change surgery but I feel like some of the doctors need a greater awareness of invisible conditions and the importance of not leaving the patient feeling belittled and frustrated by the lack of support. E.g. telling a patient that they “just have to get over it” or that they should “wait for therapy before doing anything”…waiting lists for therapy are approximately 24 months, when a patient is gradually getting worse and cannot leave home alone then there should at minimum be an exploration of treatments for the ongoing condition. I left the appointment feeling like I’d been spoken to like someone who didn’t understand anything when I actually have a deep understanding of my situation from a private and personal level. I hope things change back to the previous levels of service.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-10-31T17:59:11","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2022-11-01T10:44:02","readBy":[{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2022)","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/992286?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"992286"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/992286/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"992286"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/992286/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"992286"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/992286/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"992286"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/m82038002?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"M82038002","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frustrated?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"frustrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/inconvenience?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"inconvenience"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20listened%20to?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"not listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20frustrated?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"very frustrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20upset?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"very upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/alone?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"alone"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/belittled?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"belittled"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/invisible?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Invisible"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confidence?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"confidence"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hope?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Hope"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/like%20an%20inconvenience?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"like an inconvenience"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/worse%20than%20before?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"worse than before"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/no%20confidence?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"no confidence"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/no%20hope?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"no hope"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/listened%20to?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/like%20myself?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"like myself"}]},{"id":991708,"author":"Niamhh1","authorRoleId":8,"authorRole":"a staff member posting for a patient/service user","title":"The food isn't nice at all","body":"I came in this morning at 10am.

If this is due to a glitch in the system, I strongly encourage the practice to fix it asap; however if it is not a glitch, they should consider to stop accepting new patients, because they cannot provide a good enough service with the current numbers.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-10-31T19:25:10","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2022-11-01T10:50:46","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/992294?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"992294"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/992294/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"992294"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/992294/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"992294"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/992294/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"992294"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/k82065?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"K82065","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20good?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"not good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/like%20myself?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"like myself"}]},{"id":992293,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Flu Vaccination","body":"Quick, well delivered and organised vaccination at an ideal location.

In A&E I was basically told to go back to my GP, keep taking paracetamol (even though they had no affect) and that A&E weren’t there to deal with acute pain. They thought it was most likely a flare up of my endometriosis and they couldn’t refer to gynaecology, only a GP can. I had bloods done that showed my CRP levels were slightly raised..  \r\nI presented again yesterday due to severe pain, nausea, spiking a temperature, loss of appetite and as i’m unsure whether my IUD is still in place, 111 sent me to a&e. I have never being more disgusted about the so-called treatment I received.  \r\nFirstly I spent 4 hours in the waiting room to be triaged and sent to the Urgent Care Centre, only to be told to make an appointment with the GP as coil checks isn’t something they do. This was the second time I had been been fobbed off and I wanted to be seen by someone else. Secondly, I found the senior doctor to be one of the most arrogant and condescending I have ever come across. They agreed that my symptoms needed investigation but not via A&E as it wasn’t considered an emergency despite spiking a temperature, being in severe pain & losing my appetite as I have increased levels of nausea. When I pointed out that my CRP levels were still raising and were still elevated after 3 weeks, I was told I shouldn’t attempt to interpret the results of the CRP as only doctors can do that.  \r\nSo I have potentially a lost coil and signs of an infection but A&E don’t consider this an emergency nor will they investigate why I have an infection. I guess they’re waiting until I get seriously ill or develop sepsis.  \r\nI refuse to go back to Stepping Hill ever again and will be avoiding this hospital in future.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-10-30T09:35:24.3533333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-11-01T11:07:21.683","readBy":[{"name":"Stockport NHS Foundation Trust","count":1},{"name":"Ulster University, MBBS (Medicine) 2021","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/991647?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"991647"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/991647/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"991647"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/991647/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"991647"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/991647/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"991647"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rwj09_180?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"RWJ09_180","score":1},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disgusted?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"disgusted"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/abdominal?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"abdominal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/accident%20&%20emergency?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"accident & emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/coil?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"coil"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/endometriosis?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"endometriosis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fobbed%20off?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"fobbed off"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gynaecology?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"gynaecology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/in%20pain?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"in pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/infection?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"infection"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/long%20wait?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"long wait"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/loss%20of%20appetite?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"loss of appetite"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nausea?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"nausea"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/response?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"response"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/severe%20pain?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"severe pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attitude?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"staff attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/triage?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"triage"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/iud?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"iud"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/senior%20doctor?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"senior doctor"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/992778?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"992778"}]},{"id":991710,"author":"Niamhh1","authorRoleId":8,"authorRole":"a staff member posting for a patient/service user","title":"Food isn't hot enough","body":"I was in this morning at 8.40am and I have been coming to the unit since march time.

I’m lucky my wife was a mental health ambassador at her work and was very supportive of me. I had started to have some serious anger issues and almost like panic attacks at the thought of going out and mixing with people. I think if it wasn’t for work I would have hardly left the house.  \r\nI was put in touch with Sam the occupational therapist who listened to my issues and helped me find ways to deal. She suggested several different options, some of which worked for me and some didn’t. Everyone is different so it’s worth trying all options. I ended up finding some ways to help deal with the anger issues and on anti depressants which definitely helped me. With Sam's help I have started going out more and am finding it easier to mix socially. I used to be out every weekend before the covid years and that had tailed off to the point I was making excuses not to attend social events.  \r\nI have a daughter who has her own mental health issues and I know from her that trying to get access to a mental health professional through the NHS is almost a non starter at the moment so the service provided at my local doctors surgery was a major bonus. This service only being available locally to me at the moment, when Sam asked me if I was willing to write a brief review of my experience I agreed immediately.  \r\nThis service could potentially be a life saver and in my humble opinion should definitely be supported and funded further to enable expansion to other areas.","criticality":"not

I received excellent service from a very friendly and caring GP and could not have felt in better hands.  I received texts about appointments and was telephoned by the doctor the day after blood tests were done to give me the results which was very reassuring.  The doctor took the time to explain everything and recommended follow up tests to be on the safe side.  GPs and local surgeries take a lot of stick, particularly since things have changed after Covid, and I feel this is very unfair.  They are all doing their best with sparse resources and staff and I for one could not be happier with the service I receive from The Limes.  As others have said, the facility to request a call back when hanging on in a queue to make an appointment is very helpful.  The practice seem to be actively seeking out ways to improve things for patients, and the increased use of online systems and using texts to keep patients informed is very welcome.  I would comment that there do appear to be quite a few systems to keep on top of - that may overlap and confuse folk - including System Online, NHS App, NHS Covid App, SwiftqueueU and the Princess Alexandra Hospital website for booking blood tests.  It would also help if the latter two could flag up that you need a blood test paper form if you want to book for Waltham Abbey or Ongar, as they are not in the computer system.
