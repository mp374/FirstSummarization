Her behaviour and attitude reflects badly on this GP Surgery. She has somehow taken an instant dislike of me. I went in this morning (17th) and when she saw me she immediately turned her head away, said \"oh no,\" and whispered something to her colleague. I went to the window and after about 5 minutes of her ignoring me and staring into space, she reluctantly asked if she could help. My previous encounters with her had made me wary, so I told her, I would wait for the other Receptionist, who was on a phone call. She tried not to voice her displeasure or say anything inappropriate, but her body language, gestures and eye rolling let her down. I did not face her directly, but viewed her actions peripherally.  I dread going into the Surgery, in case she is on duty. Last week, I was actually standing by the window waiting and she called the man in the back of me. I objected and she sighed loudly and dealt with me first. She works in an environment where you have to be compassionate, empathic and sensitive when dealing with the public. I think she lacks people skills, which is blatantly evident. She needs more training in Customer care. I have not made a formal complaint or spoken to anyone at the Surgery about this issue.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-08-18T00:05:17","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-09-20T08:05:50","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/975101?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"975101"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/975101/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"975101"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/975101/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"975101"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/975101/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"975101"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/f85705?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"F85705","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/eye?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"eye"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/face?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"face"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/head?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"head"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/language?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"language"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wary?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"wary"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/986168?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"986168"}]},{"id":975116,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Anonymus","body":"I requested an emergency prescription.

However, this is the first time I encounter such NHS workers as Upper Tooting Road Medical Centre. When it comes to my health, I cannot remain silent. I called on Monday and asked for a visit, she asked me when I want and if the same day is suitable, I said that Tuesday is the best for me, she said that's great, I just need to call on Tuesday and they will give me an hour, I did so, but today I was told that the place is no longer available . (The conversation took place at 8:04 a.m.). When I said that I needed it as soon as possible because I no longer have the medicine that I take constantly, they found a place for me only on October 3rd.when I said that I was told to call the same day, she told me that there are no more places, I asked how come there are no more places in 4 minutes, she just tells me \"sorry\". This means I have to go private GP. I just don't understand why we pay for mandatory health insurance if services are not provided to me when they are vitally important to me? I wasn't even asked how long I've had the medicine for, or if it's been a long time since I've had it. Zero politeness, and I'm really considering moving my whole family to another one GP.  I just realized that the health of a person in GP means nothing. it's a pity that I had to choose this GP (to be more precise, I've never been to this GP, ) I wasn't even offered a doctor's consultation after re-appointment, even though they knew that I was constantly taking medication.

I had 2 lots of prescriptions lost, was then told one of the prescriptions was at the chemist, went to the chemist and it wasn't there. Went back to the doctor's who told me to get the chemist to phone them as they would no longer issue any more prescriptions, they didn't even try looking for the other one and that was it she just glared at me until I moved away. The chemist looked at me as if I was crazy but finally did call the doctors and managed after half an hour to sort the problem out. I finally got my prescription, if it wasn't for the chemist I'd still be pulling my hair out after 2 weeks of trying to get hold of my original prescription. The chemist informed me that the one and only prescription sent were sent today just after I went back down to the doctors to complain that I couldn't get my prescription so they hadn't sent it in the 1st place. As a disabled widow on pensions who has to rely on her car this has cost me a fortune in petrol, time, energy and pain. Where is the doctor could have given me a written prescription as I had a face-to-face doctors appointment anyway today on the 5th of sept. But as they had already lost my written prescription that someone had printed off for me on Friday but I physically and financially could not afford to go back to the doctor's yet again to pick it up, it had to wait until Monday when I was going to the doctor's anyway so when I went to the reception desk they said that they couldn't find it so that was the 3rd prescription that they had actually lost. This has never happened to this degree but it does actually happen on almost a buy monthly basis, that they will either lose prescriptions, forget to issue prescriptions and they won't let me go back to a paperbase prescription that I can keep an eye on. They're saying that they just don't do that anymore but they definitely should cause it worked fine for me before.

I will definitely change to a different GP. \nPlus noticed few times my kids conditions and doctor call backs were not noted on a system.\n","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-08-31T14:03:09","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2022-09-20T09:06:04","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/975156?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"975156"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/975156/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"975156"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/975156/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"975156"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/975156/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"975156"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l81077?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"L81077","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/allergy?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"allergy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/worse%20than%20before?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"worse than before"}]},{"id":974681,"author":"Niamhh1","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"more meal options","body":"The food is not great at all, I had problems with the food in Craigavon and it’s clear to see that there isn’t much difference here in lurgan.

They explained everything clearly and were happy to answer all of my many questions. They were warm and friendly and made me feel really at ease. They really were a lovely team. Thank you so much everyone for all your help and support today.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-09-14T16:54:40.15","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-09-20T09:12:22.367","readBy":[{"name":"United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust","count":6},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2022)","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/974676?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"974676"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/974676/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"974676"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/974676/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"974676"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/974676/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"974676"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rwdla_502?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"RWDLA_502","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bleed?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"bleed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/efficient?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"efficient"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hysteroscopy?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"hysteroscopy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/in%20good%20hands?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"in good hands"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/menopausal?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"menopausal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/parking?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"parking"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professional?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"professional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/receptionists?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"receptionists"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/safe?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ultrasound?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"ultrasound"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wait%20times?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"wait times"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/impressed?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"impressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/relaxed?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"relaxed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/explanations?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"explanations"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20at%20ease?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"put at ease"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/calm%20waiting%20areas?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"calm waiting areas"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/answer%20questions?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"answer questions"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/975634?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"975634"}]},{"id":975178,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Great Experience","body":"When I was struggling to find medical advice upon coming home from university for the holidays, Harvey Group Practice stepped up and immediately offered their services and signed me up as a temporary patient quickly and efficiently.
