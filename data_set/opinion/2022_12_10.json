The doctor who saw to me didn’t have any space left available and only worked a few days a week in the Surgery but she kindly saw me right at the end of her shift. Not only was she empathetic and kind, she was extremely helpful at explaining my blood results and helped me understand that I have Hypothyroidism. As someone who suffers with Anxiety she answered all of my questions without hesitation, she didn’t hide anything from me but she somehow made the experience less scary and definitely put my mind at ease. Not only did I feel like I got one hundred percent of her time and attention, she quickly got me the medication I required and made sure I left the Sugery happy with an understanding of what would come next. I came to write a review about the doctor but I can’t miss out the rest of the staff who were lovely too. The receptionist greeted me with a huge smile like she was happy to see me and the nurses who I have seen in the past have always been kind. I will be recommending Widcombe Surgery to anyone who asks!! Lovely atmosphere, kind and happy staff and very helpful…they help make the NHS look great!

After discussing  symptoms with Receptionist she got me the last one available to see Nurse Practitioner. I had walked down to surgery on off chance for advice. Despite them being very short staffed due to illness ( yes they are human) I was impressed  by the care I was given by Reception. The Nurse Practitioner saw me later that day and after examining me, taking history I was prescribed medication. I was so appreciative - and have a chance of feeling well for Christmas  now. I am on track for follow up if things don't improve. The  Pharmacy work v.hard in a small space- and obtained my medication for me. I have always found this Surgery to be there for me when I need medical help. I understand my part in the process though, and use their online system to order drugs ( in good time to recieve them ) manage symptoms myself ( before requesting  an appointment) and if it was necessary - go to A&E or a walk in centre. Their  online website information  gives good medical advice on simple ailments and what to do in an Emergency.  I feel as a Patient it is my responsibility to understand how the NHS can help me and what is my part in the process. I have witnessed awful behaviour in waiting room from patients towards Receptionists when their demands are unrealistic.\nStaff are doing their job and triage requests appropriately.

When I asked my son how he felt after seeing the GP his answer was “listened to” and “safe”. \nThank you ","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-12-10T10:38:32","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-12-10T19:25:44","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1006728?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1006728"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1006728/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1006728"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1006728/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1006728"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1006728/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1006728"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/p88008?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"P88008","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20listened%20to?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"not listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nausea?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"nausea"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/safe?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fantastic?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"fantastic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20safe?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"very safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/listened%20to?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"listened to"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1007787?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1007787"}]},{"id":1006727,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Excellent care ","body":"Needed an appointment urgently and receive one same day.

I've been at this surgery all my life and having to call at a specific time on the day along side the rest of the town is just ludicrous. You should be able to make appointments in advance at any time and they should be allocated according to seriousness and vulnerability. Most of the Dr's work part time / only 2 days a week.

They never offered me to do any tests, even didn’t bother to call me about my tests results (tests I asked myself). Eventually I became very depressed because of the pain I feel every day. But GP only told me: you probably have all these pains because of anxiety or depression. I was feeling so hopeless in this surgery so I would never recommend it to anyone!!!!!! My last visit with them was when I came to my GP office, politely asked her to do some tests as I don't want to live anymore and she didn't even care what I said. She was just looking at me like I would be a tree. After this consultation I was thinking about death because I was totally alone in all this pain, no doctor wanted to help me here.\nThank God I changed surgery and the doctors finally did some tests and gave me an answer - I have Lyme disease!!!

I have a family of doctors and can really sympathise but the way this hospital in particular is running with the increased amount of A&E patients is terrible. There needs to be a system in place to support each patient without having to make them wait A day to be seen. The doctors need to have a more clear list to follow and should have a rule of only pushing individuals at the back of the waiting list with only one person being placed in front and not multiple. I unfortunately lost count of how many were pushed in-front of me. Secondly, the Nmc of conduct states compassion and empathy, the majority of the staff in this hospital had shown 0 remorse for what was unfolding in front of them. And when anyone tried to approach the staff, that to politely, they kept ignoring and running into their private rooms. Very unprofessional. A review  of the hospital really needs to be put in place as I am shocked at what I witnessed today. I am shocked at the standards of practice.

The receptionist was amazing at changing an appointment for me to accommodate me and my circumstances. Lovely, friendly and very kind. \nI arrived for my first appointment just to have what I thought would be a routine eye test. But how wrong was I. My tests and consultation all sorted within less than 90 mins I had several eye checks, scans, spoke to the nurses and then the consultant, had a pre assessment done and was ready for my op in a couple of weeks time. Amazing service.  Quick, thorough and friendly. Everyone made me feel welcome and put me at ease. My consultant explained everything. Was informative, knowledgeable, reassuring and just super lovely. She made sure I knew exactly what to expect. \nThe nurses were fabulous and had a great sense of humour which helps when you’re feeling nervous. They put me at ease. Didn’t rush me and listened to what I was saying. \nOverall I would recommend everyone having eye issues to be referred to outpatients 10. Their service is impeccable! Thank you.

Despite it being busy on the Saturday morning, I was seen pretty quickly (and had the same experience again early on Monday morning).\n\nThe nurse I saw on Saturday morning was understanding and compassionate: they talked me through all of the various steps/ actions they were taken, including a potential referral to another hospital unit. They were kind and understanding, despite the potentially embarrassing nature of the incident.\n\nAfter the advice to return again after 48 hours, I was seen by a different nurse, but one who was equally caring and empathetic. Although the wound was healing well at this point, there was further reassurance and the opportunity to return in another 48 hours if required.\n\nYou could tell that the staff were working incredibly hard and we see in the media that A&E units are very busy, so I didn't really want to go after the accident. However, the care I received was exemplary and I am so grateful for the nurses that looked after me.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-12-10T13:23:59","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-12-10T20:18:10","readBy":[{"name":"Frimley Health NHS Foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1006746?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1006746"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1006746/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1006746"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1006746/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1006746"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1006746/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1006746"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rdu50?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"RDU50","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20cared%20for?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"not cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20about?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Cared about"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/looked%20after?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"looked after"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wound?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"wound"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20for?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20grateful?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"very grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doing%20well?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"doing well"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thanks?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"thanks"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/shaken?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"shaken"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20looked%20after?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"not looked after"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/like%20myself?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"like myself"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1009400?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1009400"}]},{"id":1006751,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"good doctors and nurses bad receptionists","body":"i have recently had to visit salters meadow a few times and had a few phone calls. having to deal with the receptionist is a real test of patients . being spoken down to and being dismissed is what you come to expect. on the last occasion i was waiting for a nurse to phone which did not happen and then received a text saying i had not turned up for my appointment. also i cannot understand why the receptionist want to know why i need to see a doctor and want me to tell them my ailment in front of people in a queue .

Rang back, waited an hour on hold, finally got my call answered and was given an appointment. A few days later someone from the surgery rang back and left me an answer phone message to cancel my appointment and asked me to ring the surgery back to book another!  \nAs if the cost of the phone calls wasn't enough in the first place I then ended up taking unpaid time off work and doing an hour round trip to visit the practice only to be told I could only get one if I rang in at 8 am the next day. I was then asked (in the very quiet waiting room) if I could tell them know exactly what the problem was and why I needed an appointment, this was in front of 3 people waiting (one of which had already contributed to my conversation about the wait as they had had a similar experience so they could obviously hear what I was saying). As this was very personal information I was not happy to provide this and politely declined. Eventually, I managed to persuade someone to allocate me an appointment and I was sent an appointment text message at 8 am the next day with a time of 14:55 for that day. Unfortunately, I had been up all night with a stomach bug so I was unable to attend so I tried to call the surgery again to cancel. I held for another hour on the phone and then gave up - my husband also tried for me later too and he waited for an hour on the phone and, like me, gave up too. We then found a form on the Larksfield website which I filled in to cancel instead. It was a good few hours before the appointment so plenty of notice given to allocate this appointment to someone else. I then received a text to say that I hadn't attended my appointment. Presumably, this will go on my notes and look bad when I rebook, if I ever manage to get another appointment, that is! :-(    \nVery odd that there are relatively few people waiting in the waiting room and no phones can be heard ringing in the background.

They were super prompt in finding me a bed in marsh ward. The midwives were lovely and got the induction process moving quickly. They discussed my options and I opted for the balloon . This has to remain for 24 hours before next assessment. I was given the option to go home for this time, or to stay in hospital. I chose to stay in hospital in case anything happened (I.e balloon coming out)  My partner was allowed to stay while I was there which was lovely. \nWhen I was ready for delivery, I was taken to the delivery suite where 2 (again lovely) midwives stayed with me the whole 9 hour labor, they monitored me and baby constantly and kept me informed as there were several potential complications they were keeping a close eye on. My natural birth turned into an emergency c-section due to further complications and the whole team were just amazingly quick to act and to deliver my baby as safely as possible. They kept me informed of everything happening. \nI was rushed into theatre within minutes of the decision being made where the surgical team were waiting and didn’t waste a single minute. My baby girl was safely delivered and I was sutured up within 20 minutes of entering. Absolutely incredible surgical team. \nI was then taken to iffley ward where I stayed for a further 2 nights. The midwives were incredible. There was one midwife in particular( I called her my angel )  who really looked after me, from helping me clean myself up changing my padded underwear. To realising I was shattered and taking my daughter away for a couple of hours to feed and look after so I could get some sleep. And just being super chatty and friendly.\nMy blood pressure etc was monitored regularly to make sure I was ok. \nMy daughter was monitored closely too.\nThey came to every alarm call, yes, you could be waiting a few minutes at a time, but these nurses were absolutely rushed off their feet . They were all working so hard. \nThe care I received from all the staff in all the departments of maternity was outstanding and although my birth plan didn’t go according to plan, they all played their part in making me feel safe, secure and making the experience as stress free as possible. I cannot thank the team enough. \nWe really need to protect our nhs workers. They have an extremely demanding job, and just work their butts off .

After 3 hours one of the consultants came out to the waiting room shouting that parents needed to stop asking reception and the initial assessment nursing staff how much longer they would be waiting. I think this needs to be addressed and the staff need to be mindful that these are very worried parents with seriously unwell children who are being made to wait fourteen hours, and maybe adjust attitudes / patient care a little.

December last.   After a ridiculous amount of time wasted in a telephone queue ( in excess of 30 waiters ), I chose to visit the surgery in my efforts to try and obtain an appointment.  After waiting in another line for more than 20 minutes, I finally got to speak to your receptionist, explaining that my visit was a last resort effort to speak to somebody.  I need a face-to-face appointment, as my medical predicament is not appropriate for a telephone consultation, but also, I am profoundly deaf, so such an appointment is clearly not suitable for me.   Your receptionist told me that there were no 'walk-in' appointments available for that day, and I would need to phone in, or visit at 08.00 hrs. to have a greater chance of sustaining such an appointment; - I explained that I had found this process unfruitful.  \n I was then told that there were no appointment slots available - with any doctor before Christmas - let alone my own, -  so I asked for one after the Xmas period.  Again, I was told that no appointment could be made for me at this time.  I took the only subsequent advice afforded me, and phoned the 111 emergency service, which I am pleased to say, did find me a time slot, that day, at another practice in Whitstable, where a Nurse Practitioner examined me physically, and prescribed medication. The Nurse told me that I should make an appointment with my own doctor within the next week, for \"A Review\" of my condition.  When I mentioned that I had found this difficult, I was told that I need to be assertive, and insist on seeing my Doctor personally.   Now, from my experiences detailed above, I very much doubt that this is going to prove possible, so perhaps you can understand my predicament here, and thus I must ask you for your advice and guidance on a suitable way forward for me. \nI trust you will agree that I have not been afforded a very good service on this occasion.

I've constantly been given the wrong advice by the reception staff and repeat prescriptions take over a week to process even though on the website they asks for 48 working hours notice.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-12-11T09:24:25","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-12-11T20:17:35","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1006931?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1006931"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1006931/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1006931"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1006931/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1006931"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1006931/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1006931"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/c82017?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"C82017","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/get%20fit?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"get fit"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1011856?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1011856"}]},{"id":1006930,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Wonderful Care","body":"Rang in the morning explaining how poorly I felt, had an in person appointment 2 hours later.\nAs usual treated with dignity, kindness and compassion.

The GP my daughter saw took a real interest in her concerns and after consulting with her about the next course of action has hopefully started the ball rolling on the best treatment for her going forward. My only issue, and hence not 5 stars, is that it took for me to get involved for her to have a face to face appointment, despite having tried herself on numerous occasions.
