Only a couple of their staff seem to be able to do their jobs and care. You get passed around a lot, and only get treatment if you keep begging.\n\nTook over 20 months to get treatment, which isn’t even a 1 on 1 psychology therapy, it’s an external service instead. They try to push you back to iTalk, irrespective of your illness.\n\nGroup therapy is a waste of time as the nurse can’t control the group and it’s left as a free for all. Nurses talk about their own problems and don’t listen or read your file before speaking to you, often triggering you. \n\nThe reception staff are either very rude or somewhat pleasant depending on who you get. They show zero compassion for the patients.\n\nThe wellness team just tell you to go for a walk, or treat you like a child, just awful. Only 2 staff seem to be passionate about helping their patients, the rest act like robots ticking off a list.\n\nThe psychiatrists are untouchable, only speak to them every 6 months if you’re lucky. Only 1 so far seems to have listened and shown compassion. The rest prejudge and just want you out of the room with your meds to fend for yourself.\n\nStaff love talking about themselves, and don’t actively listen. They seem to forget that mental illness needs compassion and active listening, not preconceived judgements and indifference. It’s very much a paint by numbers service there.\n\nIf you can afford it, go private as you’ll either get worse or get hospitalised before they treat you.\n\nI’d never recommend anyone using this service.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-05-19T06:33:47","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2022-05-20T07:19:13","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/940697?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"940697"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/940697/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"940697"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/940697/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"940697"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/940697/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"940697"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rw195?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"RW195","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20listened%20to?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"not listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/awful?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"awful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/group?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"group"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/group%20therapy?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"group therapy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/in%20control?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"in control"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lucky?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"lucky"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20illness?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"mental illness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/out%20of%20control?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"out of control"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/therapy%20group?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"therapy group"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20lucky?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"very lucky"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/worse%20than%20before?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"worse than before"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/listened%20to?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"listened to"}]},{"id":939838,"author":"SPr22","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Need information for my video consultation","body":"I have an appointment via a video consultation.

She explained as each part of the test went along, as did the very caring Dr Varda.

It used to be excellent. It no longer is.\n\nI suffer from anxiety issues and about a year ago my meds were changed when I was doing fine on the previous ones. The new meds were not working very well so about 6 months ago my dosage was increased. I was given a date for a follow up phone call to review how this was working. I took the day off. No one called. The new meds continue to function poorly, and seem to be causing bouts of depression as a side effect. Since many years ago I attempted to kill myself due to depression, this is potentially serious. After a particularly bad couple of days I called the surgery to explain that I was struggling with mental health issues. I was told that I would have to wait a month for a call back. When I pointed out that I never got the review call I waited in all day for, they said I would have to wait a month for that too. \n\nSo I attempted to do an e consult the following morning instead. The email I got back informed me that I would recieve a response by 6.30pm of the following day. So I spent two days anxiously awaiting a phone call which was only worsening my mental health. At 2.30pm of the second day, feeling increasingly depressed and low, I contacted NHS111. They called me back almost immediately and spoke to me and sent an email to my surgery expressing the importance of them arranging for a doctor to call me within two hours. They didn't. I chased up my surgery on the phone, and got told they'd had computer issues and to call back the following morning. No doctor from the surgery has called to speak to me. An email from an NHS111 nurse expressing the importance of this appears to have been blatantly ignored. \n\nI also asked if I could go back onto my old meds, a few of which I still have left, pending a new prescription. Obviously the receptionist could not authorise that but I have to wait until tomorrow before a doctor can be bothered to find the time.\n\nWhat is most unacceptable here, is that all this failure to get a problem addressed is actually worsening my condition, which fact the receptionist acknowledged. And far worse, the urgency the surgery was informed of by a qualified NHS111 nurse of a need to speak to me promptly was blatantly ignored.\n\nThis would never have happened in earlier years.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-05-19T18:38:23","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2022-05-20T08:56:49","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/940716?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"940716"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/940716/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"940716"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/940716/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"940716"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/940716/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"940716"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l83039?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"L83039","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ignored?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"ignored"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/depressed?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"depressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/depression?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"depression"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/failure?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"failure"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/informed?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unacceptable?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"unacceptable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/struggling?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"struggling"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doing%20well?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"doing well"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/worse%20than%20before?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"worse than before"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fine?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"fine"}]},{"id":937539,"author":"Cath1430","authorRoleId":4,"authorRole":"a relative","title":"Concerned about lack of care and communication","body":"Seriously concerned and saddened to see my wife in danger of not walking again, or being able to stand to turn without moving and handling equipment and carers rather than with me.  \r\nShe was admitted due to a hip fracture and on discharge from ward 6, I, as welfare guardian, was not informed of the pressure ulcers which had developed during the admission, and no request was forwarded to community nursing for follow up post discharge.  \r\nThe nasty ulcers (worst area predicted to be grade 3) have resulted in pain, discomfort and delays to recovery and rehab; 4 weeks post discharge and rehab is yet to commence at home.  \r\nI'm appalled and concerned about the communication and lack of care.

Thank you all.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-05-17T17:16:36.8566667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-05-20T10:28:54.553","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Borders","count":5},{"name":"Ulster University, MBBS (Medicine) 2021","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/939835?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"939835"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/939835/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"939835"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/939835/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"939835"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/939835/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"939835"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/b120h_501?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"B120H_501","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sb9-community-services-maternity?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"SB9-community-services-maternity","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good%20humour?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"good humour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ivf?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"IVF"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lucky?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"lucky"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/midwife?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"midwife"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/politeness?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"politeness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"amazing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/calm?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"calm"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"supported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20at%20ease?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"put at ease"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/941304?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"941304"}]},{"id":940728,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Reception was fantastic ","body":"My lady on reception is fantastic,\nSuper helpful and understanding,\nVery professional thankyou again keep up the good work x \nKerry Templeton x ","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-05-20T07:46:08","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-05-20T10:29:16","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/940728?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"940728"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/940728/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"940728"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/940728/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"940728"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/940728/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"940728"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/c84717?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"C84717","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20good?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"not good"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/950780?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"950780"}]},{"id":939939,"author":"Cloughreagh","authorRoleId":8,"authorRole":"a staff member posting for a patient/service user","title":"Cloughreagh House","body":"I came to Cloughreagh after being in hospital after a bad fall at home.

I frequently deal with staff at the practice on her behalf from organising appointments to prescriptions. The high level of professionalism and care never ceases to amaze me. The receptionists, assistant practice manager and prescription clerk, not to mention the GPS themselves, truly understand their patients and treat us like members of their own family. It is heart warming to hear them refer to you by your first name and show sincere interest in your wellbeing or to receive a phone call to remind us of medication reviews etc. I work within the healthcare system also and this means a lot as far too many times patients are treated as statistics and not individuals. Abbey Road surgery certainly aims to avoid this and for this, keep up the good work. Upon visiting the practice, I have heard one or two comments from patients about how long they've waited etc however, I would like to suggest not listening to such comments and look at the bigger scheme of the NHS. In comparison to other NHS departments, Abbey Road surgery does well in adhering to the individual needs of each patient. A humble thanks to the practice and assistant managers along with all other staff members for their hard work and dedication.

My GP referred me to the Haematology Clinic at Victoria Hospital, Kirkcaldy. An appointment was scheduled for October 2021. During waiting period I began to develop numbness/neuropathy in my lower legs. I told the haematology consultant about the problems I was having with dizziness, vertigo and neuropathy. The consultants opinion was that there was no connection to any blood disorder, and referred me back to my GP.  \r\nMy symptoms continued, and my GP could not determine the cause. Gabapentin was prescribed in November 2021. It was neither effective nor well tolerated, and the severity of the neuropathy progressed. In December 2021 I was prescribed Pregabalin, which was also neither effective nor well tolerated. Intermittent dizziness and vertigo, increasing leg numbness, and now chronic back pain caused considerable concern and mobility problems, and my GP referred me to the Neurology Clinic, Victoria Hospital, Kirkcaldy. An appointment was scheduled for March 2022.  \r\nI saw a neurology consultant and they asked me a few basic questions such as do you drink or smoke?. They didnt carry out a thorough lower limb neurological examination nor visually examine my legs, back, or gait etc, and did not advise any blood test, glucose tolerance test, or any of the other additional tests available for proper neuropathy diagnosis. The consultant told me they would refer me for an MRI. When I asked whether they thought my leg neuropathy or related to my back pain, They informed me that they did not have a clue. And that was that; very disappointing. I don’t think the ‘consultation’ lasted more than 10 minutes.  \r\nTo deal with the neuropathy and progressively severe back pain, my GP prescribed Co-codamol.  \r\nI had an MRI of the Lumbar Spine in April 2022, at Queen Margaret Hospital, Dunfermline.  \r\nIt is two months since my visit to the Neurology Clinic, and a month since the MRI. I tried to contact the neurology department on several occasions without success. Finally, a week ago, I did get through to my consultants secretary’s office. To cut a long story short, I was assured that an email would be sent to the consultant stressing the urgency of delivering their letter/report to me without further delay. A very brief letter from the consultant was received today. They have not presented any diagnosis, but has referred me to a neurosurgeon!  \r\nNow over 12 months has passed since I first consulted my GP with symptoms - which have progressively worsened. I am taking Co-codamol, and spending a good deal of time lying down, as the continuing numbness and pain often limits my mobility. Over the course of the past year I have discussed my condition with several GPs at my local practice and seen two consultants at Victoria hospital. No thorough clinical assessment nor neuropathy diagnostic tests have been carried out, to date.  \r\nI would have thought that accurate and timely diagnosis of any debilitating neuropathy is important to avoid progression of nerve injury and permanent nerve damage. Surely there must be someone within Fife NHS who possesses the necessary experience and skills to assess, recommend appropriate tests, and accurately diagnose my condition and advise a course of action. If so, who should I be seeing?","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-05-17T21:30:11.8133333","progress":"Story has a

severely sunburnt and struggling to walk. As soon as we came back, I rung 111 where they advised me to attend A&E. When attending A&E, I was greeted with an obnoxious receptionist who seemed to not care. After explaining that 111 advised me to attend A&E and that it was for sunburn. All the individuals behind the reception desk said we don’t treat sunburn, which fair enough I understand that they are doing their job and sunburn isn’t an emergency but I couldn’t walk and the blisters were leaking everywhere. I had to show them a photo of my legs for them to understand that it was a problem.  \r\nA&E waiting times were not too bad but once through into my own room. I waited 2 hours to be seen, with no instruction of what was going on. Anyway a doctor came through asked questions and then told me they need to do blood tests. They left and a nurse came in and put pressure on the blisters to pop them and then just wrapped my legs in bandages. That nurse said I’d have to keep going to my GP to get the bandages changed. However, when the doctor came back in the room with Eurax cream, he told me to take the bandages off after 12 hours and apply the cream and I’ll be fine by Sunday. It was currently Thursday.  \r\nOnce they all left the room, I didn’t know what was happening. Was I waiting for a blood test? Could I leave? It took 10 minutes for then another nurse to come in to ask if I had been discharged and then finding out for me that I had. At this point I had less mobility and more pain then I did when I came in to A&E and none of the wiser to what I was doing next. So much so, the next day I had to ring my GP to find out what to do and what was advised but to my surprise there was no record of me going to A&E until they got someone who could access some system to find out.  \r\nOverall, following the orders I had been given from A&E which turns out made it worse, I got admitted into hospital just over 24 hours later where they were surprised that A&E didn’t call up to them for a proper course of action originally.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-05-18T10:37:01.22","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-05-20T10:43:36.453","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":13}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/939962?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"939962"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/939962/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"939962"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/939962/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"939962"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/939962/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"939962"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/g107h_180?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"G107H_180","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/neglected?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"neglected"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/advice?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"advice"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/receptionist?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"receptionist"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/record%20keeping?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"record keeping"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attitude?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"staff attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassion?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"compassion"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/left%20in%20pain?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"left in pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sunburn?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"sunburn"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/942539?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"942539"}]},{"id":940732,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Outstanding service by Dr D Hogg","body":"I just wanted to thank the staff and Dr Hogg for the fast and efficient treatment I received this morning.

This makes it extremely easy to mimic the exercises, especially as it matters whether they are done right/left or clockwise/anti-clockwise. Rotating the video reduces the chance of doing the exercise the wrong way round. I suggest the physiotherapist advises patients to rotate the video in this way.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-05-20T10:43:53","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-05-20T11:02:22","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/940747?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"940747"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/940747/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"940747"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/940747/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"940747"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/940747/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"940747"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/k81014?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"K81014","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/exercise?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"exercise"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/947544?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"947544"}]},{"id":940746,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Always helpful","body":"I’ve had a couple of appointments in the last couple of months and on both occasions I’ve felt well looked after.

Could I deal with talking about things i knew would be difficult?  \r\nThere was a long waiting list, I was aware of this and of course Covid created even more delays. It did take a while ,mental health services are woefully understaffed in this and many other health care settings..  \r\nI was nervous that first day when I met my therapist, in fact I was shaking. As I now know I was overthinking it all! She was very easy to be with and made sure to explain how theses sessions would all go. so after that first session I went home thinking “yes I can do this”  \r\nThe sessions went on week after week, I did my homework and J continued with her guidance and revelations about myself . Life bulb moments as she called them and they truly were. I went into these sessions thinking nothing I say here in this room will make any sense, everything will be disjointed but how wrong I was. A pattern began to emerge which I never would have seen on my own and I could actually start to see why my behaviour is as it is. I was astonished to realise how far back this stemmed from and now it makes sense. I’ve learned so much about my thinking, my personality, my learned behaviour and much more.  \r\nMy therapy with J is just finished after quite an amount of months. I feel better about myself . j managed to give me confidence in myself, saw things in me I didn’t see. If you ever find yourself in this department wondering why on earth am I here, I don’t know what’s going on and a lady walks into the room with you saying her name is J and I will be your therapist Don’t worry, you are in the best and safest of hands who will expertly guide you through and even have a laugh or two with you on the way.","criticality":"minimally critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-05-18T14:41:05.7733333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-05-20T11:08:49.967","readBy":[{"name":"Western Health and Social Care Trust","count":9}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/940109?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"940109"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/940109/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"940109"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/940109/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"940109"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/940109/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"940109"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt005-psychological-therapies?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"zt005-psychological-therapies","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/long%20waiting%20list?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"long waiting list"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/psychological%20care?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"PSYCHOLOGICAL CARE"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sessions?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"sessions"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/therapist?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"therapist"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20confidence?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"given confidence"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/940762?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"940762"}]},{"id":940117,"author":"velafh68","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Encouraging wellbeing courses","body":"I've been attending the creative wellbeing course at recovery college.

In December last year I brought my mother to London from a care home which she hated and where her health deteriorated rapidly.   This practice took her on and has looked after her well until she died two days ago. She had multiple medical problems so sometimes I'd be contacting a doctor every few days.  But I was never made to feel that I was taking up their time and I always got a sympathetic response.  That was important because being a full-time carer takes its toll and you can become quite emotional if she's in distress or if someone is less than understanding.  The support I got was really needed and I very much appreciated it.  This morning I let the practice know that my mother had died through AskMyGP and within five minutes I had a lovely call from the surgery.   They've also just agreed to take on my husband who has a mobility disability and I'm so pleased.   \nThank you to all the staff who make it a place to be proud of.

The pain is chronic, but not incapacitating, so (although I would rather not have to) I've been able to just deal with it for some years.  \r\nI had my COVID booster early this year and almost immediately began to suffer from excruciating period-like cramps. In early March I came down with a very bad stomach bug which badly exacerbated my existing lower abdominal pain, so I went to the GP and asked for a scan to rule out anything more serious.  \r\nI was told that people are not referred for scans unless they've already been seen by a specialist and I can only see a specialist if the GP feels there's a need. The GP performed a standard check by pressing down on my abdomen, when asked if it hurt to touch I said no because it's not the outside part that hurts, it's the inside part that radiates pain to which ever part of me is facing the ground. If I'm standing, the pain will be around my pelvis and hips, if I'm lying down my lower back will hurt, on my side then it's my side that hurts etc.  \r\nAt this point, the GP told me there was nothing of concern there because it didn't hurt when she touched me and I was added to a waiting list and told that there was no way of knowing how long it would take for me to be seen.  \r\nOn the Friday, I began to notice a heavy, ball of pain on the right of my lower abdomen that felt like it was dragging down my right side, extended down my inner right thigh and putting painful pressure on my bladder/urethra. It wasn't excruciating, and from experience I knew that nothing would be done unless my life was obviously in danger, so I didn't bother to call the GP.  \r\nBy the Sunday, the pain had gotten much worse and I was becoming frightened. I called NHS24 and was asked why I didn't speak to my GP on Friday. After I explained and answered all the questions required of me, I was told to go take painkillers and use a hot water bottle. I told them I hadn't taken any painkillers that day because I've tried them in the past and they do nothing for my pain. They don't even touch it. The operator told me that if I wasn't trying to help myself, they wouldn't refer me to see anybody. I agreed to take painkillers and call back in a few hours.  \r\nWhen I called back and explained my situation again, the operator said that an out of hours team would call me back to let me know what the course of treatment would be.  \r\nWhen I received the call I was again asked to explain what my issue was and the operator asked me what I wanted them to do about it. I told them I was hoping they might be able to tell me what can be done and was told that they could only send me to an out of hours clinic where I'd have to explain everything to a different person, have my abdomen pressed and be told there was nothing of concern again. I said that wasn't going to help me in terms of pain, or in finding a solution to my problem, and was told that their only concern was keeping me stable until I could speak to a GP on Monday so I could ask them to bump me up on the waiting list. I was then offered painkillers, which I refused because painkillers do not help with these issues. Throughout the call the person referred to my pain as a sore tummy.  \r\nI called the GP on Monday morning. Different GP to the one I'd already spoken to, so I had to explain everything all over again. GP wanted to rule out a UTI, even though I suffer from recurrent UTI's so am familiar with the symptoms and am fairy certain this is not a UTI. I explained this but conceded that I understand these kind of things need to be ruled out. So she asked me to drop in a sample to get a dipstick test done. I wasn't able to that day because I was going to a funeral in England, so I asked if I could do it today instead. GP said that was no problem, she'd leave a sample bottle at the desk for me to collect and I could get it dipstick tested that day to confirm if it was an infection or not.  \r\nI was held up with work so called the medical practice to make sure that it would still be alright for me to come down this afternoon and was told that, although the lab pick-up was at 2pm, I could still go down and leave the sample to be collected tomorrow and have a dipstick test done.  \r\nWhen I got there I was told that the GP had printed a label for a dipstick bottle but put it on a lab bottle. They can't do dipstick tests on a lab bottle, or submit a lab bottle with a dipstick label on it and the GP didn't leave detailed enough instructions. So I need to go back again tomorrow, to be tested for a UTI that I definitely don't have. The receptionist couldn't tell me anything about my place on the waiting list.  \r\nI'm still in an ever-increasing amount of pain, frightened that it could be serious and at the mercy of of medical professionals who can't give me a good reason to believe that there's nothing to worry about.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-05-18T16:14:31.8033333","progress":"Story

After being asked to report to A and E for cardio admission, I was shocked to see so many sick and worried people left in chairs for so long. I was approx 15 hrs before being seen.  \r\nThe Integrated Assessment Centre ward (IAC) felt like a war zone. I was left by a bed at 4am and had to make it with sheets left at end of bed. I was not seen by any ward member until later. I was not sure to get in or onto the bed.  \r\nThe different types of needs from lots of patients was vast, and I saw many elderly people upset and crying.  \r\nI moved to cardio 2 days later and it was a blessing after what I witnessed.  \r\nEven the cleaning and support staff were amazing and caring. Only on this ward did I feel I was in care.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-05-18T15:14:22.9033333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-05-20T11:41:10.443","readBy":[{"name":"United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust","count":6}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/940122?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"940122"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/940122/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"940122"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/940122/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"940122"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/940122/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"940122"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rwdla_180?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"RWDLA_180","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rwdla_320?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"RWDLA_320","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/shocked?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"shocked"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing%20staff?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"amazing staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/assessment?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"assessment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breathless?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"breathless"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cardiologly?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"cardiologly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/caring?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"caring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/chest?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"chest"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/chest%20pains?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"chest pains"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/elderly?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"elderly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/heart?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"heart"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support%20staff?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"support staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"waiting"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/checks?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"checks"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cleaning?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"cleaning"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/a%20blessing?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"a blessing"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/941233?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"941233"}]},{"id":940144,"author":"greenbx44","authorRoleId":3,"authorRole":"a parent/guardian","title":"Excellent service and care from Forth Valley minor injuries","body":"I would just like to take the time to say how truly grateful I am for the speed and care that my 15 year old son received from Stirling minor injuries department.

They made me feel supported, cared for, listened to and helped me to progress with my many problems. I cannot thank them and the program enough. I miss them now that my involvement with CMP is over. Thankyou from the bottom of my heart.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-05-18T15:39:26.2933333","progress":"Story has a

I was not waiting and there was a doctor and all waiting for me as soon as I got out of the ambulance.  \r\nThe staff there are lovely and friendly. Overall, they are so efficient at what they do.  \r\nFemale surgical is great the food is brilliant, we had steak and I knew it was good since I could eat it and I do not have much teeth! I have received nothing but the best level of care.  \r\nThe staff are excellent, brilliant there is not enough words to describe them. I am being well informed by them and they ensure I know what they are talking about. The nurse last night- Fiona was lovely she had a lovely personality.  \r\nNothing to improve, this is a first class hospital.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-05-19T11:04:38.0366667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-05-20T12:30:48.157","readBy":[{"name":"Southern Health and Social Care Trust","count":3}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/940391?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"940391"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/940391/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"940391"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/940391/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"940391"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/940391/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"940391"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_33020_180?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"ZT003_33020_180","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_33020_502?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"ZT003_33020_502","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/a&e%20staff?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"A&E staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/first%20class%20care?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"first class care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/food?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"food"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/informed?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/looked%20after?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"looked after"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurse?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"nurse"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/well%20informed?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"well informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happy?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"happy"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/942191?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"942191"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/943438?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"943438"}]}]
