[{"id":921922,"author":"Joaglolo","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Not being listened to","body":"I was admitted to hospital with severe sudden neck pain and head pain. I was admitted to short stay in RVH. On admission and arriving it took approx 1 hour for any staff member to come near me. Staff were standing around chatting. Over the few days and on numerous occasions I pleaded with staff whilst in distress to listen to me and no one did. I was advised that the doctor had left for the day, or that they would need to call the on call doctor, or was asked whyI hadn't said things when then the doctor was there.  \r\nI was gradually getting worse and I was just given strong analgesia that made me sleep. On one particular day two days after my admission I cried and broke down to staff that something was not right. I was in extreme pain and again not being listened to. I pleaded whilst so distressed in pain to get a scan of my neck as the pain was so intense. I was given more analgesia and told the doctor will be around shortly.  \r\nI was getting numbness and weakness down one side of my body from my face to my arm and hand and a severe headache. The on call doctor said it was my cannula that has tissued. I knew this was not the case. I asked for more analgesia and was told by the nurse that I already had some an hour ago and wasn’t due until 10pm. Come 11:30pm and the nurse still has not returned.  \r\nThe next day I pleaded with the consultant to scan my neck before the discharged me. As I had already had a head scan he said I would be exposed to too much radiation and could not do scan and that I was ok to go home. Despite the neck pain and numbness/weakness down one side of my body.  \r\n6 days later I was readmitted to hospital and after another awful experience on a different ward I was given a diagnosis! A diagnosis that had I been listened too would have been picked up sooner.  \r\nI am a health care professional myself and I am shocked at how unprofessional some of the staff were and how I was made to feel like a hindrance!  \r\nA few staff of the staff were fantastic.  \r\n","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-03-08T01:54:52.95","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-03-10T09:19:33.19","readBy":[{"name":"Belfast Health and Social Care Trust","count":12}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/921922?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"921922"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/921922/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"921922"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/921922/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"921922"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/921922/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"921922"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt001_11021_400?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"ZT001_11021_400","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ignored?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"ignored"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20being%20listened%20to?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"not being listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/analgesia?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"analgesia"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cannula?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"cannula"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diagnosis?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"diagnosis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/neck%20pain?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"neck pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/numbness?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"numbness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/some%20staff?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"some staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unprofessional?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"unprofessional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/weakness?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"weakness"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/924953?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"924953"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/925901?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"925901"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/925924?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"925924"}]},{"id":922067,"author":"tauruswh45","authorRoleId":1,"authorRole":"a carer","title":"Went above and beyond to help my mum","body":"I just wanted to thank you for the help you gave to me and my mum recently.

I was sent for a Colposcopy. At the appointment Ellen and the two other staff members were so lovely; they were conversational and upbeat and really, really put me at ease. They explained the procedure beforehand and throughout and provided great aftercare information (both written and verbal).  \r\nIt turned out I had some pre cancerous cells in my Cervix and they carried out a 'Loop Excision Biopsy' to remove the cells and send off for a biopsy. Lots of hand squeezing was had during the procedure!  \r\nI will forever be so so grateful to Ellen and her team, for routine Smear tests and the NHS we are so blessed with in this country. I now feel I have a new lease of life and can live without fear. :-) :-)","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-03-08T10:39:22.4833333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-03-10T09:58:24.917","readBy":[{"name":"United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust","count":5},{"name":"Ulster University, MBBS (Medicine) 2021","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/922073?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"922073"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/922073/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"922073"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/922073/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"922073"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/922073/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"922073"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rwdda_502?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"RWDDA_502","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxious?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"anxious"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/aftercare?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"aftercare"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/all%20staff?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"all staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/biopsy?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"biopsy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/caring?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"caring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cervix?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"cervix"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/colposcopy?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"colposcopy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/comforted?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"comforted"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/comforting?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"comforting"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gynaecology?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"gynaecology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/informative?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"informative"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/informed?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/looked%20after?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"looked after"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/patient-centred?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"patient-centred"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/positive?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"positive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professional?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"professional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/quick?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"quick"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/smear%20test?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"smear test"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thorough?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"thorough"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20at%20ease?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"put at ease"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/924488?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"924488"}]},{"id":922078,"author":"mayzk79","authorRoleId":4,"authorRole":"a relative","title":"Big relief","body":"I wanted to give my opinion on the care package we receive for my husband as I think it has made an awful big difference for me.

This said I believe that 3 planned knee surgery cancellations is extreme.  \r\nIt began back in 2020 when I had my first pre-op assessment appointment date in March at University hospital Monklands, Rightly so given the circumstances back then my appointment was cancelled by telephone and I was informed they would be in touch ASAP with a re-scheduled appointment.  \r\nIn July 2021 I received a letter informing me I had now been passed to another surgeons list at Hairmyres hospital. Following on from that I received a call from the orthopaedic theatre scheduler offering me a surgery date at the end of July 2021. A letter was sent to me to confirm this and also a date for a pre-op assessment mid July, followed which I attended at Hairmyres Hospital. I also had an appointment at the Monklands hospital for a covid swab to be done and asked to isolate from then to my admission date. During my isolating period I received a call on from theOrthopaedic Theatre Scheduler cancelling my procedure and they would be in contact when another date became available.  \r\nIn August I received another call form Orthopaedic Theatre Scheduler to offer me a new date for surgery, which I again accepted. No pre-op assessment was required this time. I was sent a date for a Covid swab again at Monklands Hospital and begun my isolation period. Two days from my surgery date I was contacted again to cancel my operation as no non emergency surgical procedures were taking place due to Covid and that I would be contacted again when things changed.  \r\nMoving forward there had been no contact from the hospital of any updates, so I contacted the hospital myself in February 2022 and after a few phone calls the Orthopaedic Theatre Scheduler contacted me and informed me that surgical procedures were taking place again. I received another call on at the end of February 2022 offering me a surgery date of which I again accepted. I then received a call to change my admission time to 11am. Numerous appointments followed the next week:  \r\nTelephone Pre-op assessment 9.30am  \r\nBloods/swabs etc Hairmyres Hospital 11.00am  \r\nEcho Scan 10.30am surgeon clinic appointment 11.30am Hairmyres  \r\nCovid Swab Monkland hospital 2.20pm  \r\nFollowed isolating procedures ready for my surgery on the Monday  \r\nOn the day of my planned surgery at 9.20am I received a call from my surgeon to inform that my surgery was cancelled once again due to staff isolating.  \r\nNot only has this had a huge impact on my physical health but also my mental health each time preparing myself for surgery to be let down last minute.  \r\nThere has also been an impact on my work as I work in a childcare setting there has to be provisions made to allow me to leave to attend appointments etc, parents consultations cancelled and re-scheduled, outside agency meeting changed numerous times, There are some aspects of my role at present I cannot carry out, there are plans in place to support me with this also impacting on my close working colleagues.

It was the way they interacted with me that made all the difference.  \r\nAt every stage they informed me what they were doing, what was happening and when giving me pain killers to try to relocate my ankle, explained everything I may feel. Although in pain it helped keep me calm and totally believe that I was in such safe hands. Which I was. I think great care goes beyond just treating the problem but treating the person.  \r\nThank you to Martin and Paul for your marvellous care.  \r\nEqually the staff at Treliske were great.

An antidepressant and an antipsychotic. About 7 months ago they decided they were going to remove these tablets from my repeat without informing me. For a month the only way I could get my tablets was through 111 who treat you like you are a drug addict and make you out to be a liar because in no way could it have been the surgery's mistake. After over a month of sporadic tablets I became suicidal. I called the surgery and was seen the same day, but not by a doctor or nurse. I explained that my current mental state is due to my lack of tablets and was told that I need to work less and come back in 2 months if I feel the same. Again I was told that I couldn't have my tablets as they were not prescribed by that surgery, even though I had been getting them there for 2 years! Finally I managed to speak with a new doctor who was extremely helpful and over the next 5 months we both worked hard and managed to get me out of the situation I was in. I am finally able to get back to work full time only to go and pick up my prescription yesterday and be told that I couldn't have them as they were not prescribed by one of their GP's. After calling through about 50 times this morning I finally got through to the prescription line to be told that my tablet request was only put in yesterday so I need to wait for the doctor to review them. Complete and utter lies as it was put in a week ago, well within their 2 working day timescale. It is not right that people are this incompetent and lazy at their work when they are dealing with people lives. Getting my tablets on time may mean nothing to Conisbrough Group Practice but it does to me, which is why I make sure that I put my prescription request in with adequate time every month. Not that it makes a difference as they will just gaslight you into questioning your own sanity. You can only try and help yourself so much, and unfortunately I am in a position that I need help from a healthcare professional. Something which I have had to practically beg for and was only seen once I reached rock bottom, and not even by a doctor. And the receptionists are the ones that end up receiving the backlash from it because they are the ones on the front line so I think half the time they just don't answer the phone on purpose.

The nurse who cared for me on the ward, however, I felt was severely lacking. She did not know what surgery I was having and had to ask me, rather than look at the records. In my opinion there was absolutely no aftercare provided. This was not the nursing staff's fault. I feel there needs to be more staff to look after patients post surgery.  \r\nI arrived early in the morning and was only offered toast and coffee once post-surgery. No other food was offered or provided. I had to ask for water. Fortunately I was able to get up and around quicker than most of the other patients but those who could not, I felt were suffering.  \r\nI had planned to stay overnight, as I had no one to look after me at home, but, since I felt there was virtually no oversight or monitoring provided, I figured I would be better off on my own. I did have a friend agree to look after me at home, but she could not stay all night.  \r\nThe ward was clean, but it took hours for them to collect my gown and other items, they remained on the floor for the bulk of my stay. Throughout my stay, there were very few signs of nursing staff on our floor. One lady was sick and had to deal with it on her own. Another needed to get back in bed but was left upright for the entire day. Again, no food was offered, for most of us on the ward that day.  \r\nI know it is not the nursing staff's fault, they are expected to do too much and had no time. I think Tameside needs to provide more aftercare staff on that ward. It was appalling.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-03-08T10:50:34.2266667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-03-10T12:50:51.353","readBy":[{"name":"Tameside and Glossop Integrated Care NHS Foundation Trust","count":1},{"name":"Healthwatch Tameside","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/922077?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"922077"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/922077/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"922077"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/922077/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"922077"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/922077/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"922077"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rmp01_100?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"RMP01_100","score":3},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxious?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"anxious"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/neglected?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"neglected"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/aftercare?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"aftercare"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anaesthetist?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"anaesthetist"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/day%20surgery?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"day surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/food?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"food"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurse?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"nurse"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/planned%20stay?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"planned stay"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgeon?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"surgeon"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/theatre%20team?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"theatre team"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/923153?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"923153"}]},{"id":922771,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Poor listening ","body":"After 3 hours at an Urgent Care Treatment centre we were sent to A&E by the Dr. Triage nurse refused to take the urine sample we had managed to get while waiting.

The ambulance staff and the staff in the resus ward of A & E were all amazing. My mother was very seriously ill that morning with a possibility that she would die. Despite the pressures, the consultant in charge, Dr Martin, phoned me twice that morning, invited me to come up to see my mum and took time to speak to me in detail when I was there. My mother was admitted to Ward 5E later that day and I'm afraid that communication ever since has been far from great.  \r\nI was only allowed to visit twice per week due to covid restrictions. This left us heavily reliant on phone calls to the ward for updates. My mum was often ill, confused and unable to keep in touch with us herself. Even when she did, she was unable to relay what was happening medically.  \r\nMy experience at the outset was of daily efforts to ring the ward. The phone was rarely answered. On some occasions it was answered and the person immediately hung up before any discussion could take place. On other occasions the person I spoke to had scant knowledge of my mother and her care. An update was to say that she was in good form that morning and having a cup of tea. On other occasions, when the phone goes unanswered, I have been put through to the patient liaison service who also have tried the ward without success. They have then put through a request for a call back.  \r\nBoth my sister and I have spent whole days waiting for callbacks which never materialised. I only get a meaningful update when I complain to patient liaison and ask that they note my complaint on the referral going to the ward. That shouldn't be necessary. The quality and accuracy of the information provided varies considerably. I have raised that directly which resulted in a detailed call from my mother's consultant who was very thorough and helpful.  \r\nIn late February I was contacted to advise that in person visiting was suspended for 14 days as a patient who had been discharged had tested positive for covid. I was told in that phone call about virtual visiting and that I would get daily updates. That did not happened. I believe I had two unprompted updates in the last week.  \r\nIn February I was contacted by one of the doctors on the ward at my mum's request. I was told that there was a discharge plan in place which required a care package. There was a detailed discussion with the doctor around the various medical issues and needs. At the end of that phone call I was able to speak to the OT, who also was helpful.  \r\nSince then I have had no update about the care package, despite my mum telling every family member she speaks to that she is coming home tomorrow. We endlessly have to burst her bubble and tell her she isn't and that we have no information and no idea when anything will happen. I did receive an update at the end of February from the ward. I was again told there was no timescale for a care package. I asked for the name of the social worker who would be dealing with that, they were unable to give me that information. I managed to speak to the social worker eventually in early March to find out that my messages requesting a call from her had not been passed along from the ward to her.  \r\nI phoned again in early March looking for an update. I was told that the nurse was doing meds so was too busy to come to the phone. I have no issue with that given that I rang at 9.30 and I understand the ward is busy at that time. I was told my mum was in good form etc. I said I was not satisfied with that as an update, that I wished to speak to someone about the care package and about when restrictions on visiting would be lifted and wanted a call back from someone who could answer those questions. No one called. I have placed another call this morning and am waiting again. I literally have to take my phone with me to the toilet in case the hospital call, because if I am not able to answer, they neither leave a message nor call back.  \r\nThis is a difficult situation made even more so by the lack of communication and the often poor quality of it at. With one exception, I would say that the quality of information provided by the doctors has been excellent When visiting, the nursing assistants have been great.. Unfortunately that is not my experience with some of the qualified nurses.  \r\nWe have been living with Covid for two years. I cannot imagine why a ward which deals with elderly people has been unable to put in place procedures for keeping family properly informed, given that many patients are very poorly and very confused. I and my family are simply exhausted with the effort of chasing the hospital.  \r\nLast night my sister arrived for a visit at 6.00pm. She was met by a doctor explaining to our mother that they were moving her to Meadowlands in Musgrave Park Hopsital and were doing that right now. This was never raised as a possibility with us. It was not discussed with my mum , nor were we notified. I spoke to my mum later that evening, it was heartbreaking. She was confused, didn’t know where she was or why and was worried she would have nowhere to sleep the next day. This distress, upset and confusion were caused entirely by the appalling handling of this move. Had my sister not been there, we doubt that anyone would have informed us.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-03-08T14:19:34.6866667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-03-10T13:23:12.793","readBy":[{"name":"Belfast Health and Social Care Trust","count":7},{"name":"Public Health Agency","count":1},{"name":"Ulster University, MBBS (Medicine) 2021","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/922135?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"922135"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/922135/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"922135"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/922135/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"922135"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/922135/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"922135"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt001_11021_180?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"ZT001_11021_180","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt001_11021_430?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"ZT001_11021_430","score":3},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frustrated?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"frustrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/worried?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"worried"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/accident%20&%20emergency?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"accident & emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care%20package?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"care package"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/consultant?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"consultant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/elderly?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"elderly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/exhausted?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"exhausted"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/information?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"information"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lack%20of%20response?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"lack of response"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ot?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"OT"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/poor%20consultation?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"poor consultation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/quality%20of%20food?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"quality of food"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ambulance%20staff?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"ambulance staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/updates?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"updates"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/clear%20explanations?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"clear explanations"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/phone%20contact?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"phone contact"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unhappy%20and%20upset?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"unhappy and upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"covid"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lack%20of%20knowledge?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"lack of knowledge"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/924949?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"924949"}]},{"id":922147,"author":"lola2022","authorRoleId":4,"authorRole":"a relative","title":"Exceptional Nursing Care","body":"My father was a patient in Ward 3C for approximately 3 weeks and the care he received was truly amazing.

During this very difficult time the support we received as a family from the nurses and doctors was exceptional and we will forever be grateful for this.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-03-08T14:43:33.5333333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-03-10T13:27:53.277","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":10}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/922147?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"922147"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/922147/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"922147"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/922147/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"922147"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/922147/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"922147"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/g505h-elderly-medicine?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"g505h-elderly-medicine","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing%20care?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"amazing care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cheery?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"cheery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctors?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"doctors"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/domestic%20staff?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"domestic staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nursing%20care?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"nursing care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unwell?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"unwell"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/welcoming?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"welcoming"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassuring?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"reassuring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"supported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ancillary%20staff?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Ancillary staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kept%20updated?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"kept updated"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/923035?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"923035"}]},{"id":922166,"author":"volanszx74","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Impressive care","body":"I was called for a colonoscopy at Stafford Hospital following a per rectal bleed.

She was suffering from severe pain in her femur which she had had surgery on several months before and was unable to weight bear. We arrived at late morning, the department did looked fairly busy and at that point waiting times for Majors was 3hrs and Minors 2hrs.  \r\nMonklands is our local hospital but given my mum had a femoral nailing in Wishaw in September on the area where she was suffering the pain, we attended there because of the orthopaedic service. My mum was triaged after approximately an hour and was told by the nurse that she would have been better attending Monklands and if she needed orthopaedic intervention she could have been referred. The nurse then said she would see if someone from orthopaedics would see her.  \r\nAfter around 4 hrs of sitting in the waiting room, I asked reception staff if they had any idea as to how long we would have to wait to be seen by a Doctor and was abruptly told they couldn't give a time but there were 10 patients in front of her still to be seen.  \r\nAnother couple of hours passed and no orthopaedic Doctor appeared and she still waited to be seen by anyone. I asked on several occasions where my mum was in the queue and each time was never given a definite answer from the reception staff who in my view, overall weren't very pleasant.  \r\nAs we sat there that day I felt quite appalled at the overall treatment of patients. People sat in pain and although asked for pain relief, no one seemed to be in a hurry to help them, there was no communication with patients as to why they were waiting so long and the attitude of the reception staff was poor and they also spoke loudly and abrubtly for everyone in the waiting area to hear them. I felt the nurse who triaged my mum made no attempt to communicate what was happening with regards to the orthopaedic Doctor seeing her, also.  \r\nMy mum was eventually seen that night, nearly 10hrs after she arrived in the department. I understand that Accident and Emergency Departments are being stretched to their limits but how a 10hr wait can be seen to be acceptable, with zero communication or care given throughout this wait is appalling.  \r\n  \r\n","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-03-08T16:42:36.68","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-03-10T14:01:23.35","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lanarkshire","count":5},{"name":"Partnership for Change","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/922188?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"922188"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/922188/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"922188"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/922188/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"922188"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/922188/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"922188"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l308h_180?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"L308H_180","score":1},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/accident?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"accident"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/accident%20&%20emergency?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"accident & emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/orthopeadic?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"orthopeadic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attitude?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"staff attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting%20times?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"waiting times"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/923883?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"923883"}]},{"id":922790,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Terrible hospital ","body":"Waiting hour is approximately 4-5 hours in a&e.

I am still here as I write this and no surgical doctor has been to see me.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-03-08T23:33:35.94","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-03-10T14:19:49.68","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lothian","count":12},{"name":"Office of Foysol Choudhury, MSP for North Edinburgh, Leith, Edinburgh Western & West Lothian","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/922309?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"922309"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/922309/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"922309"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/922309/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"922309"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/922309/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"922309"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/s314h_180?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"S314H_180","score":1},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/neglected?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"neglected"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/abdominal?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"abdominal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"blood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20pressure?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"blood pressure"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain%20relief?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"pain relief"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unacceptable?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"unacceptable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unheard?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"unheard"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wait%20time?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"wait time"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/forgotten%20about?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"forgotten about"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/929093?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"929093"}]},{"id":922788,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Thank you so much for saving my life","body":"To ward 3 and A&E and to the CT scan unit.

In particular I'd like to highlight the genuine compassion and support given by both Joanne and Julie who looked after me on alternate shifts over my stay from Sunday until Tuesday.  \r\nMuch has been said about nursing staff over the last couple of years but I cannot speak highly enough of both these ladies and their commitment, humour and bedside manner were incredible. Overnight Julie endeavoured to complete her two hourly checks with the minimum of disruption and despite clearly being rushed off her feet was only too happy to stop, reassure and sometimes just chat to myself and others as if we were members of her friends or family rather than just patients.  \r\nJoanne had the misfortune to deal with a crisis in the shape of one of her patients testing positive for covid and having to follow strict protocols to move all of us to other rooms, quickly but sensitively and professionally. During this time it would have been easy for her to take her eye off the ball, focus on the covid issue and forget about the levels of care for us impacted by the move. Not a bit of it, clearly a stressful situation she handled it with consummate professionalism, organising new beds and cleaning of new rooms while still ensuring that all our needs were met and questions answered.  \r\nI don't know what these fantastic young ladies are paid but I can confirm that it's not enough. Crosshouse hospital and the NHS are lucky to have them.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-03-08T18:06:10.6333333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-03-10T14:38:36.193","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Ayrshire & Arran","count":5}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/922206?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"922206"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/922206/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"922206"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/922206/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"922206"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/922206/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"922206"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/a111h-stroke-care?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"A111H-Stroke-care","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bedside%20manner?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"bedside manner"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/commitment?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"commitment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/efficient?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"efficient"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/first%20class%20care?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"first class care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/human?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"human"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/humour?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"humour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/important?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"important"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurse%20attitude?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"nurse attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nursing%20staff?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"nursing staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professional?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"professional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/secure?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"secure"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sensitive?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Sensitive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stroke?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"stroke"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20for?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassion?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"compassion"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/valued?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"valued"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cares?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"cares"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%2019?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"covid 19"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good%20humoured?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"good humoured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20time?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"given time"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/924535?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"924535"}]},{"id":922794,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Lovely and caring nurses","body":"I've had two appointments with the nurses here and they have both been lovely and very reassuring.

There was also a tailored individual plan given .\r\nI had a detailed post course review and was referred to a respiratory nurse. I felt that at last my concerns re my asthma/COPD were both being taken seriously and followed up on. \r\nAll this is no small feat within the pandemic context, I am very grateful for an exemplary programme, which has helped me in a physical and educational sense.

The GP stated they did not have the readings so we then conducted a pointless review. The GP, yet another I have never met before, was polite and engaging. I later spoke to the surgery to ask why the readings I had supplied were not on my file and I was told they were and were available to the GP to review. I can only conclude that what to me was an important review was not taken seriously by the GP and what they stated masked their disinterest in my case. I did ask the receptionist to make a complaint but was told there was no process to do that. I later had another review by phone with yet another GP who had reviewed my data.

I also spent one night in ward 3E. I was in from Monday afternoon until Friday afternoon where it was repeatedly thought I had a bleed in my brain (at one point also a shadow and an infection). I am a mother to a young family and this came out of what I thought was routine and quick GP appointment.  \r\nI was amazed at the effort that all of the staff were making despite clear pressures. Their commitment to ascertaining what was wrong with me and unwillingness to take any risks or leave any stone unturned was fantastic. Everyone was incredibly kind including the doctors, registrar, consultant (who was able to tell me my own story back after four days in hospital), porters, nurses and auxiliary staff were excellent.  \r\nIn particular Rachel (doctor CAU) who tried to do my lumber puncture repeatedly despite my fainting and was constantly reassuring. She brought in support when required but stayed with me. Rachel checked on me personally at the very beginning of her shift the next day which I appreciated more than anything.  \r\nJoanne who was the nurse in 3E and went out of her way to check up one me (and get me ‘the good shower’ which was so appreciated) and always checked on all of her patients before taking her breaks. What a presence she has in the ward.  \r\nDr Ghosh (sp), the consultant who was so reassuringly able to tell me my whole four day story back to me without me saying anything. The reassurance of knowing the consultant I was speaking to at my near-discharge knew my whole story was fantastic. It saved me repeating the story and made me feel I had consistent care throughout.  \r\nGeorge - one of my many porters - kept my spirits up and wouldn’t have me walk an inch. One of many and I am sorry I can’t remember the names of the others.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-03-08T22:06:27.5333333","progress":"Story has a

I am severely hearing impaired, and cannot hear through face masks.  \r\nHence I wrote down a timeline and description of our child's symptoms to give to the medical personnel. I also wrote on the top of the sheet that I had prepared it as I am hearing impaired. I repeated this to the triage nurse verbally while handing over the paper. They barely glanced at it or heard me, and asked if I spoke English. I said it is my first language. They laughed and asked if it was just the accent then? I advised them that I was deaf.  \r\nThey said, with a wink, that they saw in the waiting room that \"someone\" was sitting on the chair whilst I was on the floor with the baby, and that next time I should tell \"someone\" to sit on the floor and to let me sit on the chair.  \r\nI believe they meant my husband. The waiting room was only half full and there were plenty of empty chairs. I was sitting on the floor as it was approximately 8:00 pm and past the child's bedtime, and child wanted to lie down on my lap, as they were also completely exhausted from the vomiting and diarrhoea. The waiting area chairs are quite narrow and you cannot sit comfortably cross legged on them holding a primary school aged child across your lap. I think they made the assumption that as we are Asian, my husband was being a chauvinist and not permitting his wife to sit on a chair. It's ridiculous. I told them straight away why I was sitting on the floor, and that my husband is not a patriarchal person (I'd be the the first to call him out if that were the case).  \r\nIt took us six hours to see a doctor. In my view, instead of wasting time trying to find oppressed women where there are none, it might be better if the staff directed their energies to provide proper healthcare.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-03-09T09:30:40.64","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-03-10T16:13:16.887","readBy":[{"name":"Belfast Health and Social Care Trust","count":13},{"name":"Ulster University, MBBS (Medicine) 2021","count":3},{"name":"Public Health Agency","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/922391?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"922391"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/922391/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"922391"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/922391/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"922391"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/922391/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"922391"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt001-ed?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"zt001-ed","score":1},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/deaf?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"deaf"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diarrhoea?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"diarrhoea"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency%20care?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"emergency care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hearing?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"hearing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/language?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"language"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/long%20wait?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"long wait"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/racism?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"racism"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attitude?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"staff attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/triage?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"triage"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vomiting?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"vomiting"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting%20area?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"waiting area"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/923096?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"923096"}]},{"id":922396,"author":"Chl1701","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"What a fantastic team!","body":"I recently was admitted through Day Surgery at Crosshouse Hospital, Kilmarnock for a hysterectomy.  \r\nI just wanted to say how amazing all the staff were that were involved in my care.

 \r\nTherapy is not for me, it's for other people. It's something we know about, and tgat's good for them. I'm different though, i can sort things out for myself thanks. I'm strong and not weak!!  \r\nWell that's how i roll , or at least that is still how i see myself.  \r\nI just wanted to give the feedback on here as i have in the last week completed the 'therapy' sessions so at least i can give you (anyone) like me, my honest opinion on getting in touch with Inclusion Thurrock.  \r\nThe past three years of my life got harder,darker and basically pointless.  \r\nGrief, Depression, Vile Employer, Better off dead!  \r\nThey were all my ingredients that led to my signing up to the \"Inclusion Thurrock\" therapy service.  \r\nCJ was my therapist, from the very offset , and i mean from the very first opening of the telephone conversation it was like talking eith a good friend.  \r\nI outlined basically what i thought it was going to be like doing this , and what i expected to get out of it all at the end of it.  \r\nThat was basically that i thought the therapist cannot fix it, that there is no magic band aid that can be applied and once taken off - you're all healed.  \r\nBut, what i was willing to do , was to give it a try..  \r\nThroughout those weeks CJ was fantastic, she did not judge and she did not lead me anywhere that i didn't want to go.  \r\nWhat she did do was \"Listen\" and \"Understand\"  \r\nThere was no pressure, and i had no dread in waiting for her call each week. Albeit i did not use this system as a comfort blanket, or indeed latch onto my therapist for longer and importantly for any longer than i needed as an individual.  \r\nBut, and this is the important part of why ive done this.  \r\nBefore you out there do anything that you might be facing or planning to do..  \r\nGet in touch with \"Inclusion Thurrock\" and at least try this. It really helps!  \r\nMy thanks to everyone at inclusion and my utmost thanks to CJ !","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-03-09T15:58:08.43","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-03-10T16:28:46.217","readBy":[{"name":"Midlands Partnership NHS Foundation Trust","count":6}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/922495?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"922495"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/922495/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"922495"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/922495/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"922495"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/922495/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"922495"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rrex4-inclusion-thurrock?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"rrex4-inclusion-thurrock","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/listened?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"listened"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/therapy?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"therapy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/understood?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"understood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/924908?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"924908"}]}]
