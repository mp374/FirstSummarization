Since joining this surgery and having my baby 6 months ago, I have had to get appointments for myself and baby for various things and I have to say everytime I have done so every doctor has been fantastic with such kind, caring and understanding natures. Even this evening at 6 o'clock I caught the on call doctor who allowed me to bring my baby for a late appointment and gave me the peace of mind that was needed without making me feel like I was wasting his time. Thank you Glenfield Surgery, we are so lucky to have the NHS but all of your GP practitioners are outstanding at their jobs and have been extremely accommodating.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-10-14T18:08:31","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-10-15T10:06:50","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/985967?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"985967"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/985967/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"985967"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/985967/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"985967"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/985967/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"985967"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/c82056?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"C82056","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lucky?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"lucky"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/peace%20of%20mind?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"peace of mind"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20lucky?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"very lucky"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fantastic?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"fantastic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/like%20myself?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"like myself"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/995506?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"995506"}]},{"id":985966,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Very efficient practice ","body":"I've never received anything but an efficient service from this practice and feel lucky to be registered with them.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-10-15T08:18:26","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-10-15T10:09:06","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/985966?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"985966"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/985966/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"985966"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/985966/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"985966"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/985966/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"985966"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/b84013?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"B84013","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lucky?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"lucky"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20lucky?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"very lucky"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/feel%20very%20lucky?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Feel very lucky"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/989588?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"989588"}]},{"id":985965,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Very good practice","body":"A very good and helpful service provided.

To add to this unpleasant experience the lady who answered the call decided to end our conversation with “oh shut up” and hang up the phone. I was informed by the new practice I’m the process of enrolling at, that no practice in the uk can take you off their patients list without a request from the new gp. So how did this happen?
