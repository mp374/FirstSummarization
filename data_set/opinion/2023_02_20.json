Incredibly unprofessional!!!","body":"Your reception staff are incredibly rude and generally not at all helpful. We were told by 111 we'd speak to a GP however all we got was an obnoxious receptionist speaking to a clinician. They attempted to fob us off and send us to the Bristol Childrens Hospital, despite this not being an emergency. Once we had finally argued our case to see a GP the following day (after turning up at 8am to ensure we got a same day appointment as you can never get through on the phone), we were vindicated by the GP informing us 'The emergency room would not have been appropriate'. We were told to collect a stool sample, handed the tubes by the reception team. However were not informed of sample drop times -' just drop it back to us at the end of the day'. We subsequently missed the collection (we attempted to drop it off at 17:15) and were subsequently told we'd have to take another the next day as collection was at 1645. This was for our 5 month old daughter experiencing gastro issues.

I saw a specialist nurse for my injuries. The nurse was kind, empathetic and explained how I could manage my  injuries and pain relief. We did not have to wait long to be seen from the time we arrived to going home. It all went smoothly and was very well coordinated.\nWe were then discharged home with follow up letters sent to our home and our GP practice and telephone calls followed from the consultant and physiotherapy service as scheduled.\n We have both made a very good recovery and feel we have been cared for very well.\n\nFrom  walking into A &E the care we have received by the staff has been exemplary and the service seamless from one department to another including all the staff who have attended to us along our recovery journey. We cannot thank the team who saw to us on the afternoon of 26th November ie the receptionists , Dr, Nurse and X-ray staff were brilliant including the follow  up care by the Consultant and physiotherapy team. I am only sorry we cannot name all the staff who were on duty that day  to give them our heartfelt thanks but I hope this review reaches them.\nThank you once again.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2023-01-19T15:47:08","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2023-02-20T06:35:47","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1032230?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1032230"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1032230/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1032230"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1032230/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1032230"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1032230/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1032230"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rgp75?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"RGP75","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20cared%20for?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"not cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20about?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Cared about"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/in%20pain?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"in pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20good?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"not good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain%20relief?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"pain relief"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/physiotherapy?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"physiotherapy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/relief?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"relief"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/shoulder?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"shoulder"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/triage?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"triage"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/well%20cared%20for?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"well cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/x-ray?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"X-ray"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20for?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hope?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Hope"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doing%20well?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"doing well"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thanks?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"thanks"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/no%20hope?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"no hope"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/injuries?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"injuries"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20well%20cared%20for?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"very well cared for"}]},{"id":1032241,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Great practice ","body":"I have had the misfortune since Xmas to need to call 3 times and every time I have called ( have had to wait a little while each morning between 5-15 mins but this is to be expected) the receptionists have been helpful and considerate ( I always explain my symptoms) .

4 for me. I had successfully breast fed my older two children but twins was much more challenging. I received support from Tricia when I was in hospital for the first week. She was absolutely incredible and I don't know how I would have managed that first week without her. She made sure I was sent home with a hospital pump and I would have been lost without this. Tricia put me in contact with Jenni when we left hospital.  \r\nWhen we were discharged we received support from Jenni in hospital and over the phone when I needed her. I breast fed the twins for 4.5 months and believe I never would have been able to do this without Jenni's support. She was always there on phone/text/in person when I needed her. She put together feeding plans for both twins who struggled gaining at different times. She supported me with breastfeeding tips and when to feed/pump/top-up with expressed milk or formula.  \r\nI was so exhausted and overwhelmed at times and having the support from Jenni really helped me. We have history of milk allergy in our family and Jenni was able to put a plan together for the twins, topping up with hydrolysed formula and only attempting the milk ladder when we were sure the twins were able to handle it.  \r\nWe are still working our way through the milk ladder and up until our recent discharge, Jenni was there to answer any query I had- even if it was just a quick text. One of the twins really struggled to gain weight at the start, dropping to the 0.2 centile. He is now thriving at the 75th for his weight. Without support from Jenni for him, I believe I would have stopped breastfeeding much sooner than I did and he would have had many more admissions to hospital for his weight loss.  \r\nThe service I received from Jenni was incredible. She is a valuable asset for any Mum struggling with breast feeding/weight gain/feeding multiples. I am so grateful we were referred to her for support.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-02-17T15:16:15.7433333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-02-20T09:10:44.187","readBy":[{"name":"South Eastern Health and Social Care Trust","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1031580?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1031580"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1031580/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1031580"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1031580/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1031580"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1031580/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1031580"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt004_07021_501?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"ZT004_07021_501","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/advice?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"advice"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/allergy?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"allergy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breast%20feeding?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"breast feeding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/twins?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"twins"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/weight%20loss?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"weight loss"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"supported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/an%20asset?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"an asset"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1032378?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1032378"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1032942?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1032942"}]},{"id":1031652,"author":"CearG21","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"They looked after me so well","body":"I just want to thank the wonderful service I received last Friday at Lagan Valley Hospital in Lisburn NI.

I am so grateful to the radiologist at Forth Valley Royal for making the observation and investigating further via internal ultrasound at the time. She was both kind and efficient, and I wish I could recall her name to thank her.  \r\nAt my time of life there's a higher risk that such growth could be cancerous and I was relieved at how fast referral and action happened.  \r\nI was also tremendously scared.  \r\nThe pre-op nurse Sharen was friendly, efficient and reassuring during my pre-op check, and a date for surgery came through quickly.  \r\nUnfortunately, I then developed a very troublesome cough which kept waking me in the night and put me in a bit of a panic about the operation and recovery so I phoned for advice. Pre-op nurse Trudy spoke kindly to me and also took the time to confer with the anaesthetist, before coming back to me straight away with advice to postpone. I was both grateful and even more scared in case the delay led to more harm. Fortunately , however, they were able to reschedule me just a couple of weeks later.  \r\nI attended FVR Ambulatory Care for day surgery, with an expected overnight stay. All staff encountered were friendly and efficient, which really helped as I was very frightened. The nurse who checked me in, both surgeons Consultant Sarah and Vicky, and Owen the anaesthetist, were friendly, informative, caring and efficient, as was the theatre technician assisting with my preparation. I am so grateful to them all.  \r\nSurgery went well and I was then transferred to the Women and Children's Department for overnight care. I needed nasal oxygen, and a full mask overnight due to low oxygen but the friendly and efficient nursing staff helped me cope with this. Pain management was excellent too. Night staff were on call a lot that night, another patient close by was very sick, and it was obviously a tough shift but they were all exemplary in attitude and care. Aside from the outstanding care of all the medical staff I'd like to put in a good word for the FVR catering staff too. The server was friendly, the menu decent, and the food simple, good, and hot. First class both main meals.  \r\nI was told that I could leave once my baseline oxygen reached a reliable 94/95 without assistance, I could empty my bladder, and was mobile. This was achieved by afternoon and I was home by tea time.  \r\nI am now one night home and in recovery, and cannot thank everyone concerned enough. I wish I could recall all their names because they were all deeply appreciated. Fingers crossed for a smooth recovery and huge thanks to all at Forth Valley.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-02-18T07:56:31.7766667","progress":"Story has a

As always, overall I was impressed with my experience. There was one part which was not as I would expect it to be (topic of conversation during the type of procedure), however I fed back via PALS and received the best response within 1.5 hours. It’s true that it is how feedback is taken and responded to that can influence how you feel and I’m relieved no other woman will experience this in the future due to the learning. Thank you for this service which allows medical staff to focus on patients. \n\nThere are some wonderful people in this hospital who commit to their roles well. Again, on calling the department to find out if it was the post impacting my biopsy result, I was immediately informed honestly of the situation. In the same call, I indicated my treatment preference and within 6 days an appointment letter arrived. This is exceptional. \n\nThe appointment was to time and I liked the guidance to get my post procedure prescription whilst waiting for the pre meds to take affect. I was surprised at the free prescription- what a refreshing change! The advice from the consultant on when to take the tablets was helpful, meaning I avoided unnecessary pain. The consultant was excellent. The nurses were attentive. I appreciated the consultant observer taking time to thank me for allowing him to see a treatment he may introduce to his setting- this I found very respectful. The room was well prepared. Thank you to all concerned. \n\nPlease could the hospital consider needing to wear face coverings during surgical procedures - with all precautions in place and being outside of a pandemic, I do think that a patient should be able to breathe freely. There is some pain/ discomfort and risk of nausea and deep air breathing helps.

I live a two hour drive from Daisy Hill hospital and unable to visit everyday. I was so grateful to be able to see and talk with my mother today using the virtual visit service.  \r\nIt's a fantastic service -my mother has temporarily lost her sight so is unable to use her phone so this service is perfect for her as someone sets it up for her and although she can't see me, she can hear and talk with me. Its such a relief to me that I can see how she is too. Also my son was able to join us and he lives in England which my mother really enjoyed.  \r\nThank you so much for organising this service it really is brilliant.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-02-18T12:14:26.0066667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-02-20T12:24:02.58","readBy":[{"name":"Southern Health and Social Care Trust","count":7}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1031886?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1031886"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1031886/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1031886"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1031886/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1031886"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1031886/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1031886"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003-vv?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"zt003-vv","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/family%20contact?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Family contact"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/well%20organised?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"well organised"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/relieved?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"relieved"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/service?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"service"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/virtual%20visiting?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"virtual visiting"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1032509?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1032509"}]},{"id":1031906,"author":"Grateful from Glasgow","authorRoleId":4,"authorRole":"a relative","title":"Wonderfully caring and compassionate staff","body":"My husband had knee replacement surgery at Stobhill Day Hospital, the care provided from admission to discharge was superb.

Went professional through everything, explaining what will happen, the pros and cons of having the procedure and what problems may or may not occur. Had all my stats taken and was taken to a lovely waiting area. Taken into the procedure and greated by the doctor and nurse who fully explained what they were doing and explained on screen where they were and why they were doing. Constantly asked how I was and reassured if I felt a bit worried. \nI thanked the doctor and nurse for the everything in the procedure as I thought it was done with professionalism and then I was moved into the recovery area. \nNurses were great throughout the day, professional and courteous and couldn't do enough for you even with it being on a Sunday. One nurse (sorry I don't remember the name) was so happy within her work she made me smile. So many dark clouds and so many bad reviews about hospitals that I needed to express how superb the whole time was when in the department. \nWell done to the endoscopy department in Grimsby, thank you for the whole experience seeing as though it's not the greatest thing to go through. \n5 stars.
