Despite multiple attempts I was unable to book, due to problems with swiftqueue, which were subsequently sorted by their technical support team. In the meantime I found it virtually impossible to get through to Healthshare Diagnostics by phone - number 11 in the call queue was the nearest I got. Meanwhile I was sent more texts and emails urging me to book, but when i finally managed to book through swiftqueue, the first appointment I was offered was in 6 weeks time - so what was the rush?  \r\nThe whole experience was very stressful, despite me being experienced in using computer technology. What hope would there be for anyone without a smartphone or computer? I am not impressed by the booking service of Healthshare Diagnostics.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-06-15T14:15:31.85","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-06-20T09:20:02.133","readBy":[],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/947737?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"947737"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/947737/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"947737"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/947737/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"947737"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/947737/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"947737"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/nyr?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"NYR","score":1},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/annoyed?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"annoyed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frustrated?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"frustrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/worried?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"worried"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/booking%20system?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"booking system"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20impressed?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"not impressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/puzzled?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"puzzled"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scan?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stressful?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"stressful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ultrasound?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"ultrasound"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/more%20capacity?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"more capacity"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1028500?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1028500"}]},{"id":948366,"author":"CurlyC","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"An unhappy encounter","body":"I had a brief and unhappy encounter with the Crisis Response Team - lacking empathy understanding and communication skills.

In this case, I had made contact due to feeling like I was going to self harm. I have also had a crisis team clinician dismiss my risks and tell me that I have to help myself due to my diagnoses being \"chronic\" Again, in this case I had made contact due to the risks I was having.  \r\nOn both of these occasions, I had made the crisis team clinicians aware that I was following my own care plan created by myself and my care coordinator. On both occasions the crisis team clinicians dismissed me and both failed to do any form of welfare check on me when I abruptly ended the call in tears.  \r\nI have placed a number of complaints into the trust regarding this service , yet in spite of this nothing has changed. I am constantly promised that lessons have been learnt, but they continue to treat me like I shouldn't be using the service with the diagnoses I have.  \r\nI would say that this service is not fit for purpose and something needs to change as an organisation. For example, ensuring that clinicians actually read and follow patients care plans.  \r\nUnfortunately, from my experience, I feel there are still members of staff who work for the IRS/Crisis Team in Sunderland who judge people with personality disorders by dismissing their crises and not taking them seriously. It is not appropriate for a crisis team clincian to tell a patient they cannot be helped in their crisis due to their diagnosis being chronic.  \r\nHow many more complaints have to be put in before something changes??","criticality":"strongly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-06-14T17:45:15.21","progress":"Change planned","dateOfPublication":"2022-06-20T10:58:07.223","readBy":[{"name":"Imperial

He therefore finds all transport difficult but especially busses. When he was transferred by patient transport to hospital at the request of the practice nurse who visited him at home I explicitly asked the ambulance staff if there would be a way to get him home again as we do not have family nearby and he would be too unwell to travel by bus. I was assured that the ward would be able to call for a patient transfer home. My husband did not want to go into hospital but was reassured by this. Later the same day my husband was discharged and told to make his own way home by bus as patient transfer was closed and this is not something they arrange unless it’s to a care home. I phoned the Scottish ambulance service and was told this this is not true, the ward could arrange him transport as part of his discharge. I am appalled that the staff thought it would be appropriate to send him on public transport alone and think that surely something needs to be in place past 5pm. I am well aware that services are stretched and that staff are under pressure but nothing feels very ‘caring’ about this patient care and I’m extremely upset by it.  \r\nA word about the Scottish ambulance service - superstars! Every encounter I’ve had with them on the phone they’ve been lovely and the men transferring my husband today were so friendly and kind.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-06-16T18:06:31.5733333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-06-20T11:21:29.353","readBy":[{"name":"Scottish Ambulance Service","count":7},{"name":"Aberdeen City Health & Social Care Partnership","count":1},{"name":"NHS Grampian","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/948189?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"948189"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/948189/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"948189"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/948189/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"948189"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/948189/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"948189"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/n101h?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"N101H","score":0},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/scot-ambulance-pts?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"scot-ambulance-pts","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ambulance%20crew?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"ambulance crew"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/chronic%20pain?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"chronic pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/concerned?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"concerned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/discharge?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"discharge"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/patient%20care?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"patient care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unhappy?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"unhappy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/conflicting%20information?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"conflicting information"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/access%20to%20transport?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"access to transport"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/telephone%20operator?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"telephone operator"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/948959?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"948959"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/952517?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"952517"}]},{"id":948957,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Great Patient Experience ","body":"Having been registered a few years I don't often visit the practice, that said, when I have visited I have had a welcoming and professional experience. \nPrimarily visiting the nurses for procedures I cannot commend them enough for their work, they were chatty & built rapport before explaining each phase of any procedure and ensured I was at ease. \nBooking appointments was easy & there have been no extensive wait times.

A few weeks ago I went to the antenatal assessment unit due to having reduced movements. The staff there were wonderful and reassuring and I felt well looked after, however they were concerned about my baby’s heart rate so I was admitted to Nettleham Ward overnight for monitoring. The 2 midwives I had there were lovely, though I felt slightly abandoned (I imagine they were super busy and so through no fault of their own).  \r\nDuring the evening my mum (birth partner) came back to the ward to bring me some things. This was well within the visiting times for birth partners (by several hours) but she was not allowed onto the ward despite staff knowing my situation and that she would be my partner during birth. Another midwife was sat at the nurses station and shouted asking why hadn't I got a proper partner, which I heard from my bed in the bay (I'm sure this comment was definitely about me as I marched straight to the desk and they quickly pedalled-back on the comment). Thankfully my midwife (who had actually finished her shift) got my mum onto the ward and explained (again) to staff who she was. Up until this point I felt reassured and well looked after; now I am dreading the pre and post care of my and my baby (I understand the labour ward staff are wonderful), and I will be declining an induction for this reason as I do not want to be on the antenatal ward any longer than I have to.  \r\nThis is the first person who has made me feel ashamed of my decision to have this baby as a solo mum and for not having a “partner”, which is disgusting. This one midwife (and another ward staff member who was just abysmally rude throughout) have ruined my experience of this ward and have made me very anxious and worried about going back and I now wish I was having my baby elsewhere.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-06-17T08:37:05.5266667","progress":"Story has a

I felt overall that the staff were brilliant. However, the level of care was sometimes very variable. On occasions the nursing staff were very slow to answer calls and I overheard members of the team gossiping. It was often worse during the evening when staff were talking at an elevated volume and were talking about patients. On one night shift the staff were watching tiktok videos and you could hear these throughout the ward. One of the most shocking occurrences was during the day when one staff member shouted a swear word at their colleagues when visitors were walking around the corridors. A number of staff had never worked in the hospital before, and some of these individuals were not able to give answers about quite basic matters.  \r\nThe food was also an issue and did not follow the guide that NHS Scotland stipulate. I have been to other hospitals where the proper options are available. At the GRI, the food was variable and there were only two to three choices per meal. During lunch there were only sandwiches and soup available, no jacket potatoes or anything else.  \r\nThe hardest part of being in the GRI was that the team in my ward refused to let me or anyone else leave the ward. You were not able to get any fresh air because supposedly too many people run away. This was the reason stated when I challenged a nurse on this. I don't feel it is correct to hold people without giving a solid reason, as we are supposed to not be prisoners. I really felt this had an impact on my mental health during the day, as I felt trapped. I mentioned this to a consultant, who said there was no clinical reason for me to be refused time outside. The consultant did say though, that ultimately the decision sits with the nurses, which I feel was ridiculous, as there was no sound reasoning to stop me going outside for 30 minutes in the evening. My whole argument was that I was there on a voluntary basis and would discharge myself if I really wanted to leave (which I did not want to do, as I wanted to get well again).

This was a major thing to happen to us as a family as a whole and being able to be there for dad to support him and also being able to speak to doctors and nurses as any time was a great help.  \r\nWhen dad was medically stable he was transferred to PRI Stroke Rehabilitation Unit. Our first experience and impression of the unit was not good, when we arrived there was nobody about to talk to about how dad was doing or what the facility was like/what to expect. (what treatment he would receive while there or what was offered) Visiting hours were very restricted which was very worrying for us about dads mental health and ours. When we were able to visit there was rarely anybody around, doctors or nurses to speak to about him and as dad was unable to speak he couldn’t tell us himself and was very isolating for him. We had to request a ‘ get to know you form’ which was filled out and retuned but seemed as though was put in a file and not looked at as a few days later we were offered us one or three forms.  \r\nHowever we have been able to voice our concerns and some seem to have been taken on board. As dad has now started to settle in to the routine of the unit and staff have started to get to know his personality and have a laugh and joke with him. That’s great as it really cheers him up, some of the staff go above and beyond to encourage him and treat him like anyone else.  \r\nVisiting hours have recently also been relaxed which is great for the whole family, it allows us to attend some physio sessions and be with/support him even more. Although I would say at the weekends dad does often get very down with the break in physio and speech and language sessions. Especially on long weekends such as bank holidays, he is in a room on his own and often left alone for long periods of time during these days out with visiting hours when we would be there. It doesn’t make sense to me in this day and age that we don’t have people to carry out these sessions 7 days a week.  \r\nWe still don’t often get to see doctors while we visit but some of the nurses are good at telling us how dad has been throughout the day. We have a little notepad which we use to write down any questions and often speech and language and physio therapists write notes on how dad did in his sessions that day which is really helpful as dad can’t tell us.  \r\nIt will be a long journey for us all but recently we have had a much more positive view of the unit and dads care has been really great, the physio and speech and language sessions are brilliant.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-06-17T11:10:20.3333333","progress":"Change planned","dateOfPublication":"2022-06-20T13:26:07.117","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Tayside","count":19},{"name":"Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists (RCSLT)","count":1},{"name":"Scottish Government","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/948407?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"948407"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/948407/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"948407"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/948407/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"948407"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/948407/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"948407"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/t202h-stroke?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"T202H-Stroke","score":3},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/above%20and%20beyond?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"above and beyond"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/physio?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"physio"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/positive?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"positive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/rehabilitation?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"rehabilitation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/speech%20and%20language?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Speech and Language"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/speech%20and%20language%20therapy?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"speech and language therapy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stroke?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"stroke"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unsure?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"unsure"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/information%20availability?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"information availability"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/restricted%20visiting?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"restricted visiting"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/950302?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"950302"}]},{"id":949006,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"A deteriorating practice","body":"I’ve belonged to the practice since birth.

There is no sense that I am a client of the practice.  It’s constantly changing rules and operations are centred on the practice staff and not the community it’s meant to be serving.  When you do get through the hours of waiting on phone or physically queuing, the nurses and GP have been professional and supportive.  However, the pharmacy is restricted and variable opening. I recently submitted repeat 10-days before expiring my supplies only to be told they hadn’t prepared and ended up needing to go elsewhere with paper certificate (which I got made up in up mins!). Yet the practice hasn’t (won’t?) sign up for the digital prescription delivery services that could ease their load and our frustrations ! Madness. It’s 2022. Go digital. Please. Hours of opening and the unpredictable and long wait times mean it’s impossible to manage your health if you’re working.  You need to take a holiday to get the simplest gp practice Related things sorted.  Text messages are received on the day that changes have been made giving no time to accommodate change.  Tests results are not available digitally (so again this drives visits to surgery and further load on the practice).  GP’s do call roughly on time but face to face consultation is a thing of the past despite the passing of covid. I couldn’t tell you who my GP is now as it’s been a succession of locums. Finally, there is no follow-up. When presenting with an issue, initial tests requested and then….nothing. You can assume tests are “ok” but then there’s no next steps established. Leaving you at square one fighting for another telephone appointment, retelling your story and trying to move it forward.  What a shame that a community practice has been let deteriorate to this position and that the practice management do not appear to have (or at least communicate) a recovery strategy.  I have reached out and offered my support as a community member to help improve. Didn’t even get a response.  My honest reflection? Shut the facility down. Invest in surrounding practices or new build with new management and clinical team.
