[{"id":918111,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Fantastic service","body":"I attended the equivalent of A and E Saturday pm following a slip on snow resulting in immense pain and loss of mobility in left arm/shoulder area. The receptionist was so friendly, polite and sympathetic and quickly got me signed in to wait. I didn’t have to wait long, and the nurse seeing me was so lovely - even got me some painkillers won her own initiative before trying to remove my jumper. Quick assessment followed by x ray showed I had broken my upper arm. They checked whether it was safe for me to go home and once that was confirmed with a follow up appointment at orthopaedics on Monday placed arm in a special sling, given lots of specific advice and even some codeine for the pain! What a super friendly, efficient and professional team they were, I couldn’t have asked for better. Top marks all round! This crucial hospital really needs to stay for North Yorkshire, it’s vital. Please support our NHS as much as you can and treasure the wonderful people we have working there.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-02-19T19:29:06","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-02-20T01:28:38","readBy":[{"name":"Healthwatch North Yorkshire","count":1},{"name":"South Tees Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/918111?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"918111"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/918111/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"918111"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/918111/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"918111"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/918111/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"918111"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rtr45?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"RTR45","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/arm?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"arm"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/broken?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"broken"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/in%20pain?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"in pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mobility?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"mobility"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/orthopaedics?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"orthopaedics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/painkillers?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"painkillers"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/safe?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/shoulder?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"shoulder"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/x%20ray?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"x ray"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/x-ray?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"X-ray"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wonderful?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"wonderful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20home?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"at home"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/926401?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"926401"}]},{"id":918119,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"trying to cancel appointment","body":"nearly 2 hours trying to cancel an appointment due to the weather each time after waiting several minutes phone went dead this happened 3 times asked for ext to breast clinic operator said they wont answer and she was right.

They lost the number, told him to go at 3.20am, still minus degrees, we had his coat as it was covered in blood, and they told us to take it. He had to ring a taxi and go home alone. Its just not good enough, I appreciate the trust is under pressure, but I would have cared for him, taking pressure from the staff, whilst the Doctor saw him and then I would have taken him home.

There was blood on the sheets, the doctor saw it and ripped it off the bed then threw the blood covered kitchen towel on the floor in the corner. I was eventually told my tests were clear and instead of booking my scan I was sent home with antibiotics, even though there was no signs of infection in my tests. I'm still in a lot of pain and even after ringing back up the staff want me to wait to see if the antibiotics work. They went against the recommendation of my doctor and have left me in pain and still unable to walk.

I came into surgery on the 18th at the Sunderland ward. I have previous pstd from this hospital after causing a blood clot and previous stressful child births experiences. I got to the door and was told my partner wasn't allowed in. I broke down as I was having a panic attack. I didn't realise how much I couldn't handle until then with my previous experiences. It said on the letter you was allowed one person. But obviously your not. They allowed my husband in a side box room with me. The nurses and Dr's came in and did the ops and check overs and I told them why I was crying and sad. No one gave a care. I held onto my partner as I was so frightened. I got told i was next and had to leave my partner. I had to wait 50 mins for my op. It was the afternoon. I was 4th on the list. I was a type 1 diabetic. There is no communication between the staff. The anesthetic Dr tried to put me higher on the list. Not sure what happened. After the op and back in the bay I asked for my husband. I quickly ate and drank and was sick and then quickly got dressed and went a loo and went and sat in the waiting area with my husband. I was really poorly. I was sick again and put back in the bay on a bed. I asked when I could be discharged. They informed me I could discharge myself. But no I had to wait as I need blood thinning meds. I did see other people on the ward with other patients. But because they were woman it was okay. But me it wasn't. I suffered terribly in the hands of the NHS. Mentally and physically. I would never have an op there again it's disgusting and staff don't communicate. I was stressed out. Which I didn't need with an op. No care or companssion and medical treatment is awful.

Following this we were quickly seen by caring Sister and Nurse and then with literally no waiting time were booked for an X-ray. There was no reception open at X-Ray but those in the department responded quickly and helpfully. My daughters X-Ray was completed in minutes and then we were back to A&E. Within 15 minutes we were called in to discuss the injury with another smiling, friendly nurse who then reviewed the X-Ray with a consultant and quickly informed us that all was good. \nOverall this experience lasted less than 1 1/2 hours. Which is amazing!! \nAt my local A&E this would normally be 4-5 hours. \nThank you all so much, my daughter is 14 and said that this was an amazing experience and everyone was lovely.

To be fair to the doctors they are very overworked and Covid hasn't helped. However,  there's almost never any follow-through or follow up now so problems I've been bringing up for months don't progress, and in fact have become worse. Can't access on-line appt requests now at all which means trying to call for a consult or appointment which is next to useless. I've even gone to the practice trying that route and again that didn't work. Its very frustrating and discouraging especially since a few years ago it wasn't like this.  Previously I would get a call after a referral to see if it had been successful or if something else was needed. If my blood work was out of balance I would get a call that day telling me to go to A&E for a 'top up' or to be aware of how it might affect me.  There seems to be a faster change over in doctors as well than previously. Maybe that's the nature of the beast but its not working for the patients.

have never once found it difficult to obtain prompt medical advice, either by a same day telephone call with a doctor or by way of a face to face appointment with a doctor or nurse, I have also always found that ordering repeat prescriptions to be easy by way of ordering online or over the telephone.\nWhenever I have had cause to visit the surgery I have noticed  the staff to be practically 'rushed off their feet' but they have always found the time to speak to me about my needs in a friendly, polite and professional manner and have always dealt with my medical problems very thoroughly and on a couple of occasions have gone above and beyond to ensure that I have received the prompt medical help that I needed at the time.\nI feel extremely lucky to be a patient of Terrington Surgery, many of my family and friends, who are registered with other practices in the Ryedale area, do not have the same excellent medical care which I receive, many of them are having to wait more than two weeks for a face to face appointment or a telephone call from their Doctor including my 80 year old mum who has several complex and painful medical conditions.\nI would like to say a very big thank you to every single one of the staff at Terrington Surgery and please please keep up your excellent work!","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-02-20T15:36:41","progress":"Story

I had developed blurred vision in both eyes and after seeing my optician she referred me to eye casualty.  \r\nI was admitted to the short stay ward where I had an unsuccessful lumbar puncture and needed to have an xray guided one. Initially the consultant thought I had idiopathic intracranial hypertension but my csf pressure was normal but showed high levels of white cells and raised proteins.  \r\nI was admitted to ward 4E neurology after a CT chest, abdomen and pelvis showed I had a large amount of enlarged lymph nodes in my chest and needed a biopsy to determine if I had lymphoma or sarcoidosis. My vision remained very poor and I was assessed each day by ophthalmology. I also had chest x-rays, a cardiac echo, pulmonary function tests, daily bloods, 2 weeks of intravenous antibiotics as I had positive blood cultures.  \r\nI also needed a full body MRI but I needed surgery to remove my spinal cord stimulator as it has metal in it and was not compatible with the MRI scanner. After 6 weeks I was finally diagnosed with neurosarcoidosis and pulmonary sarcoidosis after a biopsy was taken of my lymph nodes and I was treated with IV steroids. I was finally discharged after almost 7 weeks.  \r\nI certainly could not complain about my care or treatment from any department. The nursing staff were excellent as were the doctors and health care assistants. The domestic staff were constantly cleaning and the standard of cleanliness of the environment was extremely high. All staff were friendly.  \r\nI did find that some of the nurses did not understand what I and other patients were saying. However some of them had not been in Northern Ireland for very long, and their knowledge and understanding of the language would improve with time. This did not interfere with their quality of care.  \r\nI had to retire when I was 45 from a back injury and I was a registered nurse for 25 years, my last post as a band 7 ward manager for 10 years. I was very impressed with the standards in ward 4E, from all the staff, the information available about weekly audits on hand hygiene, environmental audits, falls and pressure sores which are standard audits in all wards in all hospital trusts in Northern Ireland.  \r\nThere was a high usage of agency staff who were block bookings and their standard of care was also high. I certainly understand the need for using agency staff due to the unrelenting shortage of registered nurses in northern Ireland.  \r\nThere were two band 6 deputy sisters on the ward but no band 7 ward manager/sister visible the entirety of my stay. There was a band 7 sister for the first 3 weeks but unfortunately she never introduced herself to any patients and did not appear to be ward based at all.  \r\nAs an ex-ward manager I think it is extremely important for the ward lead to be visible and accessible. I know I certainly introduced myself to patients and ensured I spoke to every patient each day if only for a few minutes.  \r\nDuring my stay visiting was reduced to one visit for one hour per week from a relative. I didn't find this to be a problem at the beginning as I felt too unwell to care but could see how much it distressed elderly patients. This could not be helped due to covid and staff spent time with those patients when time allowed.  \r\nThe main dislike I had was being moved from bay to bay during my stay. I understand staff were trying to keep bays with more independent patients together. However on one occasion I was moved to an all male bay. I was not asked if I consented or even minded being moved to an all male bay and I did mind. I don't think mixed sex bays are appropriate especially when the patient next to me was detoxing from alcohol and was extremely confused.  \r\nThe only issue with staff that I had during my entire stay was on the day I was moved to an all male bay. I informed the nurse looking after my bay that I was going to meet my parents and daughter to exchange dirty clothes for clean clothes and to see my father as he had just been diagnosed with lung cancer. I was off the ward approximately 20 minutes when the health care assistant came looking for me, to tell me a porter had arrived to take me for a procedure which I had no knowledge of being scheduled. I informed him that they had my mobile number if they needed to contact me.  \r\nI only got 5 minutes to spend with my family and returned to the ward. When I arrived I asked the nurse what test I was going for and they informed me that they just told me that to get me to come back to the ward. I was extremely upset about being lied to because at this stage I still had no diagnosis and any test was welcomed by me if I thought it would get me closer to a diagnosis. This upset me terribly and I ended up in tears.  \r\nNo patient should be told lies.

The hospital well it was so depressing, I can see they are renovating, and I think it will be nice when it’s finished but where I was well it looked like an air raid shelter.  \r\nThe surgery was good but the aftercare and I am not blaming the nurses they are working 17 hour long shifts but quite honestly they couldn’t do their jobs properly and I have no idea how they remained so cheerful.  \r\nThere was only 3 commodes for 27 beds.  \r\nI had 2 ripple beds both which leaked, and the pillows were like pancakes. The equipment needed just wasn’t there. I am not blaming the nurses they are doing a difficult job under extreme circumstances, and I have nothing but admiration for them however I had to have a catheter fitted as I was retaining fluid but this came out. I was told it would just be for 24 hours but ended up with it fitted for 6 days and I have had problems in that area since.  \r\nWhen I asked to go to the toilet I was told I had to be accompanied but a nurse wouldn’t be available for 30 minutes by which time I was too desperate and needed the commode. There is far too much to do for the amount of nursing staff.  \r\nTwo physiotherapists came to see me and insisted that I walked some steps but my dressing was tight and it was very painful, I told them this but they insisted and I felt bullied. I asked if they had been through a trauma like myself to which they replied no, and I told them not to judge me until they had.  \r\nThe day before I was due to go home there was a mix-up too. A nurse decided that I hadn’t been out of my bed that day and that I needed to show that I could walk before being allowed to go home. They insisted that I put my feet up. But I had been out if bed that day, twice I had a slow walk down the very very depressing corridor to where there was the only bit of natural light, but I did as the nurse asked. I felt so weak and felt like they didn't believe me and I was so upset that I burst out crying. Other staff came over and were very nice to me then.  \r\nOverall, the care since I came home (into respite) at Fernbank has been absolutely fantastic. The night before I was due home they sent someone to stay the night with me and I cannot fault them. Three times a week the nurse visits me and nothing is too much trouble for them. I highly recommend them.  \r\nAll in all I feel the poor nurses have to much to do and deserve a pay rise.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-02-18T09:16:27.2966667","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2022-02-21T09:20:01.937","readBy":[{"name":"Somerset NHS Foundation Trust","count":5},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2022)","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/917666?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"917666"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/917666/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"917666"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/917666/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"917666"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/917666/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"917666"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rh5a8-160?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"RH5A8-160","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rh5a8-orthopaedics?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"RH5A8-orthopaedics","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rh5-rehab?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"RH5-rehab","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/aftercare?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"aftercare"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bedding?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"bedding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/building?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"building"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/catheter?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"catheter"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/community%20rehabilitation?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"community rehabilitation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/depressing?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"depressing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/foot?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"foot"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/more%20staff?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"more staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/respite?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"respite"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sepsis?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"sepsis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/access%20to%20toilets?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"access to toilets"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/some%20staff%20attitude?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"some staff attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lack%20of%20equipment?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"lack of equipment"}]},{"id":917761,"author":"empathy85","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Excellent care at emergency department let down by a patronising doctor","body":"I visited Altnagelvin's A&E dept last weekend due to a prolonged episode of SVT (fast heart rhythm). After being unable to calm it myself after 15 mins and my heart rate still over 170 bpm I made my way to the hospital (as advised to do by my own GP). I had taken one of my prescribed tablets to help stop the SVT episode and it had not worked either.  \r\nAfter reporting to reception I was sent straight through to A&E and was quickly hooked up to an ECG where the staff were able to see my SVT in action. The SVT soon corrected itself after this (lasted approximately 35/40mins in all).  \r\nI was then taken round to resus and hooked up to a heart monitor and had bloods taken and was told I would be getting a chest x-ray. I cannot fault the reception staff or the nurses and doctors up until now - they were amazing - so attentive and caring. I obviously was stressed and anxious but they all made me feel at ease and I felt well cared for.  \r\nAfter an hour a senior doctor appeared (unfortunately I cannot remember their name) and abruptly told me I could go. I said ok and asked were my blood results clear and they told me they weren't back but they were sure they would be ok. I was a little unnerved by this as I would have expected these to be checked before leaving but assumed they would not send me home unless they were certain.  \r\nI mentioned that the other doctors had said about an x-ray to which the doctor responded that I wouldn't need one. They then told me they would give me a minute to unhook myself from the heart monitor. I was shocked. The heart monitor had patches all over my chest and abdomen and leads. I also had a blood pressure cuff still attached. They were leaving me to unhook and disconnect everything myself.  \r\nAt that moment I felt like a hindrance. I had not asked to be moved there and I was more than happy to leave but their manner was so unprofessional and demeaning. I was incredibly sad leaving the hospital after what had been an excellent experience until I met this doctor.  \r\nI advised the doctor I was currently waiting for a cardiology appt after previous prolonged SVT episodes. These have become more frequent in the last month, so naturally I am concerned if there is an underlying reason or cause.  \r\nThe doctor told me if I get an episode to pop a pill and relax on the sofa until it stops. Not quite what it advises on the NHS's own website.  \r\nI do not make complaints normally, but this doctor's manner was patronising and left me feeling hurt and angry. I appreciate the NHS are under huge pressure and stresses. The other staff I met were all lovely.  \r\nIf the bed was needed I had no issue vacating it and waiting in the reception area until my bloods were back - not to be made to feel stupid.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-02-18T14:11:02.6966667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-02-21T09:20:02.03","readBy":[{"name":"Western Health and Social Care Trust","count":7},{"name":"Ulster University, MBBS (Medicine) 2021","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/917761?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"917761"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/917761/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"917761"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/917761/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"917761"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/917761/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"917761"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt005_45020_180?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"ZT005_45020_180","score":3},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/angry?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"angry"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/patronised?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"patronised"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sad?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"sad"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20pressure?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"blood pressure"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cardiology?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"cardiology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ecg?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"ECG"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/heart?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"heart"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/heart%20rate?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"heart rate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hurt?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"hurt"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/most%20staff?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Most staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/quick?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"quick"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supraventricular%20tachycardia?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Supraventricular tachycardia"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/svt?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"SVT"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bad%20manners?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"bad manners"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/919188?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"919188"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/922100?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"922100"}]},{"id":917825,"author":"irishhaze36","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Attending a Gynae Oncology clinic as a patient","body":"I was advised in the appointment letter that it was a teaching hospital and that medical students or trainee doctors may be in attendance.

One recommendation I have is that it would be nice to have a warning that male staff will be present, before the procedure. In saying this, however, it wasn’t a negative experience at all. In fact, the staff were very respectful and put me at ease. I think I just needed to prepare myself for it mentally beforehand, and I think others may feel the same. If it could be mentioned or put in literature that male staff might be present, I think patients would be more prepared mentally.  \r\nMr.Flood, Jen and Marie were very good and clear about every step of the way.

They help you get into positioning etc. and keep you chatting to keep your mind off what’s happening.  \r\nThe doctor looks under the microscope and checks the cervix.

Overall service is good.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-02-21T08:19:38","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2022-02-21T11:55:31","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/918285?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"918285"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/918285/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"918285"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/918285/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"918285"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/918285/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"918285"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l83097?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"L83097","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/elderly?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"elderly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20good?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"not good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happy?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20happy?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"not happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20happy?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"very happy"}]},{"id":917395,"author":"indigoeb93","authorRoleId":4,"authorRole":"a relative","title":"My Dad","body":"My Dad has had pain in both his hips for a couple years.  \r\nHe had an X-ray in 2021 and was told that he had osteoarthritis in both hips. He has been on the urgent list since August 2021.  \r\nThe consultant told my Dad that his hips were in a bad way, but that the waiting list was up to 6 months. He was told that he had a (ttg) date of before Christmas 2021. It is now February 2022 and no op.  \r\nI think that this is totally unacceptable as my Dad has had to stop working as he is in so much pain. He can barely walk and is starting to look deformed due to the limp he has had for all these years. He also can barely attend any dinners/family events as he can’t sit in normal chairs for longer than 10 minutes.  \r\nIt makes me so angry as he has paid his contributions for over 40 years and this is how he is treated. It is having a massive strain on his and our full family’s mental health.  \r\nOnce a champion golfer and well known and liked around the golfing community, he has had to give up his membership and hasn’t seen a lot of his friends in over 1.5 years. He also looks set to miss my wedding this year, which I find really unacceptable in a situation that could have been avoided.  \r\nHe has agreed to go to any hospital for the procedure yet there still hasn’t been an offer.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-02-17T13:26:02.2733333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-02-21T11:57:40.14","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Ayrshire & Arran","count":10}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/917395?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"917395"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/917395/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"917395"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/917395/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"917395"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/917395/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"917395"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/a111h_110?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"A111H_110","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/angry?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"angry"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/exhausted?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"exhausted"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hip%20pain?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"hip pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/in%20pain?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"in pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/limp?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"limp"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/long%20waiting%20list?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"long waiting list"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/osteoarthritis?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"osteoarthritis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/procedure?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"procedure"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unacceptable?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"unacceptable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"waiting"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/walk?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"walk"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/walking?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"walking"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/xray?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Xray"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/x-ray?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"X-ray"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/919489?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"919489"}]}]
