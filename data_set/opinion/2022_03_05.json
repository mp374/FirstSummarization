Credit where credit is due their roll out of the Covid Vaccine was excellent and Flu jabs are administered efficiently but that is where it ends. It is hard to assess the medical care because it is practically impossible to get an appointment. Whilst I appreciate the pressures on GP surgeries caused by Covid they seriously need to review their appointment booking system. I am at a loss to understand how any organisation can think it is a good idea to expect patients, many of whom will be ill or suffering to have to phone at 8am for either an urgent on the day consultation or to book a 2 or 7 day advance appointment. It is not possible to book an appointment in a month or two weeks, only 2 or 7 days nor to book an appointment online or even to book an appointment at reception. They seem to have no concept of the fact that some patients simply cannot ring at 8am, due to work or other commitments. Of course the second the phone lines open at 8am so many patients are trying to call, that the phone lines are constantly engaged so it is practically impossible to even get into their queuing system. If you try to call a little later in the morning you might get through but will be told all the appointments have gone, try again tomorrow morning at 8! I saw a GP in December who arranged some blood tests and asked me to book a double appointment with her afterwards to follow up. After about four phone calls and goodness knows how long spent on the phone trying to book this appointment, I was eventually told I couldn’t book a double appointment or a face to face with this doctor. I did manage, some weeks later to get a 10 minute phone consultation only to be told that she didn’t have time to discuss all my issues! Presumably if a Doctor specifically asks you to book an appointment to see them again it is because they think this is necessary so it is extremely frustrating when you cannot do so.

Would not recommend. Avoid for the sake of retaining your mental health. If getting an appointment is stressful, the rest of your health issues will pale into insignificance.

I’m able to tolerate this and navigate the system for myself and my child but I am writing this review because for others this may not be the case. The reality is that the receptionist staff are front of house and represent the practice as well providing access to the care patients need. If this is mostly poor it let’s down the rest of the team. I worry for more vulnerable patients who may give up at the first hurdle if they encounter one of the rude receptionists and what implications this may have.

Bad Doctoring. Unworkable…","body":"I visited the drs last year with a very clear set of circumstances and requests based on family medical history. I now know the tests I asked for were not carried out and my notes were listed as something other than what I attended the clinic about. Furthermore I visited last week and they rushes tests through as they were missed last time. I haven't been able to get an appointment with the Dr so paid to see a private Dr. They referred me to a specialist at some heinous cost, and I requested simple data from my GP and VMC and nothing happened. I dropped in a letter of notes yesterday from my specialist that needed to be actioned urgently and upon visiting today to check why I hadn't heard anything, it turns out they have lost my letter. I fortunately hade a duplicate. This is all to say the system there is broken, they phone lines are a disaster. No priority to pick up, I waited on hold for 49 mins yesterday before being cut off when they picked it up. So I ended up wailing in. No support, no open arms value of ones health and functioning by a very broken playbook. I will be leaving this practice and would suggest you think carefully before becoming a patient. BTW, you can never every get an appointment unless its down as an emergency. Not being able to see a Dr other than a phone call is responsible for me being hospitalised just over e hear ago with something that was actually a very minor issue- that would have been cleared up by seeing a dr in person and a prescription. Note. The receptionists are doing the best that they can do and have to deal with a lot of pressure from the public, because the system is not working. I do feel for them, however, the service lives and dies with communication, personal visits and assigned Dr/Patient knowledge.  As soon as the issue I'm going through is completed, I will leave this practice.

This was short notice, as indeed I am sure many of these appointments are, and we were invited to attend at 11am. Clearly this is a tense time for anybody and we were no exceptions. We were kept waiting for a while which was no problem and then seen by the Nurse in charge of the TIA clinic who most efficiently sent us off for a neck ultrasound scan, followed by a MRI brain scan. We were then seen by a consultant who was able to reassure us after seeing the results of the tests that there had not been a TIA or stroke and we could relax on that score.

I attended the Richmond Clinic for the first time at 22 weeks gestation. I had to undergo a surgical abortion under general anaesthetic - with the procedure being separated into two parts. I began the procedure with the dilapan insertion the day before the surgery - it was probably the most difficult part for me physically, I would be an extremely anxious person and the nurses were more than understating, compassionate and extremely reassuring. The following day I came back in around 8.30am and went up to theatre around 10.30am, I was okay with the wait as you are expected to be there all day. Again, the nurses before theatre check in on you and were extremely supportive. When I went up to theatre I was nervous as it was my first time receiving GA, I was greeted and introduced to the anaesthetist team and they were very reassuring. Next thing I know I am waking up in the ward with a nurse monitoring me as soon as I woke, given a glass of water and rested there until ready to move to recovery room where I was given tea and biscuits. I was fortunate enough to wake up without any nausea or extreme drowsiness, which I was worried about beforehand. I was allowed to leave around 40 minutes to and hour after being in the recovery room. The nurses were lovely enough to let my partner come up to the discharge room and stay in the wait room while I was in surgery and also updated him on how I was doing when I came to recovery room. The staff were wonderful - they deal with such a difficult daunting time with such care and compassion. I felt completely reassured the whole time I was there. Don’t be afraid to ask as many questions as you feel like they are so accommodating and understanding. Thank you so much to all the staff members there for looking after me and making me feel so reassured.

I feel like their lab rat as they sound very amateur in treating mental health (among other conditions I sought help for in the past). Last time a doctor called me to review my medication completely out of the blue and was asking me if I believe I should go into a new medication, without explaining anything to me about it, and expecting me to be at a position of making an informed decision. Apart from the badly trained doctors, even worse is the reception staff. I have countless time felt belittled by the staff on the phone. My most recent experience two days ago, I called to ask why I haven't been contacted after I completed my eConsult 2 days ago and the receptionist on the phone was abrasive and sarcastic when I told her I don't remember when I completed it.

The doctor listened carefully and arranged for all the appropriate blood tests and I then went back for a follow up appointment. Within a week of attending the first appointment I was diagnosed as having diabetes & hypertension and had a doctors appointment to feedback the results and implement a treatment plan and then I had a follow up with the nurse. The advice & education was excellent. I was even lent a BP monitor for the first month. Recently I have attended the surgery for an injection in my shoulder and the service again was superb. Hygiene standards were faultless and in less than a week my problem has been 90% resolved. I work as a Senior Nurse with one of the specialists ODNs and I can honestly say the standard of care provided at this practice is excellent. The doctor was very understanding and listened, the receptionists were excellent in arranging appointments and contacting me and both the nurse who took my bloods and the other one who did my diabetic appointment were faultless and very professional. Having not visited the surgery for a long time I was impressed by the standard of the waiting area with a lovely new floor and clean environment and they had an excellent system for managing Covid restrictions. The whole team were professional and caring and a credit to the NHS. Thank you.
