I came to the Silverwood Ward as I have been experiencing suicidal thoughts, but so far I have been seeing a major improvement within myself, all thanks to the staff here. They have been amazing, as they have been providing the right treatment for me.  \r\nThere’s not one that stands out to me, as all of them have played their part very well in my recovery journey. It has taken a while for me to get to where I am today, and although I do have my down days, I know that I have the support of the staff to be open with how I am feeling. What is great about all of them is that any time I tell them how I am feeling, they take their time to listen to me. Even though there are lots of us on this ward, they still make time to help you.  \r\nThey do try and get me to participate in activities, but I'm not really interested in them, and when I say this they understand and never force me to do things that they know I will not enjoy. They have been trying to help me become more involved with these things, but we are taking small steps at a time.  \r\nThe food so far is good but would like to see more of a variety available as it can be boring when it’s the same thing over and over. My room is very well laid out, it is cleaned regularly and kept the way I like it. Most importantly the bed is very comfortable!  \r\nThe communication between me, the doctors and nurses has also been excellent as they speak to me on a level that I am comfortable at and will understand. I would also like to say that I am very grateful for the support that they have been providing to me, and I understand that their job isn’t easy treating us, but I hope they understand that they are making a positive impact on our lives!","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-11-30T19:20:10.6233333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-12-01T08:23:18.037","readBy":[{"name":"Southern Health and Social Care Trust","count":6}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1003135?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1003135"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1003135/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1003135"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1003135/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1003135"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1003135/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1003135"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_32024-bluestone?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"ZT003_32024-bluestone","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing%20staff?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"amazing staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cleanliness?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"cleanliness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"supported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/food%20variety?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"food variety"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1003326?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1003326"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1006859?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1006859"}]},{"id":1002269,"author":"Conen65","authorRoleId":4,"authorRole":"a relative","title":"Long wait for appointment","body":"Urgent referral made by GP to neurology after my brother with a brain injury experienced 4 sudden unexplained falls.

This and what followed led to me becoming an inpatient as part of the Tyrone and Fermanagh Hospital.  \r\nI have a care plan put in place by the Omagh Mental Health Crisis Team, and the whole midwifery staff were meant to read my notes and be aware of the tablets I take for my mental health. I used my own supply, as they found it difficult to source the correct drug. My husband had a quiet word with the midwife, who allowed him to stay, then suddenly asked him to leave at 5 a.m. asap on a stormy horrible night. They were worried they'd be told off by their boss, the ward sister, who stuck to strict visiting times. Sisters on the SWAH were lovely, let him stay, allowed him meals, and told we would all be discharged together.  \r\nTwo particular midwives said there was a bruise on my baby’s forehead above a birth mark, a new bruise, suggesting I had harmed her. They said they were only following procedures, and went straight to the head of childen's doctor. Not their boss, I thought. The children's doctor said there was no bruise, and the sister agreed.  \r\nThat night, I had a mental breakdown. The midwives refused to phone my husband on my behalf, as I couldn’t speak, but because of confidentiality they couldn’t tell my baby’s dad about this suspected bruise. Sister said to phone my husband with what the situation was, and can he come on in immediately. I had asked the sister if she would see if anyone in the SWAH could talk to me about my current mental health, which I felt was really suffering at this point.  \r\nNext, the sister tells me they are taking my baby away to neonatal, as her sodium levels are high and she needs extra care down there. All the staff I met in neonatal with my husband supported us to become first-time parents and waited on blood results. I spoke to a lovely mental health team who gave me a tablet to help me a sleep, very helpful.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-12-01T08:01:28.76","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-12-01T09:04:02.833","readBy":[{"name":"Western Health and Social Care Trust","count":8},{"name":"Ulster University, MBBS (Medicine) 2021","count":2},{"name":"Public Health Agency","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1003319?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1003319"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1003319/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1003319"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1003319/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1003319"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1003319/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1003319"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt005-swah-501?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"zt005-swah-501","score":1},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anger?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"anger"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxious?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"anxious"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/awful?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"awful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/birth?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"birth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breakdown?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"breakdown"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/c%20section?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"c section"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care%20plan?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"care plan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/drug?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"drug"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/natal?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"natal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/neonatal?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"neonatal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ward%20sisters?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"ward sisters"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health%20crisis?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"mental health crisis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/overwhemed?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"overwhemed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reading%20notes?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"reading notes"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health%20team?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"mental health team"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/following%20care%20plan?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"following care plan"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1004391?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1004391"}]},{"id":1002279,"author":"centauruskd98","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Excellent examples of their profession","body":"Yesterday I was admitted to the Surgical Unit 1 at Grantham and District Hospital for a stent removal, having had one fitted in July.

After an x-ray which showed it was bone on bone, I was referred to St Michael's.  \r\nThe lovely doctor I saw was so friendly and helpful. She was kind, gentle and tried to help in every way she could. She said she thought a steroid injection might help, but not guaranteed. In the meantime, she gave me advice on how to strap it to limit the pain. I received an appointment within 6 weeks.  \r\nThe injection itself was painful, but I was warned about that. It's been one week since the injection, and my finger has stopped hurting totally!! I am amazed and delighted. The doctor told me it might or might not work, she also said there were no guarantees on how long it would last, but for the time being I am pain free.  \r\nThe hospital and every person I met in the two visits I made were professional, caring, thoughtful, smiling and lovely. I cannot praise the NHS enough. Too many people complain, not enough give praise. I totally respect these people who work to help others - in fact one nurse was working on her day off.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-11-29T09:06:27.3733333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-12-01T09:19:38.79","readBy":[{"name":"Royal Cornwall Hospitals NHS Trust","count":3}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1002281?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1002281"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1002281/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1002281"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1002281/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1002281"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1002281/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1002281"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/ref02-trauma-orthopaedics?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"ref02-trauma-orthopaedics","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bone?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"bone"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/caring?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"caring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/finger?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"finger"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hand?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"hand"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helpful?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"helpful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/humbled?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"humbled"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/injection?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"injection"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/joint?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"joint"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain%20free?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"pain free"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/positive?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"positive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professional?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"professional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/xray?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Xray"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/steroid%20injections?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"steroid injections"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/experts?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"experts"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1003351?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1003351"}]},{"id":1002284,"author":"marwy59","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"I’m leaving a new woman","body":"After a spell of feeling unwell, I found myself in loane house ward 1, but I have to say I couldn’t have been sent to a better place.

Our daughter spent long periods in and out of the hospital and it was this ward (formerly ward one at old hospital) that we spent our time on.  \r\nSometimes our stays were over 6 weeks, or longer.  \r\nThe care, dedication, respect you received as a parent , and also the patient was amazing.  \r\nThe ward could not of been anymore caring for the situations and how ill our daughter was on occasions.  \r\nIt was a very busy ward dealing with children with complex needs , respiratory issues and numerous other illnesses .  \r\nThe staff always ensured your child received the best of care , whilst working a very busy and changing and challenging ward.  \r\nDue to our daughters illness we were in a cubicle /room so for us we had the peace and quiet from a very busy ward .  \r\nThe play specialist ensured we had whatever we needed for our daughter , lights , books etc and she would come and sit with our daughter to let me out for a coffee, or it was just nice to have a chat with her and someone to speak to about our daughter.  \r\nAs a family we built up a great relationship with this ward, and the staff are like an extended family. As our daughters health deteriorated the staff were there for us and again so supportive and ensured we were alright. In January this year our daughters health took a massive turn for the worst , and my father in law passed away at the same time; life was hard. Dealing with a lot of emotions , what it showed us was the staff are just human like everyone else , yes they have a job to do but they are human as well,  \r\nI remember one day the ward was quieter which was very unusual, and the staff bathed our daughter. The music and laughter from that room was something we hold as great memories, the staff were getting time to be with their patients and enjoy the fun times  \r\nThe staff came in to express their condolences, and ensure we were alright. They managed to get us into Ronald McDonald so we could be together as a couple and take a minute from the ward, to get to our daughter something - we were ever so grateful.  \r\nOur last admission was in July and the staff were aware that our daughters health was on a very thin line , it was upsetting as we knew we probably wouldn’t be back at the hospital again which was hard to accept .  \r\nOur daughter passed away in August at home , and it was an honour to have a lot of the staff at her funeral , people that mean so much to us.  \r\nWe have also been back to visit the ward as we will never forget 15 years of our life we’ve spent there .  \r\nThe ward is run very well, patients needs are at the forefront, the staff are dedicated and work very hard. The charge nurses are there on hand to support and help when things get tough - a great way of working .  \r\nThese people are not recognised enough for the hard work , dedication they provide on a daily basis. We certainly take our hat of to them and can’t thank them enough  \r\nAlso would like to thank A&E who ensured that we got the best of service on admission. As we were mostly 999 in to hospital they ensured we were treated as soon as possible. And to Castle Mey wards where we have spent time, again treated with respect and dignity, and again they work so hard  \r\nThank you to the Sick Childrens Hospital in Edinburgh, new friends for life. We will never forget what you done for us as a family.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-11-29T10:10:04.9933333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-12-01T09:46:10.943","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lothian","count":13},{"name":"Scottish Government","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1002296?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1002296"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1002296/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1002296"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1002296/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1002296"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1002296/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1002296"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/s225h_180?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"S225H_180","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/s225h-dalhwa?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"S225H-DalhWa","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/busy%20ward?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"busy ward"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dedication?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"dedication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/end%20of%20life?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"end of life"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/family%20support?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"family support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/passed%20away?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"passed away"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/respect?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"respect"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/respiratory?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"respiratory"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"amazing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dignity?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Dignity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"supported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/play%20specialist?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"play specialist"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/funeral?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"funeral"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/peace%20and%20quiet?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"peace and quiet"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/well%20run%20ward?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"well run ward"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1004986?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1004986"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1011550?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1011550"}]},{"id":1002298,"author":"Appreciative Nigel","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Positive experience in A&E","body":"I was taken in to A&E by ambulance  \r\nI have prostate and bone cancer, there was concern that I had Spinal Cord Compression.

In the last session I had before I quit, I dared to wonder aloud whether my social anxiety might have to do with my explosive parent, and the counsellor snapped back: “I’m not a psychologist; we’re not here to analyse.” I had only made this comment because the counsellor had told me they thought my paranoid behaviour was linked to my relationship with my parents... And afterward, when I told the counsellor that I’ve been suffering from anxiety attacks since I was 13, she suggested we talk about the circumstances in my life at that time that could have induced the attacks…go figure. I felt so confused about what exactly this “talking space” was for, having got mixed messages left and right, which left me feeling humiliated, rejected and more depressed than I was at the start.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-11-30T15:58:00","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2022-12-01T09:51:27","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1003341?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1003341"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1003341/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1003341"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1003341/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1003341"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1003341/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1003341"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rnudt?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"RNUDT","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confused?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"confused"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/depressed?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"depressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/panic?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"panic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/humiliated?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"humiliated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doing%20well?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"doing well"}]},{"id":1002299,"author":"Falconer 1","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"A job well done","body":"I had a pre-op assessment carried out by Jo at the Vale of Leven Hospital, I’ve had a lot of dealings with various departments in the NHS over the last 2 years and always been very happy with the staff and the treatments.  \r\nThe way that Jo conducted the whole assessment was simply brilliant, she made me feel so at ease and made the whole process actually enjoyable, this was a perfect example of a person doing their job as good as it could be done.  \r\nThank you Jo 🙏","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-11-29T10:15:29.2966667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-12-01T09:52:26.23","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":7},{"name":"NHS Highland","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1002299?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1002299"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1002299/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1002299"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1002299/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1002299"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1002299/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1002299"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/c206h-pre-op?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"C206H-pre-op","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/brilliant%20staff?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"brilliant staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good%20job?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"good job"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pre-op%20assessment?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"pre-op assessment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20at%20ease?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"put at ease"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1004741?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1004741"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1005347?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1005347"}]},{"id":1002295,"author":"wyliem02","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"I do not take their work for granted","body":"I woke at 7 a.m. with a pain in the chest, and after a few moments it grew gradually worse instead of better. I rang for an ambulance. After the initial 111 was repeating automated COVID procedures, 1hr and 10mins later the ambulance crew arrived and took BP and ECG. They were very reassuring and of great comfort. I was taken to the Ulster, but waited in the ambulance while staff consulted with the ambulance crew over a second ECG. I was then rushed to the RVH.  \r\nI was taken to the Cath-lab, and a line was inserted in my wrist. I was told I was having a heart attack at this stage and they were clearing a clot. I had felt the effects of previously administered morphine, so I was drowsy and felt no pain or discomfort.  \r\nOnce stablised, I was moved to a room and given a COVID test, which unfortunately tested positive. I found out in the days that followed that it was a S.C.A.D and I had a congenital condition that would be investigated further with an MRI at a later date. I remained in a ward with other patients until I was moved to room in the Ulster.  \r\nA cardiac consultant doing the rounds had planned a CT scan, but only realised I had tested positive for COVID when I told him. The tests were put off until I received 2 negative lateral flows. All tests were inconclusive, so when I was discharged a few days later, I was told I would need to go back in September for CT and ECG .  \r\nMy stay at both hospitals was comfortable and anxiety-free, given the circumstances. The nursing staff were kind and considerate. In the weeks that followed I was reluctant to do anything, as I didn't know my limitations or what damage was done by the torn artery. When I went back in September to the Ulster, I was given the all clear from the S.C.A.D. It had made a full repair. I am still on the waiting list for MRI.  \r\nDuring my stay at the Ulster, I was told that I would be contacted by cardiac nurse Roisin in the Downe Hospital to schedule a bleep test and possible rehab. I embraced this, as I knew it was the motivation I needed to being healthy again. The environment was ideal, as I was placed in a session group with other individuals, who in my opinion had endured much more serious events.  \r\nThroughout the 8 weeks, Roisin and her team delivered a friendly session that consisted of exercise and tutorials that informed and motivated me and gave me the confidence to improve week after week. I am still mindful of my S.C.A.D event and wait for the MRI with more curiosity than dread.  \r\nIn a few weeks I hope to be referred on to Phase 4 of the Cardiac Rehab, where I would be increasing the activity level for a longer period of time, and build it into a lifestyle choice rather than a hurdle to overcome.  \r\nI am very grateful for Roisin, her team, and all of the NHS staff that have so kindly devoted their time and energy into recovering patients like myself and others. I do not take their work for granted, and I hope I do not require their assistance again for quite some time.","criticality":"not

Long story, but to get to main points: waited 7 hours for a bed. So, the first bit is to do with getting to the ward, a very nice volunteer got me a wheelchair and took me to Urology, so why can’t they take you up to the ward? An 80-year-old man who also waited all day was told 90 mins for a porter? A lovely nurse took me up herself, as the wait for me was an hour. Volunteers are there, and plenty of them.  \r\nSecond bit is the discharge process. It was a weekend, so I expected a delay, but I was told I was going home at 10 a.m. But I wasn't out until 5.30, due to the wait with the discharge letter and prescription. There were about 9 of us on that section waiting to go home, 9 beds that could have been allocated to other patients. Imagine that multiplied all over the hospital.  \r\nNow, I know why people have to wait so long, this had nothing to do with the elderly who can’t get home. I was told it's the same every weekend, not so bad during the week, you usually get out by 3. Still, a long delay. This could make a huge difference to the ambulance waiting times.  \r\nIt’s just really scary that something that to me sounds easy to fix isn’t done, maybe a doctor on a few hours overtime at weekends to make sure discharges are completed by 1 p.m. The knock-on effect is huge. The staff themselves in the hospital were absolutely fantastic at all times.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-11-29T10:35:46.0866667","progress":"Story has a

The scan had been booked and I was told I would need to see the consultant afterwards but I wasn't given a letter or appointment time to see the consultant or informed I would first be having a BP check and urinalysis. When I was called I assumed I was going to see the consultant so my wife got up and came with me. As we approached the staff member said it was just the patient who should be coming in and explained this was just for BP etc. which was of course not a problem.  \r\nThe staff member then proceeded to ask if we were sisters to which I replied no this is my wife. I understand that it wasn't said with any ill intent but I'm sure they wouldn't say to a male and female attending are you brother and sister which shows a lack of awareness. If they had apologized and left it at that I would have shrugged it off but the staff member then went on to say we really looked alike and could be twins which I found entirely inappropriate. If this staff member saw a heterosexual couple both with brown hair and blue eyes would they also assume they were siblings and upon finding out they are a married go on to say they look related?  \r\nI could tell from the persons manner and tone they didn't mean to cause any upset but it did still upset me. It might seem trivial but when things like this happen it makes you feel like you have to validate your relationship. It's also a very odd thing for someone to say you look like you are related to the person you have married. I think some improved education on diversity and understanding the impact of situations like this would be beneficial.  \r\n[Very unhappy with 'Staff attitude']  \r\n  \r\n[Very unhappy with 'Explanations']  \r\n[Very unhappy with 'Seeing the whole me']  \r\n","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-11-29T11:56:13.15","progress":"Change planned","dateOfPublication":"2022-12-01T10:38:19.98","readBy":[{"name":"Office of Alexander Burnett, MSP for Aberdeenshire West","count":1},{"name":"NHS Grampian","count":16},{"name":"Scottish Government","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1002344?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1002344"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1002344/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1002344"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1002344/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1002344"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1002344/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1002344"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/n161h?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"N161H","score":2},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disappointed?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/embarrassed?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"embarrassed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/antenatal?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"antenatal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/growth?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"growth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/information?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"information"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scan?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attitude?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"staff attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20awareness?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"staff awareness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/timely%20appointments?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"timely appointments"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/validation?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"validation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/explanations?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"explanations"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1006413?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1006413"}]},{"id":1002354,"author":"andrewsd09","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Rodent ulcer removal","body":"Very welcoming and reassured by Kirsty and Laura.

I saw a very caring and professional gynaecologist, and was referred for an urgent scan later that afternoon (it was past midnight when I was seen). \n\nThis was the best experience I have ever had of using an A&E department, I was so much calmer and felt reassured after leaving, and I felt every single member of staff I saw genuinely cared about me - despite the pressures they were under and how busy the department was. Thank you, Chesterfield Royal Hospital. \n\n","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-11-30T17:05:17","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-12-01T12:09:04","readBy":[{"name":"Sheffield Hallam University, Nursing BSc (21-9)","count":1},{"name":"Chesterfield Royal Hospital NHS Foundation Trust","count":2},{"name":"The Miscarriage Association","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1003386?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1003386"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1003386/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1003386"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1003386/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1003386"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1003386/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1003386"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rfsda?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"RFSDA","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20cared%20for?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"not cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bleed?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"bleed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20about?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Cared about"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/early%20pregnancy?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"early pregnancy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/informed?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pregnancy?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"pregnancy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scan?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surprised?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"surprised"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20for?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/in%20the%20way?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"in the way"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/comfortable?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"comfortable"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1004813?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1004813"}]},{"id":1003396,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Brilliant surgery","body":"Fantastic experience at spa medica.

In A&E 2 days, and the care I was given was horrific.  \r\nI was left to sit in a porter chair for over 9 hrs, left in a corridor after being violently sick in the waiting area due to the pain I was in, and by being sat down when I suffered the most pain by sitting. The staff in A&E were very defensive and rude when asking a general question about having some pain relief, or when I would be seen, explaining the pain I was experiencing being sat on the chair etc and I needed to lie flat. I was eventually taken into the treatment, 9+hrs later I lay on the bed without a blanket (it was so cold) and no pain relief for hours.  \r\nI finally saw a doctor who was amazing. Checked me over and booked me in for an MRI for the following morning. I wasn’t offered any water or food before my cutoff time for fasting. I was left alone the entire night and following morning in the treatment room.  \r\nMorning came and it was time for my MRI. I got to x-ray department and I struggled to get off the chair as I hadn’t been giving any pain relief. I was back out and had to wait on a doctor to come and give me some morphine to allow me to move and get up onto the table to proceed with the MRI. I was then told straight after my MRI what my results were and was told time was critical and I would be taken to Ward 12 and an emergency ambulance will be arranged to take me straight to Edinburgh Royal DCN to undergo emergency surgery.  \r\nB12 was absolutely ridiculous, they didn’t have my bed ready and I was left to sit on a chair within the ward for a while. Once my bed was ready I got into it and was told by my consultant what was happening next, which was the emergency transfer to Edinburgh.  \r\nIn the meantime, I asked to use the toilet as I hadn’t been in over almost 20 hrs, but I wasn’t allowed out of bed. I was offered a bed pan. Staff didn’t protect my dignity and were very unprofessional. I struggled to use the bed pan due to not being able to feel any parts of my body from my waist down. I explained I couldn’t feel the bed pan or feel I even needed to go. I was worried I would wet the bed. The staff nurse told me it would be very degrading if I happened to do that and the bed would need changed, etc. I was taken back by their comment. I asked them to removed the pan and I would just leave it and wait till I got to Edinburgh.  \r\nI felt so violated and my dignity ripped away from me. Now I was still in B12 until 11 a.m.-5.45 p.m. Time was against me! What happened to the emergency ambulance transfer? I then overheard the paramedics talking to the staff when they were here to collect me asking if I was large, which I’m not, but to overhear professionals talk like this was appalling!  \r\nThe condition I have meant there was a key moment of having surgery which was 24-48 hrs. Having out of hours, A&E and B12 delay all of this really has had a huge impact on my recovery. Where is patient care? Where was the compassion and understanding of patients worry and fear?  \r\nWhile I fully appreciate all units are understaffed, the basic patient care was lacking massively. This will sadly be a time of my life I won’t ever forget, and I just wish A&E, Out of Hours and B12 had a lot more compassion for what they do.","criticality":"moderately

Waiting time in A&E wasn’t too bad, and I was triaged by a nurse who told me I was to go to the surgical receiving ward ( I believe this is ward 4).  \r\nI was then left in the corridor on a porter chair in A&E for over an hour, waiting on a porter to take me to the ward. Multiple members of staff walked by me asking what I was doing there because it was odd I was just abandoned. Eventually someone called for a porter again as they think I had been missed & I finally got taken to a ward.  \r\nOn arrival to the ward, there were no staff around, and so the porter just told me to sit in a bed and let the nurse know I’m here whenever they appear. The porter then left. I sat for over an hour without anybody appearing - not a nurse , a doctor, a CSW, nobody around to even say hello to. Bear in mind, I had been up all night screaming in agonising pain, and while the pain had settled now, I was not offered pain relief & not one single person asked how I was.  \r\nEventually, a student nurse arrived to do my obs and my admission paperwork, but halfway through got called away by a nurse to get something for them. This student was behind the curtain with me doing my admission, I felt this was unprofessional of the nurse to interrupt them for something trivial. I was then left again for 2/3 hours, not a nurse about to ask what was happening. I didn’t know if the doctors would come round, or was I waiting on a scan or bloods.  \r\nAt this point I was so frustrated on the phone to my partner crying , I was so tired and sore and scared. A nurse saw me upset and didn’t even come to ask if I was OK, just stared at me and then left. I have never been in a hospital as a patient before and all I wanted was someone to explain what was happening. All I needed was someone to say hello and explain what I was waiting for. Finally a nurse arrived and took my bloods and so I waited for the results.  \r\nWhen a doctor finally arrived, they said my bloods were fine and they didn’t suspect appendicitis but something gynae related. They took my gynae history, which is when I explained I had experienced this pain multiple times before and so I didn’t think it was my appendix, to which they asked whether I thought it was partly my fault this hasn't been dealt with before. I have been to multiple GPs and had scans previously for this pain, but nobody can seem to get to the bottom of it, so I felt this was extremely rude and insensitive to a young girl who is clearly distressed after experiencing the most traumatic day.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-12-01T11:13:27.39","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-12-01T13:01:24.263","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lanarkshire","count":3}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1003360?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1003360"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1003360/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1003360"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1003360/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1003360"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1003360/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1003360"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l106h_100?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"L106H_100","score":1},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l106h_180?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"L106H_180","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frustrated?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"frustrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scared?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"scared"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appendicitis?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"appendicitis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appendix?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"appendix"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gynae?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"gynae"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/insensitive?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"insensitive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain%20relief?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"pain relief"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professionalism?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"professionalism"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/rudeness?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"rudeness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/student%20nurse?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"student nurse"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/traumatised?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"traumatised"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1004740?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1004740"}]},{"id":1002455,"author":"smn95","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Acorn Centre - tongue tie assessment unit","body":"I was having trouble bottle feeding my three week old - as this clinic normally looks at breastfed babies I wasn't sure how my issue would be handled.

The ward staff were lovely and very attentive, however if I had one complaint was in the night, I was very tired so I buzzed for some support with feeding and they took a long time to come and when the lady did arrive. She told me just take my baby to the breast and she left and as a new breast feeder and new mum I was a little taken back by this, so I sat with baby a bit lost if I'm honest.  \r\nThe next day, I had a midwife Hannah and she was just as lovely as the girl the day before. I spoke to her about my feeding, and she gave me lots of good advice and put me forward to the infant feeding team, I thought great. I then met the lovely Amy who was so lovely, she spoke about hand expressing which I was completely useless at but got me going, and I felt so confident and positive, sadly it was the end of her shift, but she gave me that first little confidence boost, which was so very needed.  \r\nThe night-time came and again I felt extremely scared, she wasn't feeding still and again I buzzed for support this time a lady (no name showing) and physically put my baby on, given my little girl fed but there was no help given really, I felt as if I was disturbing them, so that was the 'quick solution'. Next day I was eager for home but my midwife Hannah again suggested some help again from the infant feeding team, this time I seen Tyler, she was also lovely, she sat with me during a feed and really boosted my confidence, I expressed that I felt a bit uncomfortable with the position I was using which was rugby ball, so she introduced me to the laid back, never heard of this before but gave me so much freedom and allowed me to really relax and enjoy my feeding. They really made me feel heard with my feeding, the night staff over my stay I feel just gave the 'can't be bothered' attitude which is a shame really because the day staff were the complete opposite.  \r\nOverall my stay was really positive and I can't thank the Ashgrove girls and the feeding team enough, you really are all angels!!","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-11-29T21:23:03.7166667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-12-01T13:12:40.053","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Grampian","count":8}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1002609?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1002609"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1002609/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1002609"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1002609/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1002609"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1002609/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1002609"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/n161h_501?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"N161H_501","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scared?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"scared"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breast?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"breast"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breast%20feeding?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"breast feeding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/labour?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"labour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/night%20care?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"night care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support%20with%20feeding?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"support with feeding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ward%20midwives?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Ward Midwives"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/well%20informed?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"well informed"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1007175?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1007175"}]},{"id":1002830,"author":"Baby Jack","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"I felt I had arrived at a five star luxury birth spa","body":"We arrived in ninewells on a Sunday for an induction.

She was advised to be at Outpatients for noon the day before her operation. Staff there were very helpful and friendly and the whole pre-op process was very slick and efficient.  \r\nUnfortunately, she was advised at 15:00 that there were no beds on her Ward, 102, so she would need to spend the night in a Day Procedure Unit. She was then moved to a TV room within the ward to wait until the day patients were away, which eventually was not until 19:00.  \r\nDuring this time, I waited with her as she was extremely anxious about the operation, and not helped by all the uncertainty of where she would spend the night. During our wait she was offered the last and only meal, which turned out to be cold curry with under-cooked rice.  \r\nAt around 18:00 I asked a ward nurse if she knew roughly when my mum would be taken to a bed, and was advised grumpily that they were not a Band 6, so wouldn't be getting involved. I am sure the same message could have been communicated in much more friendly and professional manor.  \r\nThe operation went ahead and I would like to say that both the surgeon, the anaesthetist and the HDU staff were great, sadly after that is where the standards fell considerably.  \r\nDuring my mum's time on Ward 102, when she asked for help with anything, she was regularly advised that they were short-staffed so would need to wait - often the help never materialised or she had to wait over 2 hours including when she was in a soiled bed. Sadly, very little care or compassion was shown during her 4-day stay.  \r\nGenerally, the standard of food was exceptionally poor, meaning that she either felt hungry of her family had to take food in for her.  \r\nWe hope that staff understand the impact these negative experiences have on someone who is recovering following surgery.","criticality":"moderately

Thankfully I followed the recommendation and I was diagnosed with the cancer. I had the Prostate removed by Robotic Keyhole Surgery in February this year. The Perth & Dundee Urology Team were tremendous throughout, explaining procedures, answering questions and being kind and supportive. Graham, the specialist nurse, was particularly kind, and helpful throughout, helping me through a very difficult time in my life. All went well and I have been in good health since.  \r\nAfter a blood test at my local health practice I was recommended to get a Colonoscopy and I had this done at Ninewells in Dundee at the end of November. As before I was more than a little concerned about the procedure and outcome. The team at the Ninewells Colonoscopy Unit were very kind and helpful and the procedure went very smoothly and happily I had no discomfort afterwards.

As a family we were very disappointed in the level of basic nursing care provided; this included personal care and response to buzzers. Whilst an inpatient there was no offer of support for a shower or even provision of a basin to allow for a wash and shave by the bed side when not feeling well enough to mobilise to bathroom. Sheets were left unchanged on occasions unless done so by family. Orders for meals varied hugely at times a meal was said to have been declined, this happened on one occasion when the patient was sleeping but in fact a family member put a request in. If the same family member was not there the following day lunch would not have been provided. This is basic care that should be provided at a high standard at all times.  \r\nWhen admitted to a ward it is important that patients can contact staff at all times, therefore a buzzer system is in place. Our experience of the use of buzzer is disappointing. It was often turned off without a response by the ward staff, messages for pain relief were not passed on to nursing staff and requests for assistance to mobilise to the bathroom were ignored. Often assistance was required due to medical equipment being connected or waiting to be disconnected all outwith patient control.  \r\nThere is a huge emotional impact being an inpatient at the Beatson, basic care and words of reassurance go a long way in supporting families and ensuring patients are at ease during their stay, unfortunately this was not our families’ experience with the Beatson.  \r\nOn the contrary medical care was of a high standard and were very caring and compassionate. We met a senior nurse who also portrayed these values of care and compassion.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-11-30T10:47:42.4733333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-12-01T13:32:05.333","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":10},{"name":"NHS Western Isles","count":4}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1002864?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1002864"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1002864/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1002864"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1002864/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1002864"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1002864/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1002864"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/g517h-ward-b4?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"G517H-ward-b4","score":2},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disappointed?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/food?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"food"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medical%20care?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"medical care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nursing%20care?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"nursing care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/patient%20care?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"patient care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/personal%20care?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"personal care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/senior%20nurse?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"senior nurse"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/buzzer%20system?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"buzzer system"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1003426?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1003426"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1005370?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1005370"}]},{"id":1002936,"author":"mattyinnorth","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"6 week course of immunotherapy hayfever","body":"Immunotherapy hayfever;  \r\nThey started the process by checking vitals before and after injection, this was done by checking for blood pressure heart, peak flow meter, and body temperature.

Covid. I had to go up to emergency PRI on Boxing Day. I had all the Covid symptoms breathing, crackling lungs, throat. Given inhaler. Lost voice for 6 weeks. Months later noticed left ear hearing very poor. It went from hearing to muffled hearing. Referred to PRI ENT twice and Ninewells once. Each time told by reception they had no knowledge of appointment, yet I’m standing there with appointment letter. The ENT Head Nurse felt sorry for me and took me into ENT to see my left Ear on Computer. They said I had a blocked Eustachian Tube and would emergency refer me to PRI ENT.  \r\nAt the time I was told all PRI phone calls go via Kings Cross Dundee before being transferred on to PRI.  \r\nBy this time it’s 2018/19. I went to PRI ENT - the consultant who took a 5 second look in my ear and told me it was my age. He was so disinterested. I was only 68ish. I was gobsmacked! Shellshocked! I went home and thought about it. I was going to complain, but the Covid pandemic started and so I just left things.  \r\nI’ve had ear trouble since 5 when schools regularly health checked. It took the fifth Consultant at the old Dundee Royal Infirmary to realise I went deaf whenever I had a sniffle. The late wonderful Mr Brennan, Head of ENT operated on both my perforated ear drums with huge success in the 1970’s. I attended ENT annually until Mr Brennan retired so I know procedures extremely well. PRI seemed to stop doing annual ear checks on perforations.  \r\nNow Covid is controlled so I phoned my GP surgery to try and get a referral to Ninewells ENT. Unfortunately GPs will not see patients so I’m waiting for a GP to call me at the start of December.  \r\nMeanwhile I got a free hearing test at “Hidden Hearing.” Excellent hour of tests and information. Yes my left ear is poor, but my perforation operations are first class. However I am not paying several thousand pounds for hearing aids. I’m hearing well, though obviously fairly poor in left ear. I want to find out about this left ear and blocked Eustachian Tube.  \r\nMight I say I have always had first class service from all the Nurses, Doctors and Consultants at PRI every area I’ve ever had to go too. I’ve been visiting ENT since I was 5  \r\nDuring the Covid Pandemic I accidentally tripped over my garden pond stones. I was in agony with my left ribs. I contacted my surgery and after speaking to a GP he asked me to come into the surgery. From there he thought I might have broken a rib and told me he’d ask for me to be X-rayed. A couple of weeks later he phoned me to say PRI didn’t want to give me an X-Ray? I bow to their superior knowledge.  \r\nI think there is just so much pressure in Hospitals, I quite understand. I love my NHS and all the work you do. Thank you.  \r\nSo that’s my story.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-11-30T10:45:44.3966667","progress":"Story has a
