This has been particularly important right now at a time of transition. We are so appreciative of everyone’s support.  \r\nMy son would not be the boy he is today without the support of each therapist. Throughout covid several supported his therapy over Nearme. His SALT, Jenny, held weekly sessions to progress his communication and feeding. His Dietician, Caroline, kept a very close eye on his weight and was a huge support during an extremely worrying time.  \r\nOnce covid restrictions lifted Morag, his physio, came swimming with us to teach us how to deliver hydrotherapy. And Tracey, Assistant OT Practitioner, has worked so hard with our son and the whole family since he was months old. She has brought out the best in him. He adores her and she has been an incredible support to us all.

My husband is having tests for cancer after finding 2 lumps in unusual places from the GP. He has had high BP for the past 3 days and we were advised by our own GP if it's constant for 3 days to seek more medical advice. Which we did this morning when my husband's BP went to 184/125!  \r\nUpon arrival at urgent walk-in care, we were greeted by a member of staff who was aggressive and quiet frankly rude because I was with my husband. I explained due to my husband having learning disabilities I needed to be with him when he's speaking to someone as he doesn't understand. After agreeing it was OK for me to stay, as soon as he was called in another member of staff stopped me from entering and following my husband. Again I explained, only this time the member of staff was rude and refused to let me in! After his obs was done 4 TIMES due to how high his BP was, he was then referred urgently to A&E!  \r\nWe waited an hour to be seen (fair enough, I get they're busy).  \r\nTo then have to have my husband sit in a corridor with around 9 other patients, all told to get their arms out ready for BP to be done again, which quite frankly again I was disgusted with how lack of dignity all these patients was receiving!  \r\nWe finally went in to see a nurse, who was more interested in talking out the door to another doctor, openly talking about other patients directly in front of us! They were rude, unhelpful and uncaring. Everything we told them about my husband waiting on cancer tests and scans and his high blood pressure and dizzy spells and being told to go straight to A&E to get seen,they took it on theirself to huff and moan about how it's a GP matter and how we shouldn't be in A&E. Even though we were referred there! The nurse made us feel so unwelcome, and how rude they were I was fuming by the time we left the room. They were very unprofessional and rude.  \r\nWe were then transferred to upstairs same day emergency care. Again, having to explain my husband has learning difficulties so I'd like to stay with him so I can fully understand what's being said as my husband won't. To then have yet another RUDE member of staff kick me out the department and told me to wait downstairs!  \r\nSo I then had to leave my sick husband with very high hypertensive stage 3 blood pressure on his own to attempt to explain to a doctor what's been going on (which he physically won't be able to do).  \r\nI'm beyond angry with the way they have treated him and me. And we still haven't had any care of dignity throughout the entire experience. My husband is still waiting on a doctor to see him!","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-01-19T13:34:52.8833333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-01-20T08:44:40.287","readBy":[{"name":"The Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1019782?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1019782"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1019782/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1019782"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1019782/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1019782"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1019782/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1019782"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rl403_180?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"RL403_180","score":1},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/angry?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"angry"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/a&e?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"a&e"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cancer?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"cancer"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/high%20blood%20pressure?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"high blood pressure"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/high%20bp?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"high BP"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/learning%20difficulties?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"learning difficulties"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/listening?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"listening"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professionalism?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"professionalism"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attitude?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"staff attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tests?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"tests"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dignity?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Dignity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unwelcome?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"unwelcome"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20treated?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"not treated"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1022517?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1022517"}]},{"id":1019792,"author":"virgomum77","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Cannot fault anything","body":"I fell in early December and broke my wrist.

The nursing staff on ward are also wonderful and they try their best to get patients' needs!","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-01-19T18:13:00.77","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-01-20T10:26:41.6","readBy":[{"name":"Southern Health and Social Care Trust","count":3}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1019908?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1019908"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1019908/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1019908"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1019908/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1019908"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1019908/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1019908"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_32024-3n?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"ZT003_32024-3n","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctors?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"doctors"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/elderly?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"elderly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professionalism?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"professionalism"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/well%20looked%20after?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"well looked after"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"amazing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassionate?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"compassionate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wonderful?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"wonderful"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1024319?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1024319"}]},{"id":1019910,"author":"hekahb95","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Orthopedic Ward","body":"I came into this ward roughly 3 days ago and so far everything has been very good.

I used to work up to 60 hours a week, now I’m sitting in front of the TV and every day feels like 60 hours! I feel like Covid has stolen my life from me, my health, my friends, and might even take my job from me later this year. It’s put a strain on my marriage, as my wife’s life has changed in many ways too, she looks after me before she does anything else.  \r\nA year later I’m still on oxygen and left with a number of other health concerns. I’m not bed ridden, I’m not housebound, but a day out for me at the minute is me walking round Tesco with my wife and the oxygen bottle in the trolley. It makes me feel sad when I know where I was and were I am now.  \r\nI got discharged from hospital, I was seen by the respiratory nurse a couple of times. She referred me to have a chat with somebody and I was lucky enough to get Elaine.  \r\nI am so thankful for speaking to Elaine! I couldn’t thank her enough! She put my mind at rest, she put names to things that I was going through like delirium, I didn’t know what it was till I spoke to her. I had nobody to talk to, it seemed no one understood. I was feeling anxious, frustrated, confused and frightened. I couldn’t see the light at the end of the tunnel. When I was in hospital I felt I had a big safety net, when I got home I didn’t have that.  \r\nTalking to Elaine helped to put my mind at rest so many times. She was able to tell me other people were going through similar things, this reassured me I wasn’t on my own. When I told her I thought I was on boats, in war zones, etc with delirium she was able to tell me other people had experience of that too. Elaine is very good at what she does, there were times were I laughed and cried. I wanted someone to help untangle the knot I had in my head, she mightn’t have untangled it fully but she loosened it. She was wonderful, I couldn’t sing her praises high enough.  \r\nI still can see faces and visualise people who I think were looking after me in ICU, due to delirium these people might not even exist because I never actually saw their faces: they were masked up. I can only remember one name: Oran. I don’t know who he was. I would like to go to ICU and meet the people who did so much for me, (they saved my life) and say thank you.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-01-19T17:01:17.0766667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-01-20T10:30:50.667","readBy":[{"name":"Northern Health and Social Care Trust","count":10}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1019844?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1019844"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1019844/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1019844"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1019844/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1019844"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1019844/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1019844"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt002-chpplcs?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"zt002-chpplcs","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt002-cmp-post-covid?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"zt002-cmp-post-covid","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/delirium?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"delirium"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/empathy?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"empathy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassurance?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"reassurance"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"supported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thankful?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Thankful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/long%20covid?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"long covid"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%2019?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"covid 19"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/post%20covid%20syndrome?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"post covid syndrome"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1023456?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1023456"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1024346?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1024346"}]},{"id":1019846,"author":"Service User FV","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Responsive, professional, patient-centred care","body":"This is general feedback for our local practice.

Easier to hold if one knows it will be your turn soon. Very responsive, professional, patient-centred care offered.  \r\nI would like to specifically mention Dr Mitchell, who in my experience and that of family members is extremely thorough, patient-centred, efficient, professional, respectful and friendly too.  \r\nThe practice also offers Well Person appointments for those who wish to be more proactive about their health. An early intervention/prevention approach, helping patients as well as hopefully saving NHS resource - i.e. by dealing with potential issues before they become more serious and have higher resource implications.  \r\nThe NHS is expected to operate within finite resources, not knowing who is going to walk through their doors with what ailment.

I had been out of work a few years so was not hopeful, but then Debbie came along. I was very negative about mental health service I have experienced over the years and did not want to take my tablets, I honestly thought she would be just in it for a job and did not care.  \r\nI was very wrong, the first thing she did is give me a talking to, which I needed, she was gentle with the talking to. But she said if I was to continue not working with my nurse and not taking my tablets, then what in fact would change. I don't want to make Debs sound harsh, as she was not, but she was very honest. Debs motivated me to change, she supported me at jobs fairs, which previously due to my anxiety would not have been possible, she supported me in my claim for pip, she did a CV, she helped me see I was not a write-off, still not sure how she did it.  \r\nI did take my tablets and worked with my nurse and doctor, and things did start to improve, not perfect but getting better. I still have up days and down and dark days, but due to the job I got in a school with Deb it allowed me to feel I have some use. I am just finishing up as my circumstances mean I am also becoming a paid carer for my dad, which Deb also supported me to get.  \r\nI would recommend this lady, she has been more proactive in my getting better from all the mental health illness than any qualified nurse. Even if you think you can't do it, Debbie's down to earth, balanced attitude will help, so ask your nurse or doctor.

It's appalling.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2023-01-20T11:00:15","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-01-20T13:04:33","readBy":[{"name":"Gastroenterology Department, Queen's Medical Centre","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1020155?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1020155"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1020155/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1020155"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1020155/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1020155"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1020155/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1020155"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rx1ra?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"RX1RA","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appalling?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"appalling"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1020417?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1020417"}]},{"id":1019958,"author":"Rosie51","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"I was comfortable throughout the whole process","body":"I was attending to have a biopsy and CT scan to confirm my cancer in preparation of a potential chemo course.  \r\nI was looked after very well from arrival, greeted by Lucy, who looked after me throughout, and the doctor performing the biopsy was brilliant, he took great care and ensured I was comfortable throughout the whole process.  \r\nI even left a bit earlier than I expected to go home.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-01-19T20:47:33.7533333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-01-20T13:05:04.727","readBy":[{"name":"Royal Devon University Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust","count":5},{"name":"Royal Devon University Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust (2)","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1019958?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1019958"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1019958/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1019958"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1019958/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1019958"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1019958/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1019958"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rh880-radiology?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"RH880-radiology","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/biopsy?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"biopsy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cancer?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"cancer"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/chemo?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"chemo"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ct?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"CT"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ct%20scan?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"CT scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/level%20of%20care?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"level of care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scan?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting%20time?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"waiting time"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/well%20looked%20after?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"well looked after"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/comfortable?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"comfortable"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1020843?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1020843"}]},{"id":1019930,"author":"sculptordx79","authorRoleId":3,"authorRole":"a parent/guardian","title":"Her struggle is getting harder each day","body":"My daughter was given help at the Cullen centre October 2021.

Eventually I was transferred from orthopaedic care to the vascular team. I saw Mr Siddiqui and my amputation was done.I don't really know where to go next with this story except to say what fabulous care I received from the vascular team. Mr Sayed performed the surgery and everything seems to have gone well. And what a beautiful neat scar I have! I was very impressed. Thank you!  \r\nThe staff nurse caring for me in recovery (sorry I can't remember her name) was lovely. She was with me for ages while I waited for a bed in the ward. The staff nurses and CSW's on Ward 8 in Hairmyres were so kind. Nothing was a bother for them. I knew they were busy, but they never seemed rushed. They were all so encouraging and supportive.The domestics were also very kind. And who says hospital food isn't tasty? I enjoyed all my meals, and my little bits of cake with my tea. And I enjoyed the chat when they had time. And one of the domestics who cleaned my room had a lovely singing voice, he was lovely to listen to.A big shout out also has to go to the physio, Lyndsey, the OT Jill, and OT assistant Sam. They were amazing at helping me get started on the right path towards rehabilitation, making sure I'd be safe before being discharged home. Having a below knee amputation was the best healthcare decision I've ever made. I've been pretty much pain free since the turn of the new year. Being without pain for that length of time is unusual for me. I really appreciate everyone who respected my choice for this surgery and I'm so glad it has worked out well. I put this down to the fabulous care I received from the whole vascular team and the positive support and encouragement they gave me.

Whilst still away I contacted my GP practice to arrange a follow-up to replace the cast. RD&E responded the following day with an appointment for the day after my return. The team at the fracture clinic advised that surgery would provide me with a much more effective outcome than just replacing the cast. As a trauma injury surgery was organised for the following day. This efficiency alone was amazing given the media reports of a struggling NHS. But my praise is for the two dozen or so members of the teams I saw who all demonstrated such kindness, efficiency, support, understanding and humour over the two days. There was no sense of rush or impatience. Procedures were clearly explained and I experienced brilliant care all the way. Thank you all so much.

Sadly the refurb fails to take into account patients that may need to stay in for a week or more like those with CF and Bronchiectasis. It falls way short of the facilities found in other CF wards such as Heartlands and The Brompton. You are unable to see out of the windows now which is incredibly depressing for patients but I presume also the staff, especially knowing how incredible and healing the views were before, so important to both mental and physical wellness. The rooms are tiny and very claustrophobic, there is nowhere to put your clothes and other belongings, There are no TVs... fine if you have access to a laptop but not everyone has this privilege...the bathrooms have no shelves, hooks or storage so any toiletries etc have to go on the floor or balance on the bin. Other CF wards have room for exercise equipment in the rooms, not a chance of that here. There is also no access to a microwave or small kitchen, again essential for CF patients especially when the food is pretty poor, the CF menu sadly was dreadful. The ward has clearly been designed for acute respiratory patients with no thought or consultation involving those with long term conditions like CF or the professionals that care for them. Were any patients consulted during the design?? It feels as though it has been designed purely for medical practicality for acute scenarios, without a thought for the holistic needs of chronic long term patients. As a CF patient I felt as though I was in a standard respiratory ward, which is something CF care has moved away from over the last decades due to our complex need and repeated lengthy admissions. I hope there can be a resolution but I presume this cost a fortune to refurb, it just feels like a terribly wasted opportunity to not have incorporated a designated CF section.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2023-01-20T11:24:27","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2023-01-20T13:29:56","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1020177?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1020177"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1020177/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1020177"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1020177/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1020177"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1020177/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1020177"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rth08?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"RTH08","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/balance?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"balance"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cf?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"CF"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/claustrophobic?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"claustrophobic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/exercise?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"exercise"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/respiratory?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"respiratory"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hope?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Hope"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"put off"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dreadful?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"dreadful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fine?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"fine"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/no%20hope?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"no hope"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/in%20the%20way?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"in the way"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/under%20pressure?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"under pressure"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/like%20myself?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"like myself"}]},{"id":1020180,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Diligent service ","body":"After many years of putting off this appointment,  finally made one & was very impressed by the time & care I was allocated.

The response was really great, we were contacted the next morning, and an initial visit by a doctor was held that day. He was given a thorough examination, and the doctor came with a selection of antibiotics, and we were given a course to start - this was fantastic that we didn't have to go to the chemist to pick up the tablets as I did not like going out and leaving dad in the house on his own.  \r\nOver the next approx 2 weeks, we received about 6 or 7 visits from the team. The most significant was when dad was very distressed, struggling to breathe and having some seizures - I called at approx 4:45 pm, and despite the team officially stopping work at 5 pm, they agreed to call in, and a doctor and nurse practitioner were here until well after 7 pm - we were so grateful, as without them we would undoubtedly have ended up calling 999, and he would have been taken to A&E, who knows how long he would have waited to be seen, and admission would have been even more distressing for him.  \r\nThe whole concept of care-in-the-home is really fantastic, and hopefully the new DECS-A team gets the support and funding it requires to continue to flourish and provide a fantastic service in the Dundee area. Many thanks from us to Drs Din & Flatt, and to nurses Lesley and Jane.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-01-20T09:00:12.29","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-01-20T13:36:28.75","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Tayside","count":4}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1020052?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1020052"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1020052/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1020052"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1020052/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1020052"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1020052/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1020052"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/t107h_430?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"T107H_430","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/above%20and%20beyond?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"above and beyond"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/antibiotics?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"antibiotics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/chest%20infection?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"chest infection"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/elderly?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"elderly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fast%20response?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Fast response"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/out%20of%20hours?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"out of hours"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"supported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/decs-a?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"decs-a"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1020957?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1020957"}]},{"id":1020178,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Excellent service","body":"I have been receiving treatment for an eye condition at Moorfields Eye hospital since Aug 2021, which was when the surgery checked me for high blood pressure cholesterol & diabetes which can the cause of my eye condition.

I  called for a follow up appointment due to some test I recently done and was told no apponitment is issued any more I have to called on the day for same day appointment. I have been trying at 8am and when it get to my turn no appointment available.From December to now. My last experience was this morning 20.01.2023 . I called at 7.53am line closed and you cannot hold on the phone. At exactly 8.00am I called shocking I was 14th in the queue how did that happened. By the time the receptionist got to me no appointment not only my Dr but to any Dr. I was told to called emergency Dr or111. How does that help the flow of patient have at the hospital as GP has to see patient in order to reduce on  the hospital. This system of yours is totally absurd and not working in the favour of patient. A GP practice becomes as a family DR and they know you and your health history. If an appointment was given to me as before I would already been seen by my Dr because its already been four weeks there is no common sense in thois system. Its in the fabvour of the surgery not patients. I have been with this surgery since 1983.

She had fallen at 6:30 pm and her personal alarm had alerted the first response team to a neighbour who had spare keys, then let in, when the alarm company came to her assistance. They called an ambulance at 6:45 pm and when I got to the Glasgow flat, my friend was still face down on the floor and moaning in pain.  \r\nThe team went home, and I rang 999 again and was reassured an ambulance would be there within the hour. A good team arrived at 9:50 pm, and eventually we got my friend onto a chair that they wheeled to the ambulance. We were warned we might wait outside the Queen Elizabeth Hospital Glasgow for up to six hours, as that was the current waiting time. However, someone was looking out for us, as we got a paramedic bay within 10 mins and then an A&E bay in the next 5 mins.  \r\nMy friend was given help by Dr Woo, who ordered a MRI scan for her head and an x-ray for her broken arm. My friend was vomiting every time someone touched her arm, but she was given first class service, assessment and care. The nurses, doctors on duty, and orderlies involved showed outstanding care, warmth, compassion, positive energy and kindness. I was very impressed.  \r\nHer arm was put in plaster, every concern my friend was able to articulate was listened to and they also showed me enormous courtesy and politeness. My friend was fortunate again and found a bed on the medical ortho ward on floor ten by 4 am. I was allowed to go up with my friend, just to carry her bag and be there - we have only known each other for four years as friends, not close but her other friends were away/on holiday, etc, so I was fourth on the contact list.  \r\nI left and got a taxi at 4:15 am. I came back on Saturday afternoon and my friend was OK - operated on and is now in respite. Jim and Jamie from Kirkintilloch ambulance station were outstanding in their care, and also Alan who wheeled Jacqueline to floor 10 was amazing. Thank you so much to the staff that night and morning and Dr Woo, and others we met who were just so nice.  \r\nMy friend kept being sick from the pain, and the morphine which she may have been allergic to - and I have not been exposed to a situation like that before but we were both constantly reassured throughout the ordeal. I have lived in Glasgow for 30 years and was so glad to be among Glaswegians on that night. Thank you.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-01-19T23:14:11.29","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-01-20T13:57:45.12","readBy":[{"name":"Scottish

I hadn’t been under general anaesthetic since I was a small child and I didn’t remember this properly, so I was terrified of what was going to happen with the anaesthetic.  \r\nI communicated this with my nurses and the doctors and they explained to me everything that was going to happen, and explained how rare complications are from general nowadays, especially for younger, fitter people. A nurse called Emma and a nurse called Katie in particular sat with me in the waiting room before I went into the operating theatre and really helped to calm my nerves. I don’t know if I would have gone through with the day without the help and support of the nurses, and for that I am very grateful.  \r\nAs for the procedure, it seemed to go very well. I woke up in the recovery room and then was taken over to a ward for observation, which had to be a little longer than it would be normally as during the months leading up to this procedure we had discovered that I had a mild factor 11 deficiency, so the doctors and nurses just wanted to make sure everything was fine and safe. They also prescribed me a blood clotting agent.  \r\nI am on day 2 of recovery and so far have had very little pain, just the expected discomfort. My mouth had stopped bleeding entirely by yesterday evening and now I am just taking over the counter painkillers and eating a soft diet for a few days. I am very happy with the treatment I received and would like to thank everyone who dealt with me for treating me with compassion and respect. It was a hard place to be when I was scared, but the staff made it a lot easier.
