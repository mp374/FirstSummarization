This was a very difficult time for our family but the Kilbryde staff helped us make the best of our time. My mum adored every one of the staff and often said how safe she felt in their care. The staff are professional yet at the same time they really did feel like family.  \r\nEven with lockdown restrictions in place the hospice did everything they could to support safe visits which was amazing after not seeing my mum for 2 months after she was in hospital during lockdown.  \r\nThe hospice staff organised so many meaningful events for us to create special memories like a movie night and birthday celebrations. In my mums last week of care we celebrated the birth of her granddaughter. The staff made this feel like such a special time for us all and I was so glad my mum got to meet her before she passed away.  \r\nWe will never be able to repay the care received to my mum, but we will always be so grateful and continue to support the hospice.  \r\nAlthough they could not change the outcome, they really did affect the journey. Thank you all so much x","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-09-07T10:12:28.6533333","progress":"Story has a

2 skin cancers removed from my nose 4 years ago and luckily this was done in Guys.  \r\nIn October 2021, my GP referred me to Basildon Hospital Dermatologist for a suspected skin cancer on my nose and back.  \r\nI attended a dermatology appointment via Basildon Hospital Dermatology Dept in January 2022. The dermatologist confirmed it looks like 2 skin cancers on my nose and also the lesion on my back. She said both on my nose must be done in Basildon Hospital as it’s the face and the one on my back can be removed in the clinic.  \r\nIn March 2022, I attended Rayleigh Clinic and had the one on my back removed. I asked the surgeon to do a biopsy of the 2 on my face but he said he would not be allowed to do this.  \r\nI complained to PALS as the 2 I had removed by Guys was completed within a couple of weeks from the initial referral. The dermatologist called me up from Basildon Hospital said I had to attend clinic again! In May 2022 I attended to be told the same thing!  \r\nThe dermatologist from Basildon called me up to ask for me to attend clinic in Canvey. I said I was told the 2 on my nose must be done in hospital. They assured me that the plastic surgeon was attending the clinic and was fully capable of removing the lesions.  \r\nI attend the Canvey clinic in August 2022. I was shocked when the surgeon said it was only a biopsy! They said sometimes if they have clear margins, they can remove all of it. They cut 2 chunks out of my face and told me one was 4 stitches and one was 3 stitches. As they was operating on me, the nurse said the surgeon had nicked their finger. They carried on cutting me and never changed the blade! They then said to the nurse that maybe they should change their gloves. The nurse said that they didn't think it had torn the glove.  \r\nWhen the stitches were removed, there was 3 on one side and 2 on the other! This does not inspire confidence in me at all. I was also told it’s an 8 week wait for the biopsy! The stitches are now out and there are no clear margins as he has left part of the lesion still there. I have lost confidence in the hospital completely and they have ignored my messages for a callback and nobody answers and the phone often gets cut off after several rings!","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-09-05T16:01:07.2633333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-09-12T09:20:02.52","readBy":[{"name":"Mid and South Essex NHS Foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/972730?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"972730"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/972730/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"972730"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/972730/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"972730"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/972730/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"972730"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/raj12_330?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"RAJ12_330","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/y04862?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Y04862","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/angry?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"angry"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stressed?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"stressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/biopsy?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"biopsy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/concerned?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"concerned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/depressed?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"depressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dermatology?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"dermatology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/face?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"face"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/follow%20up%20care?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Follow up care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/high%20blood%20pressure?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"high blood pressure"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/infection?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"infection"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nose?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"nose"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/skin?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"skin"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/skin%20cancer?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"skin cancer"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stitches?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"stitches"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/delays?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"delays"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/974462?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"974462"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/974484?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"974484"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/974511?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"974511"}]},{"id":974071,"author":"HGpreg","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Maternity services FVRH","body":"I have suffered from HG throughout my pregnancy and have been in and out of hospital with dehydration and I am on a range of anti sickness medication. Yesterday I was severely dehydrated, pulsing heart, vomiting, had reduced fetal movement and hadn’t been able to keep anything down for over 24 hours, so phoned mat triage. Unfortunately, it took me 20 mins to get an answers on the phone and then I was put on hold. When my call was finally handled, they couldn’t find me on the system because I’m cross boundary and was told I should be seen but it was a long wait. When arriving at mat triage, the team were very short staffed and busy with the waiting area being standing room only. Due to vomiting, I was moved to another waiting room and was then left for 4 hours before being moved up to the labour ward to be seen, as mat triage had now closed. I then waited another 30 mins to be seen and was finally put on a monitor and was told someone would be with me in a few minutes, however I had to wait another 40 mins before being seen. There was a clear breakdown in communication as the midwives seemed to be confused as to what I was there for, my symptoms, who had my urine sample and what had happened. The midwives were all apologetic and lovely and told me I was severely dehydrated and would likely be kept in. One midwife explained that they had been phoned to start their shift early due to the staffing issues within the department.  \r\nWhen I was finally seen by a doctor, I was told I was dehydrated, had a three plus ketones in my urine and to go home and have a nice meal (I have not been able to eat a meal in months, which I had explained numerous times). The quality of care I have received has been horrendous and there seems to be a lack of understanding around how dangerous, embarrassing and debilitating HG can be. I was left feeling vulnerable, neglected and dreading going into labour.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-09-09T06:27:07.2333333","progress":"Story has a

We laughed lots too and their expertise meant that I left there truly feeling like a different woman.  \r\nWhat a wonderfully positive and affirming experience!  \r\nThank you so much for everything!","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-09-09T14:38:56.65","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-09-12T09:28:04.17","readBy":[{"name":"Office of Alexander Burnett, MSP for Aberdeenshire West","count":1},{"name":"NHS Grampian","count":6},{"name":"Scottish Government","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/974209?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"974209"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/974209/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"974209"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/974209/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"974209"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/974209/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"974209"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/n101h-breast-services?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"N101H-breast-services","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/attentive?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"attentive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breast?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"breast"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breast%20cancer?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"breast cancer"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cancer?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"cancer"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cancer%20treatment?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"cancer treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/empathy?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"empathy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/encouraged?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"encouraged"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/expertise?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"expertise"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helpful?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"helpful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kind?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"kind"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/laughter?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Laughter"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/positive%20experience?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"positive experience"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/respected?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"respected"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/weight?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"weight"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wonderful?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"wonderful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breast%20prosthesis?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"breast prosthesis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you%20so%20much?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"thank you so much"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurtured?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"nurtured"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/974688?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"974688"}]},{"id":974216,"author":"SSweeney94","authorRoleId":1,"authorRole":"a carer","title":"Supporting an individual at day surgery for procedure","body":"Supporting an individual at day surgery for procedure, the person I was supporting felt nervous at the thought of being put to sleep.  \r\nAll of the nurses and doctors had patience in explaining or allowing me to explain in a way to be understood.

then make my way to A&E to have her ankle seen to. I decided to give Clionagh (disability liason nurse) a call to let her know that we were coming to the hospital and ask if we could make use of the sensory room in A&E in order to make the experience less daunting for my daughter.  \r\nClionagh kindly offered to call X-ray and ask them to do both the X-rays while we were there to save a long wait in A&E. They immediately said that they would be happy to help. It was simply a matter of calling our GP to ask them to do the referral.  \r\nClionagh duly called the GP and they were happy to oblige and sent the referral through promptly.  \r\nMy daughters ankle X-ray was done almost immediately and she was treated with kindness and courtesy throughout by all the staff from receptionist to radiographer.  \r\nI went to the hospital prepared to stay for several hours when, in actual fact, we were there for less than an hour!

Especially with postnatal care. For some background to my previous experience, with my first when in labour, I felt the need to push too soon. The staff member with me at the time referred to their senior midwife, who said it's their first baby, they don't know what they're talking about. My baby was stuck and it resulted in urgent action being taken when the doctor came to see how I was getting on. Staff at the time forgot to recheck my bloods after a blood loss and I became very unwell for months because of this and I believe that this caused or was part of the cause of postnatal depression. My second baby, I was almost sent home again without my bloods being checked, even when I kept asking. As I was packing they came in to tell me I needed a blood transfusion. This pregnancy - my third pregnancy and the one this is mainly about - was by far the worst experience. I wanted to have as natural a birth as possible however due to previous weights of my babies, it was a balancing act and resulted in growth scans and frequent hospital appointments to discuss said growth scans. A plan was in place for weeks. At my last visit, this all changed when I was informed that they could not locate my notes from my first birth. Somehow along the way, it had been communicated that something had occurred in my first birth that had not, and which I said had not, but I was advised to book in a c-section because they didn’t have my notes. I refused because it happened to me and I know what occurred and wouldn’t be forced. So I was booked in for an induction after them suggesting I would likely be killing myself and my baby! Their mannerisms were disgusting. This went on for a while longer, no notes, nobody could find them. I went in for my covid swabs and myself and partner were covid positive and so my induction was moved - which at one point had been deemed medically necessary to be carried out at that stage.I complained to the lead clinician after a phone call with a consultant surrounding this which caused a panic attack and having to hand my husband the phone. The consultant was entirely unreasonable and rude. When I made points they agreed but still would not change my date that was cancelled. A point of note - all NHS provided at home COVID tests were negative. So following a complaint to the lead clinician, they then begin to try and locate my notes (my personal data) again and book me back in a couple days later. Some time later, I got a call and my notes had been found. What I had said did not occur, indeed did not and telling me I was risking my life and that of my baby had been entirely uncalled for. The panic and upset that caused was for nothing. Aside from anything else, not having my notes and the NHS not being aware of where these were is a data protection issue as well as being potentially harmful to my health if something had been missed because of not having those notes. I must say, when in for my induction, throughout labour and then the emergency c-section, all staff were fantastic. Those in the operating theatre especially (who by the way had not been told about the previous positive covid test which was discovered when the anaesthesiologist came to check on me on the ward). I had not at any point through labour been treated as covid positive. I was then moved to ward 8 and put in a shared room. I text my husband to tell him where to find me, he arrived and then I was given a mask suddenly and swept away into a private room where we were not told about why we had been moved. My mother in law had visited and left, and my partner went home to check our dogs. At that point a midwife came in and said I could not have visitors, after the fact. I queried about my husband and was told he wouldn’t be able to come back. I was in a locked off private room alone after a section with a newborn, how would anyone feel? My husband called to query and complain. After this, he was allowed back and again we could have visitors if we wanted. The main nursery nurse I had was rude and not at all understanding of the needs of a mother. When my baby was crying and my husband not there one night and I needed help, nobody came and i was not comfortable calling for them. Nobody brought me any water until the morning and I was beyond thirsty and began drinking horrible tasting tap water. A health care assistant at one point entered my room in full PPE and put my crockery and cutlery into a clinical waste bag, throwing it in. In front of me with my newborn present. I have worked for the NHS. This is not acceptable but the staff have denied it occurring. Why would I make this shocking behaviour up? Actually the staff have denied all, including ever placing me in a shared room and claim there is no documentation of this. Apparently it's been noted that we were very happy with the visiting conversations - which we were not. They should have call recordings to this effect. Apparently I was offered support numerous times and this is documented. I'm aware from working in healthcare that some staff document they offered assistance to tick a box when in-fact they did not. I am devastated this happy time was ruined and genuinely feel traumatised by the whole thing. All I want is an apology and for them to recognise where they went wrong and improve for the next mother. I felt like an alien.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-09-10T23:56:15.2433333","progress":"Story has a

Queen Margaret Hospital Dunfermline. I was seen by the On Call Opthalmologist Dr Mair.  \r\nIt didn’t help that I was also in a deal of pain/ limited mobility due to my Rheumatoid Arthritis.  \r\nI cannot thank Dr Mair enough for her care and manner and especially, in light of the confusing symptoms, her way of explaining what may or may not be the way ahead.  \r\nSubsequently, with my sight worsening I have again been seen at short notice by both Dr Mair and her boss Dr Styles. I believe I present as a what’s-going-on-here? patient. Believe me, I do appreciate that if a Consultant can use the word ‘stumped’ but still pull out the stops to identify the causes, I’m in good hands.

There was excellent communication and care from the nursing staff, Junior Doctors and I had quite a few in involved in my care.  \r\nI would also like to highlight the excellent support and care given especially by the health care support workers and those orderlies serving the food. Their attention to detail and to my needs was impeccable despite the many pressures all staff were under.  \r\nMy only disappointment as a Senior Care Assistant was that junior staff failed to understand the different needs of patients. Especially elderly patients with visual impairments, who found it difficult to use their buzzers and often would not get offered drinks because they were never asked .  \r\nIf I could ask for the Lincoln County Hospital to consider their stance on inclusion and how a person with noise sensitivity could be better supported in this situation.","criticality":"mildly

Treated brilliantly by all staff. I was asked to come in early. Arrived and after a few routine questions by staff I was at my bed an hour earlier than my original scheduled appointment time. Was spoken to by Dr Sharma and Dr Li. A full explanation was given on the procedure and the consent forms signed. Taken for surgery.  \r\nBack to my ward later that day and seen by staff and the physio therapist. Given tea and toast. Again spoken to by nurses to confirm I was feeling ok and given painkillers.  \r\nReleased at in the evening with full instructions on post op exercises etc and contact numbers should I feel unwell.  \r\nI received to follow up calls the following day ensuring I was fine, one of which was the local physio therapist to which I’m booked in for 1 week after my op.  \r\nFabulous treatment from all.  \r\nThank you everybody that had an involvement with me at QMH.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-09-10T08:13:35.7166667","progress":"Story has a

Very pleased and proud of all the staff.&nbsp; well done and thank you.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-09-11T10:55:06.1733333","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2022-09-12T13:57:08.967","readBy":[{"name":"Royal Devon University Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust","count":8},{"name":"Royal Devon University Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust (2)","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/974306?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"974306"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/974306/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"974306"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/974306/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"974306"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/974306/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"974306"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rh880_320?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"RH880_320","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazed?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"amazed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cardiology?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"cardiology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cleaner?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"cleaner"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/food?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"food"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pacemaker?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"pacemaker"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professional?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"professional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/brilliant%20care?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"brilliant care"}]},{"id":974262,"author":"eridanuspf43","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Mastectomy operation","body":"I had my mastectomy operation date changed, and that was fine with me, as obviously it’s a case of ‘the sooner, the better with the removal of cancer.  \r\nI was told to attend the day surgery unit in Wishaw General and all the staff were lovely. Very professional and put me at ease.  \r\nIt was the first time I’d met with my surgeon as I’d been on the list for a different surgeon until the date was changed. The surgeon and their team were also fantastic.  \r\nThere was only one thing that detracted from my positive experience of the mastectomy and that is that I had been assured by my original surgeon and two separate breastcare nurses, that I would have support on the ward with the expected body image issues and be given something they refer to as a ‘softie’ or a ‘comfie’ to be placed (with the support of a nurse who’d take my bra measurement and provide the right size) into the newly empty bra cup.  \r\nBecause my operation was done in the day surgery unit, they had no knowledge that a ‘softie’ was required in my case and my only option was to leave the ward feeling very self conscious about my operation and missing breast.  \r\nOne of the nurses was kind enough to fashion a bra filler out of crepe bandage, because my remaining breast is quite large and I genuinely felt uneven and like a bit of a freak.  \r\nObviously the quick fix was okay for the walk to the car, but it wasn’t at all appropriate as a temporary ‘softie’ because it was the wrong density, didn’t fit well and would have aggravated the wound if I left it in situ.  \r\nIt’s very important that the breastcare nurses and day surgery nurses have better communication, so that this doesn’t happen to other people in my position. Aftercare and the provision of advice on bra wearing and a softie after the operation is imperative for the best chance of wound healing and the mental health issues involved with mastectomy.  \r\nYesterday, my body image and perception of myself in relation to my personal relationships was changed forever and I was in a very vulnerable state, so to not have the temporary prosthesis to use wasn’t ideal.  \r\nI’m extremely proactive in trying to heal myself and wanted to follow everything expected of me to the letter, so the fact that nobody had any idea what I was talking about when I asked about a softie for my scar site was saddening.  \r\nI’m now left using a balled up pair of socks which are somewhat like I would imagine a softie to feel like, just so that I can provide support to the wound and the remaining breast, which will hopefully promote healing.  \r\nThe protocol for getting measured for a real prosthetic is commenced after the two week initial wound healing period, so I will now have to call my breastcare nurse on Monday and I expect that she’ll be able to give me the softie I’m relying on to make my son feel less distressed about my operation. I’ve done my best all along to downplay the seriousness of the cancer and treatment because he’s a child, but not having the proper temporary disguise for the missing breast, hasn’t helped. It’s obvious to anyone who looks at me right now that I only have one breast and I was assured by all the pre operative professionals I spoke to that I would not, at any time, have this issue.  \r\nMy breastcare nurse is based in East Kilbride and I live in Airdrie so it’s an inconvenience that was completely avoidable for me, that I now need to get someone to give me a lift through to East Kilbride, to pick up something that was supposed to be provided to me as a standard part of my procedure.  \r\nI wanted to tell you my story, so that you might consider this problem in the case of future mastectomies in the day surgery unit.  \r\nI must reiterate that all the staff were wonderful and it was only after I asked about what to do about my empty bra cup, that their attitude changed a bit .Although I was not in any way complaining or blaming, quite a few nurses started to act defensive and I felt like I was being a nuisance and asking too many questions too, which changed my positive experience a bit.  \r\n, which changed my positive experience a bit.  \r\nI still gave them a card and a couple of boxes of chocolates and thanked them profusely, but my experience would have been GREATLY improved by just not having to feel like a trouble maker for simply asking nicely for the thing that I had been repeatedly told I would be given after the procedure.  \r\nToday I have concerned family members visiting and without the pre planned use of the temporary prosthetic, I feel much less comfortable about putting on the brave face I’m going to put on. I probably didn’t explain that right, but maybe you know what I mean.  \r\nImmediately post op is a make or break time for how people process this process this operation, mentally. I would have benefited greatly from better support.  \r\nThank you for your time and thank you for everything else involved in my diagnosis and treatment.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-09-10T12:33:17.2933333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-09-12T13:57:42.49","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lanarkshire","count":4},{"name":"Scottish Government","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/974262?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"974262"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/974262/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"974262"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/974262/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"974262"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/974262/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"974262"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l106h-day-surgery?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"L106H-Day-Surgery","score":3},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/aftercare?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"aftercare"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bewildered?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"bewildered"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breast?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"breast"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cancer?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"cancer"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cancer%20treatment?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"cancer treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication%20between%20services?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"communication between services"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/day%20surgery?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"day surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diagnosis?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"diagnosis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mastectomy?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"mastectomy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/operation?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"operation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scar?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"scar"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vulnerable?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"vulnerable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wound?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"wound"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wonderful%20staff?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"wonderful staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/post-op%20care?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"post-op care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/like%20a%20nuisance?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"like a nuisance"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/974775?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"974775"}]},{"id":974307,"author":"Anoyt98","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Quick & not so painful","body":"Checked in for my 4th covid vaccine and this years flu vaccine.

I was really buzzing about the chance I had been given to detox and wanted to make it work, I was looking forward to it. I had multiple emotions going on from happiness to huge anxiety and fear. Looking back now my admission was a blur and I just wanted to stay in my room and recluse. The staff supported me through this time and gave me space to ground myself. My treatment was started that day after close monitoring and I felt safe that I was being cared for professionally. My accommodation was clean tidy and tidy, with clean bed linen provided regularly. The food was nice and cooked freshly every day.  \r\nThere have been some negative aspects to my stay for example having to deal with my anxiety and a feeling of claustrophobia to the middle and latter part of my stay. There have been some issues around nightly well being checks and how certain staff did those, but I discussed this with other staff members and the problem was dealt with. Overall my detox was 85% positive and 15% negative but this 15% improved once the issue was addressed.  \r\n","criticality":"minimally critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-09-11T13:23:25.1833333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-09-12T16:22:18.547","readBy":[{"name":"Midlands Partnership NHS Foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/974314?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"974314"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/974314/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"974314"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/974314/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"974314"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/974314/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"974314"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rrex4-inclusion-dcds?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"RREX4-inclusion-dcds","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cleanliness?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"cleanliness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/detox?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"detox"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supportive?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"supportive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/initially%20anxious?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"initially anxious"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/food%20quality?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"food quality"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wellbeing%20checks?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"wellbeing checks"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/improvements%20made?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"improvements made"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/974716?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"974716"}]},{"id":974297,"author":"liberatoref79","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Very good service","body":"I have had 8 appointments at the physiotherapy department and all have been very good.&nbsp;

There were many reasons for this, the main one being having no confidence in myself and not liking me anymore.  \r\nFollowing a referral to inclusion I was extremely dubious & nervous about how this service could help me. I attended the pre counselling course and was surprised to find the many psychological therapies available. I’m not one for group sessions as I don’t like talking about ‘me’ but I found a type of therapy that I felt would tackle the issues I had. My perception was that I would talk about the issues I had and would be told what to do to resolve these.  \r\nI was so wrong…..it was completely different to what I had thought. My therapist was amazing. The thing that stood out the most was the fact he just listened & listened & listened. He never interrupted, he never judged, he offered solace when I became upset, but most of all, he allowed me to be me, a person I never really understood and never felt I belonged. He offered different ways to think and deal with situations, he made me realise I don’t always have to think of a hundred solutions and never find one. I realised I couldn’t change the traumas I had experienced but by giving myself permission to acknowledge my emotions and love myself, this would start my path to having a better relationship with myself. I realise there will still be good & bad days but the therapy I have received has been invaluable and I would encourage anybody to give therapy a chance, no matter what this may entail as working in partnership has certainly helped me tremendously. I can’t thank my therapist enough for the time he has given me to believe in me.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-09-11T06:11:13.54","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-09-13T08:55:15.977","readBy":[{"name":"Midlands Partnership NHS Foundation Trust","count":9},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2022)","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/974290?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"974290"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/974290/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"974290"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/974290/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"974290"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/974290/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"974290"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rrex4-inclusion-thurrock?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"rrex4-inclusion-thurrock","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nervous?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"nervous"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/counselling?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"counselling"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/course?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"course"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/depression?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"depression"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helped?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"helped"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helped%20me?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"helped me"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/listened?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"listened"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/referral?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"referral"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/therapist?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"therapist"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"amazing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thanks?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"thanks"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/self%20love?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"self love"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20judged?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"not judged"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lost%20confidence?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"lost confidence"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/access%20to%20therapies?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"access to therapies"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/invaluable%20service?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"invaluable service"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/self%20belief?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"self belief"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/981291?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"981291"}]},{"id":974338,"author":"weasel","authorRoleId":4,"authorRole":"a relative","title":"My mum had excellent care","body":"My mum was rushed into A&E last week at Croydon University Hospital and received excellent care.

After getting the wax removed at the local chemist, who also raised questions re problems of the type of wax they were removing and after over 6 weeks and no sign of it getting better, I got an appointment within a week of the referral which was a big surprise.  \r\nI was advised, after hearing tests and examination of my ears, that I had a hole in my inner ear due to an infection. This was all done and explained very well and all my questions answered with no problems by a lovely consultant and the staff in his clinic.  \r\nAfter a few weeks my hearing deteriorated very badly once again overnight. Upon calling the ENT department, I was told to come that afternoon to allow them to look at my ears.  \r\nOnce again treated extremely well and everything explained again, and I was referred for a scan to check if there were any further problems that were not being picked up.  \r\nAgain only 2 weeks before I got the scan and only a further 2 weeks before a response about what it had found and that it hadn't shown anything serious or life threatening.  \r\nAgain appt received within 4 weeks with Mr Walker at ENT. I had previously read a report about him that was displayed in the waiting room at ENT, and had commented to my husband that they had made him sound like a saint and that I definitely didn't believe that, possibly because of the experience I had and was still having with a consultant at the same hospital but in another department!  \r\nAt my appointment I found that, OK Mr Walker was not a saint, but wasn't far off it. He is a lovely down to earth person who puts his patients at ease right away and treats them with sympathy and respect and goes through all possibilities in depth and takes your views seriously and again sympathetically.  \r\nIt was agreed he would try grommets to see if this would help and after getting advanced hearing tests and results being received by him within 2 weeks of my original appointment with him, I was in the department getting grommets inserted by him.  \r\nAlthough he had told me very fully what would happen, I was a bit apprehensive as it was being done under local anaesthetic. He was fantastic, explaining what he was going to do and checking when he was doing the procedure that it wasn't too painful and that I was coping OK. It was almost pain-free and I just couldn't believe how caring he was.  \r\nI am 74yrs of age and get very angry at times with some people in the medical profession who make me feel, because of my age, that I am senile and an inconvenience. But at no time did I feel that with anyone at the ENT department. I felt that nothing was a problem with them and that I, the patient, was the most important person at every point.  \r\nHaving a problem with your health is not a great experience but I am left feeling that here was a department that treated their patients with great empathy and understanding. A lot of this I think comes from having a Head of Department who knows how genuinely to show his staff how he appreciates their work, which then spills over to how they treat the patient.  \r\nGreat department and staff xx","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-09-11T22:49:36.2233333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-09-13T09:26:11.58","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Fife","count":10},{"name":"St. Andrews University ScotGEM Medical Students","count":1},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2022)","count":1},{"name":"Fife Health & Social Care Partnership","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/974346?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"974346"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/974346/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"974346"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/974346/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"974346"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/974346/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"974346"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/f704h_120?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"F704H_120","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/culture?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"culture"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ear%20infection?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"ear infection"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/empathy?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"empathy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grommet?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"grommet"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hearing%20loss?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"hearing loss"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/quick%20service?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"quick service"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/respect?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"respect"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/understanding?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"understanding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/perforated%20ear%20drum?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"perforated ear drum"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/explanations?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"explanations"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/listened%20to?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"listened to"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/974667?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"974667"}]},{"id":974421,"author":"Emmgh49","authorRoleId":8,"authorRole":"a staff member posting for a patient/service user","title":"I have such admiration for the staff on the trauma ward","body":"Last Tuesday I slipped and fell on a wet floor in a coffee shop in my local town, I didn’t realise how serious the fall was and at first I didn’t want the ambulance to be called as I didn’t feel as if it was necessary. Then I realised after I tried to get myself up, that the only way I was going to be able to leave the coffee shop, was with help from the paramedics. The ambulance arrived within 10-15 minutes and I was brought over to the emergency department in Craigavon, I was given some morphine which was great as it eased some of the pain. The emergency department was so busy and the noise of all the patients was just awful I felt so sick and uncomfortable. I was placed on a really flat bed, it was more like a stretcher I found it hard to move my head to the side, I was left lying like this for a while and found it hard to breathe I almost choked. I have such admiration for the staff on the trauma ward, there all great at their job and I don’t think they are praised enough. The food on the ward hasn’t been great, the only thing that has been okay, has been the vegetable soup and mashed potatoes. In terms of nutrition, you wouldn’t get very much from the food they offer. The ward has some good facilities but I think there could be a big improvement in the equipment that's provided. I found it very difficult trying to exercise whilst I was lying on the bed and couldn’t get up, I didn’t feel as if these exercises were helping and I was just very uncomfortable. I think if the hospital had some sort of equipment that made it easier, like something to help glide your leg along whilst holding onto something, this would benefit the patients who are in the same exposition as me.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-09-12T13:25:06.6866667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-09-13T09:28:31.557","readBy":[{"name":"Southern Health and Social Care Trust","count":7}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/974421?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"974421"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/974421/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"974421"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/974421/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"974421"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/974421/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"974421"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_32024-trauma-ward?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"ZT003_32024-trauma-ward","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/equipment?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"equipment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/facilities?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"facilities"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/food?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"food"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain%20management?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"pain management"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/uncomfortable?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"uncomfortable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ward%20staff?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"ward staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/some%20exercises?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"some exercises"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/noisy%20emergency%20department?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"noisy emergency department"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/974874?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"974874"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/978164?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"978164"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/978194?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"978194"}]},{"id":974425,"author":"Emmgh49","authorRoleId":8,"authorRole":"a staff member posting for a patient/service user","title":"All of my needs are being met with the help of the staff","body":"I came in through the emergency department, it wasn’t too busy and because my injury was serious I got seen very quickly.
