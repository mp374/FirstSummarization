[{"id":995518,"author":"Shakera","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Missed miscarriage","body":"At 7/8 weeks of my pregnancy my GP sent me to City Hospital in Birmingham to get a drip because she found a lot of ketones in my blood and said I was dehydrated which could cause miscarriage. Went to City Hospital and they checked my urine again and said only a tiny amount of ketones is showing which is normal so went home thinking it’s nothing. They were gonna give me anti sickness but I was too unwell to wait to for hours so went home.  \r\nTried to speak to a doctor before leaving to find out the name of the anti sickness so I could get it from my GP, but two staff members spoke to me so rudely and I said I needed to wait or go back to A&E if I’m not feeling well. One of them tried to help but she wasn’t from that area so couldn’t do much.  \r\nI went for my first midwife appointment at 13 week. They took blood from me to check for sickle cell and thalassaemia in baby etc. Told my midwife I had brown stains in my underwear, midwife assured me it was nothing as long as it’s not blood. Went home thinking everything is fine. Next day I had my first dating scan in Sandwell Hospital and I remember seeing spotting in my underwear looked slightly red, didn’t think anything of it.  \r\nAt my scan found out my baby had no heartbeat and I had a miscarriage, My baby died at 8 weeks 5 days. Was referred to City Hospital, where I received advice on what could be done next. Sent me home with medicine management tablets to start at midnight but was bleeding a lot at home and advised not to take them later on and let nature take its course. Had cramps all night which came and went. Gave delivery to baby next day and was able to see baby clearly in sanitary pad.  \r\nAround night time I had the worst pain, which didn’t go away. It was worse than the pain I had before. Went to Sandwell A&E. Receptionist could see I was in a lot of pain and couldn’t care less. Nurses took me in but spoke to me like what I was going through was nothing. Acted like I’m a burden to them and told me and my partner we should’ve gone to City Hospital. Saw me in a lot of pain and gave pain relief which didn’t help. Nurses kicked me out of the room back into the waiting area saying they needed the bed space and I need to sit down but I told them I was struggling to sit down.  \r\nLeft the hospital and went City Hospital instead, because of being treated badly. I was seen in 10/15 minutes at City Hospital and received pain relief via cannula. Pain went after few hours and I went to sleep for a bit. Doctor came and asked what happened, then said I could go home and said I could buy buscopan over the counter for pain if it comes back.  \r\nThe care was slightly better at City Hospital but still not great. I wish we actually had nurses and doctors who actually cared, but I guess they’ve become desensitised as they’re always dealing with people. This was our first pregnancy and I feel so traumatised from the experience. I pray people don’t have to go through such treatment and have better care given especially when they’re pregnant!","criticality":"moderately

weeks. I was originally at a point of complete darkness, a victim to my own behavioural and thinking patterns. Mehnaz did an absolutely formidable job pushing me, challenging me, and empathising with me and my trauma to discover why my patterns are the way they are. We then worked towards identifying the triggers and how to make sure I don't allow myself to overthink, and ultimately increase my self-worth. I wouldn't change a thing about my time with her and the method of which we approached things. She managed to see the whole person that I am, and successfully broke down my defensive barriers to let her help me.

Didn't want to see her, just relied on the paramedics examining her at the time it happened, and didn't invite her in for further examination. On the phone he suggested blood tests, though he didn't have a clue how to book children's urgent blood tests and asked me to contact stepping hill, who they kept insisting urgent blood tests had to be referred by the doctor. Back and forth for over a week with stepping hill and the doctor, who was none the wiser in how to book them. I was basically his secretary for the week making enquiries by calling numerous departments at stepping hill on how to book these blood tests, I'd pass the numbers, references etc to the Dr who couldn't be bothered to give the numbers a call. A week later I managed to get a blood test for my daughter, through no help from the doctor, purely for a woman at stepping hill feeling sorry for me doing this amount toing and froing and I got a cancellation. Bearing in mind he still hadn't seen my daughter and all the while I was concerned of her blacking out on me again, though he did make a comment that she's at school now so she can't be that bad.\n\nCan't fault the receptionists here, every one of them was so helpful and understanding even though I was pestering them daily to get the Dr to call me, they always remained professional and sympathetic towards my frustrations.

In October 2019 I noticed that there was something growing under my ribs because I could feel it. It turned out that the cancer had spread to the liver and it was as big as an orange. \n\nWhat do all these doctors study for so many years I do not know, nobody ever though of a recurrence in a patient with a previuos history.\n\n The day I went to have my diagnose explained the doctor though it was the right time to fill the 'end of Life care' form. I suppose they saw me as already dead or just about. It was ghastly.\n\n Then there was Covid and it was as it was. \n\n In April 2021 I went to see a surgeon privately, he advised me to get a cancer transfer of care to another NHS hospital that would have offered better care than what I was getting. It turned out that for this surgery a \"cancer transfer of care is an extremely complicated thing\" and they took months and months. One of the reasons I was given is that the hospital I wanted to be transferred 'was not on the drop down menu'.... \n\nIn March 2022 I changed surgery, so that I could hopefully find someone that could do the 'cancer transfer of care for me' and you know what? they managed without problem. I m now being treated to the nearest hospital I wanted and the new GP is a lovely lady who know how to interact with people and the administrative staff just work better.\n\n I wish I had changed surgery a very long time ago. \n\nEverything is on my files and can be checked, I am still a stage 4 breast cancer patient with a poor prognoses but at least I am feeling better looked after.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-05-29T19:06:33","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2022-11-10T10:14:13","readBy":[{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2022)","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/995564?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"995564"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/995564/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"995564"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/995564/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"995564"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/995564/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"995564"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/e87034?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"E87034","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/believed?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"believed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/better?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"better"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breast?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"breast"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breast%20cancer?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"breast cancer"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cancer?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"cancer"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diagnose?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"diagnose"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fatigue?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"fatigue"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/liver?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"liver"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/looked%20after?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"looked after"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20believed?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"not believed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ribs?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"ribs"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cancer%20surgery?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"cancer surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"covid"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%2019?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"covid 19"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20looked%20after?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"not looked after"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/worn%20out?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"worn out"}]},{"id":995559,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Loved my experience ","body":"Would love to thank the team of midwife’s I had during my experience here two weeks ago.

She has Alzheimer’s is 95 and very frail. I stayed with her to reassure her, be a comfort to her and explain what was happening. The staff were very good and caring. After blood tests and an X-ray she was deemed fit to be discharged and I was told she would be taken back to the care home by ambulance. This seemed very necessary as she had even struggled to sit up to be dressed, was unable to walk and I didn’t think it safe for me to take her in my car, especially as it was dark and raining and  I am unfamiliar with the area. \nI left just after 5pm after she had been transferred to a wheelchair. She had only had one biscuit to eat since her breakfast but I knew that the care home staff would look after her.\nImagine my distress the following day when I visited her to find that she had arrived back at the care home at 2.30 in the morning.

I had travelled 55 miles to the hospital and so rather than make me return I had a 20 minute wait and was seen by the specialist who said that they would need to do a small operation and cut it away.  \r\nAgain, the staff took into consideration my travel needs and they spoke with David in the dermatology and minor operations unit, he agreed that if I didn’t mind waiting he would fit me in during what should have been his lunch break.  \r\nI was asked to wait, given a cup of coffee and then I had the procedure done.

I was referred to Gynaecology and my first appointment was at the Vale of Leven Hospital. A doctor there decided to do a hysteroscopy and fit a marina coil. The doctor was unable to proceed as they were unable to get through the cervix.  \r\nI was then sent for a hysteroscopy and for a marina coil as a day patient to have it done under general anaesthetic. This time I attended as a day patient to the RAH hospital in Paisley. When I came around from the surgery, I was very lucky to meet Dr Naheed, who was my surgeon. She took time to carefully explain that the operation had been unsuccessful, as they had been unable to get through my cervix. She was very calm and knowledgeable and put me at ease, taking time to ensure that I understood what had happened and why, and what my next steps were.  \r\nDr Naheed arranged an MRI SCAN and telephoned me to go through the results in detail and to discuss my options, again making sure I understood all the options going forward. I was then booked in for a full hysterectomy under the care of Dr Gupta, but with Dr Naheed as well.  \r\nI went into the ward the week before to meet with Dr Naheed and sign the consent papers. Again, she gave me her time and made sure all my questions and concerns were answered.  \r\nAfter the operation I saw Dr Naheed and she spent some time explaining the procedure and what had happened - she also showed me some photos which I found really reassuring. My specimens have been sent to histopathology and Dr Naheed will write to me with the results when they are known.  \r\nDR Naheed is an exceptional doctor. She has many skills, but I wanted to especially mention her absolute skill, empathy and the rapport she builds with her patients. It's something you cannot learn, you have it or you don't, and she has it in abundance.  \r\nI felt completely supported throughout the process and as a result was able to make informed decisions around next steps. I was so very lucky to meet with and be supported by Dr Naheed.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-11-08T10:48:38.93","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-11-10T11:37:08.677","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":7}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/994694?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"994694"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/994694/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"994694"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/994694/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"994694"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/994694/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"994694"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/c206h_502?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"C206H_502","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/c418h_502?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"C418H_502","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anaesthetic?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Anaesthetic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bleeding?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"bleeding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cervix?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"cervix"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/coil?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"coil"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctor?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"doctor"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/empathy?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"empathy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gynaecology?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"gynaecology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hrt?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"hrt"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hysterectomy?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"hysterectomy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hysteroscopy?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"hysteroscopy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/knowledgeable?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"knowledgeable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mri?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"MRI"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mri%20scan?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"MRI scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/operation?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"operation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/removal%20of%20ovaries?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Removal of ovaries"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scan?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tubes?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"tubes"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/womb?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"womb"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/calm?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"calm"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"supported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20ease?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"at ease"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/997390?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"997390"}]},{"id":995622,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Excellent medical care","body":"Met advanced practitioner Dan.

Due to there being no beds available at Resus, I was instructed by a paramedic to attend the waiting room but was urged by same that I wouldn't be there long, as they had carried out a handover with nursing staff and that I would be triaged almost immediately.  \r\nThe waiting area was very busy, however the paramedics explanation did not become reality as despite having whole body pain, temperature of 39.4, and severe pain and redness in arm with tracking lines coming from same, I waited in the waiting room for just under two hours. My family had to alert staff five times that I was deteriorating in the waiting area and needed urgent help. Despite this, other patients who arrived after me were being seen before me and these patients were able to walk, talk, joking with family and eating snacks whilst I was on the verge of unconsciousness.A family member, who is a nurse, was with me the whole time had called the ambulance on the basis that I would be seen quicker once at A&E, despite them not wanting to make that call due to 999 being for emergencies where they are near to or are life threatening. This was reiterated by the attending paramedics who stated we had done the right thing and also to A&E receptionists by family. During the wait as my condition declined, my family member was told by a nurse that just because I was in via ambulance this does not give me the right for priority to be seen. I find this absolutely ridiculous that despite it being a query for sepsis, I had to wait two hours to be seen, over patients who were in a more fit state with less severe concerns.However, after the two-hour wait I was seen by the consultant on duty for A&E. After taking one look at me on initial triage,the consultant realized how serious it was and ushered me to Majors, where I was provided a bay and a bed to relax, where the consultant also explained the situation and course of action. I was then treated by a staff nurse, who I cannot commend enough for their care, attention and professionalism whilst supporting my family and treating me through a very traumatic experience for everyone involved.The consultant also checked up on me regularly and assured me I would be admitted and in good hands. I would like to reiterate that the consultant was remarkable in their professionalism and how they were able to take the time and care for me on a busy night.Prior to heading to my new ward, I was also met by the clinical fellow for Ward 33.They explained my course of treatment and stated that I would be put up to the ward for a course of antibiotics for at least 24 hours.I was appalled that despite being rushed in by ambulance on a priority call, I was left waiting in a busy, riotous waiting room for two hours whilst drifting in and out of consciousness and being overlooked by receptionists and the triaging nurses. Despite this, once I had made it through the door and into majors, the care was excellent. I am only thankful that I caught the cellulitis at its early stages, as time is precious for this sort of infection, and to look back and have lost two hours in A&E at crucial times is a scary thought, I hope no one has to go through this, as if it had not been detected until later and I had to endure that wait, who knows how bad the blood poisoning could have spread. Through, in my opinion, the fault of an A&E allocation/handover system. I strongly believe that patient condition should overwrite the first in, first seen mentality.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-11-08T11:31:09.1133333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-11-10T12:15:34.673","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Fife","count":16},{"name":"Fife Health & Social Care Partnership","count":2},{"name":"Office of Murdo Fraser, MSP for Mid Scotland & Fife","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/994713?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"994713"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/994713/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"994713"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/994713/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"994713"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/994713/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"994713"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/f704h_110?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"F704H_110","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/f704h_180?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"F704H_180","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxious?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"anxious"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scared?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"scared"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/traumatic?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"traumatic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/worried?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"worried"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/a&e?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"a&e"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/antibiotics?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"antibiotics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cellulitis?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"cellulitis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/consultant?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"consultant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sepsis?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"sepsis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/severe%20pain?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"severe pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/temperature?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"temperature"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/triage?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"triage"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/triage%20nurses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"triage nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting%20time?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"waiting time"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/receptionist%20attitude?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"receptionist attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care%20in%20waiting%20room?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"care in waiting room"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/995639?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"995639"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/995736?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"995736"}]},{"id":993467,"author":"Sue eliza","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"My problem","body":"I was meant to have an appointment to see a doctor about a problem I have.

During this she was sent to have her leg checked due to swelling and a potential blood clot. \nFor this we had to see a triage nurse so waited 2hrs in A&E, then she was sent to ACU for a scan. \nHere they took her blood, where she was told it had then gotten too late for a scan but she had to wait for her blood results. \nWe waited from 18.30 - 21.30 where she still had been seen by a doctor regarding further appointments, at this point we were told she had to come back the following Monday for a scan, but without an appointment. Then on the journey she received a call to say she should have been given blood thinners before leaving. \n\nWe returned Monday, waited during this time nurses wanted to go over the same checks as Friday, as if they hadn’t even checked her file. When she went for a scan she was then told she should have had an appointment and by chance they had fit her in, otherwise it would have been 17.00 for a slot bearing in mind we arrived for 9am to avoid the waits experienced on Friday. \n\nAfter this she was told there was no clot but was rudely told she had to wait 4 hours to see a doctor at which point we left. \n\nOverall communication was poor, the organisation of the ward was terrible, there was not privacy when doctors spoke to other patients as they were sat so closely in the same room, with no curtain and the fact the doctor had wanted to prescribe blood thinners before knowing if there was a clot is quite concerning. Not to mention treatment of other patient's on the ward that I witnessed. \nI appreciate the NHS is underfunded, with few staff that are overworked and underpaid but the lack of even what I class as general customer service skills is really sad, frustrating and worrying. \nFortunately this isn’t my local hospital and I wouldn’t advise anyone to come here unless absolutely necessary.

My daughter was very poorly and was triaged very quickly. Very quickly after triage she was given pain relief. After seeing a specialist consultant she was given a multitude of drips and was constantly checked upon. In fact many of the patients in the waiting area were given drips with treatment. I have never seen this before. We needed to wait 12 hours for a bed to become available which is unfortunate but cannot be helped. The important thing is that treatment started in the waiting area and she was constantly checked on and made comfortable. The nurses and doctors looked exhausted, most were there the whole 12 hours, but continued to give everybody care rushing around constantly and with smiles on their faces. \nThe 2,separate nurses in charge on the front nurses station we’re wonderful. I went to the front for regular updates and not once was I made to feel a nuisance. I received gentle reassurance and an apology for the wait. These people have nothing to apologise for. They are working above and beyond. \nIt took 3 attempts to withdraw blood from my daughter as she was so dehydrated. She is very squeamish and has fainted while giving blood in the past. But the nurses who attended to her were so incredible at distracting her and even making her laugh that she was fine. \nThere were two separate female patients who obviously were having a mental health crisis and were quite aggressive. They were treated with kindness, patience and respect. The second lady was particularly aggressive, was shouting profanities and became horribly racist. She was dealt with calmly but firmly with extreme professionalism. \nI honestly witnessed so much kindness and sincerity not only to us but other patients that I was quite moved. \nPlease pass on my enormous thanks to all staff working at a&e on Saturday. They are all doing an incredible job and are beautiful humans. \nIt does not go unnoticed and is so appreciated. \nAs I said on a public forum, they deserve salaries ten times what they are being paid! Fingers crossed this new government will recognise this. \n\n","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-11-10T00:37:43","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2022-11-10T12:51:08","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/995653?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"995653"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/995653/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"995653"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/995653/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"995653"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/995653/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"995653"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rwh01?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"RWH01","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/crisis?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"crisis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nuisance?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"nuisance"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"blood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dehydrated?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"dehydrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/exhausted?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"exhausted"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helped?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"helped"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/important?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"important"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/in%20pain?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"in pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/looked%20after?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"looked after"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain%20relief?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"pain relief"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/relief?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"relief"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sincerity?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"sincerity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/triage?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"triage"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appreciation?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"appreciation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health%20crisis?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"mental health crisis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fine?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"fine"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/comfortable?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"comfortable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20looked%20after?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"not looked after"}]},{"id":995650,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Absolutely wonderful ","body":"I suffered a serious panic attack this morning, which went on for several hours and became very scary. \n\nTwo paramedics called after a short time and were incredible.

Please can I get an appointment to see a doctor at the practice . \n\nkind regards \n\nChris Miller ","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-11-10T09:58:05","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-11-10T12:59:41","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/995659?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"995659"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/995659/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"995659"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/995659/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"995659"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/995659/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"995659"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/h81007?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"H81007","score":null},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1031298?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1031298"}]},{"id":994773,"author":"izarsk34","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"A very good experience","body":"Ultrasound needed for suspected fluid build up after my mastectomy a week ago. Ulrika, the nurse present, was so lovely and encouraging, even letting me use her own arm to lean on, as raising mine into the air and holding it there was proving very uncomfortable, putting any discomfort of her own to the side to help me! All staff involved in the procedure were AMAZING !!
