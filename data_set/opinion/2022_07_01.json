It has gotten to the point where I'm afraid to call because I am worried they will be nasty, condescending, or rude. I have even cried after coming off the phone with them before. Occasionally you can make it through booking an appointment without being left feeling like you were just told off/talked down to, but I wouldn't describe those experiences as 'pleasant'.\nOnce I was asked brusquely why I was making an appointment so soon after being seen, and asked \"is it *actually* important\". When I explained I had been told to follow up by the doctor, there was a long sigh as if I was a major inconvenience, and then: 'Fine! What's your date of birth?!'\nAfter getting fed-up of 5min. pointless phone calls, I asked if there was any way to see a doctor in person. I was told to explain why, and then: \"No you can't make an appointment for that, just speak to my colleague\", and was promptly transferred to someone (no idea who) to explain my issue. I didn't know a receptionist could say no to making an appointment when I had a clear medical reason. Maybe if they had explained what the problem with my request was, or was more patient in the way they spoke, I wouldn't have felt so put-out.\nI can't put my finger on what the exact issue is, just that as a medical receptionist I imagine you should not make sick/vulnerable/potentially anxious people feel belittled or ashamed to call their healthcare provider. But both I and my flatmate, who is also registered here, feel this way whenever we speak to the reception team. You are also made to feel like you've inconvenienced them/asked them the biggest favour, when simply booking an appointment.\nI understand that the NHS is under stress, and it must be a demanding job, but as it is a customer service role I think basic people skills should be a given.\nThe doctors, when you can see them, are great and professional. The main nurse is lovely. I just wish the front-of-house team didn't make me dread dealing with my GP.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-06-30T14:48:11","progress":"Unread

After my sister had a miscarriage the year before I knew that North Lanarkshire midwives would not see patients before 8 weeks gestation as most miscarriages happen before this time. I therefore decided to book a private scan. The scan was done in early June, the pregnancy sac could be seen however there was no fetal pole or yolk sac, I was past the 7 weeks mark and I was certain of my dates. I was advised to contact the Early Pregnancy Unit for advice.  \r\nI contacted the EPU at Wishaw 2 days later, I made 63 calls, they either rang out or the line was engaged. There was no facility to leave a voicemail. I contacted Coatbridge Health Centre and spoke with a midwife who was really good and advised that as I had no pain or bleeding I wouldn't be seen at the EPU.  \r\nThe next day I had slight bleeding and tried again to contact the EPU, I made 50 calls and still couldn't get through. I started work in the afternoon so my sister offered to call for me, she made 36 calls and also could not get through.  \r\nThe next day the pain increased and I started to bleed more heavily. I contacted the Coatbridge midwives as I still couldn't get through to the EPU. I spoke to a Midwife who offered to contact them for me, they called me back and an appointment was arranged for the following afternoon. Unfortunately that night I miscarried.  \r\nThe next day I still couldn't get through to the EPU so decided to call Coatbridge midwives. I spoke to a midwife and advised of what had happened and asked if I was still required to have a full bladder for the scan. They advised I should still attend with a full bladder. There was no compassion regarding my miscarriage and I felt dismissed as if what happened was not their concern.  \r\nI attended my appointment and after a very uncomfortable transvaginal scan it was revealed I had miscarried however there appeared to still be some tissue still to pass. They took some blood to check my HCG levels and they advised they would contact me the same day with the results. My results revealed that my HCG levels were still high and I was advised to return within 48 hours to have them repeated.  \r\nThe EPU only runs from Mon-Fri 7am-4pm therefore I would need to attend triage to have the blood work done. The other option was to take another pregnancy test within a fortnight to check my HCG levels. I found this option dismissive and after what had happened I really didn't want to take another pregnancy test.  \r\nI attended triage 48 hours later, whilst taking my bloods I was asked what it was for. It was an extremely upsetting to explain why I was there. I asked if the results would be passed to me that day and I was advised that was the EPU responsibility and they would contact me the following day.  \r\nThe next day I was contacted by the EPU. They asked if triage had already passed my results and I informed them that I hadn't and was advised it was the responsibility of the EPU. I was then told that triage can pass the results however choose not to. My results indicated that my miscarriage was complete and my HCG levels were now at 10 and if I did another pregnancy test the results should come back negative.  \r\nI asked about after care and basically what happens now. I was given information regarding when my cycle should return to normal and my case was closed at their end. Again I asked what happens now. I found the experience traumatic, upsetting and physically painful and I thought as common practice I would be passed onto services that would help me deal with my loss. The member of staff from the EPU seemed flustered and put me on hold as they went to find a website address for me. After several minutes I was given the address of a website and advised that my care is now closed at their end.  \r\nThere is obviously a gap in care when dealing with miscarriages and I felt no one took responsibility for my care after my pregnancy loss. I feel in limbo with this expectation that I should just return to normal, as if it shouldn't matter. This pregnancy mattered to me and feel extremely let down by the care I have received. I know there has been a pandemic however I feel this has been used as a crutch to justify bad service.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-06-19T20:26:06.03","progress":"Change

Procedure was booked in after calling Antrim booking office was told the date was booked for end of June 22. When I asked the exact procedure and if any other steps are required was told not their department they are bookings only and that I need to contact the secretary of the consulting doctor.  \r\nFollowed their instructions attempted to call the secretary after a very long wait on hold put through to secretary line only to hear a voicemail stating unfortunately secretary for my doctor in ENT is off until the following week. Called ENT again to speak to a different secretary but they advised that only the doctor's secretary could discuss my procedure details upon this I asked if the doctor could call me to discuss this further I was told unfortunately my specific doctor does not work on Fridays and I would need to call back at a later date.  \r\nDuring this I notified my management of the procedure as I was unsure of the amount if time I would require and coming up to June/July getting time off is not an easy thing to do and trying to survive on sick pay would be a challenge. I had to swap shifts and get only one day off approved to cover me for a few days off as I still didn't know the ins and outs of the procedure or recovery time.  \r\nI called back on the day when the secretary was due back in, it was after 2pm and was told unfortunately that the secretary had finished for the day but they would leave a message for them and asked if they could call me on the following Monday. 3 day before my surgery date as I needed information on what was happening. I also advised them I would he working this day but to leave me a voicemail and I would get back to them asap. No call happened, I chased this up the next day and once again the secretary was not in but one of the other secretaries in the ENT was able to give me general info based on the letter I was provided, they said based on the letter I would be on local anaesthetic and recovery could span from 2-14 days and that full recovery would be approximately a month based on this info my management were able to help and book paid time off and very short notice.  \r\nToday the day of my surgery at mid ulster hospital day surgery I have been informed that due to my health conditions that local anaesthetic is not a safe option and that no surgery can be done until a preassessment has been conducted and that the preassessment as well as the surgery will need to be conducted at a different hospital (antrim).  \r\nThe staff at mid ulster have been extremely kind and helpful and apologised that no date for a surgery should be given without a preassessment being completed first and that unfortunately no surgery would be happening today, and that they would be investigating this matter as it is not the first time it has happened. After 2 years I have been advised I will be notified in the future of another possible date.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-06-30T09:12:08.2933333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-07-01T13:05:40.147","readBy":[{"name":"Northern Health and Social Care Trust","count":3}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/952255?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"952255"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/952255/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"952255"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/952255/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"952255"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/952255/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"952255"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt002_24026_100?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"ZT002_24026_100","score":3},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/booking?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Booking"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/day%20surgery?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"day surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disregarded?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"disregarded"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disrespected?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"disrespected"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/distressed?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"distressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctors%20letter?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"doctors letter"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ent?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"ENT"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/felt%20ignored?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"felt ignored"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helpful?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"helpful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/information?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"information"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kind?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"kind"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/time%20wasted?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"time wasted"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/secretaries?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"secretaries"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/953747?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"953747"}]},{"id":952288,"author":"skyec44","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"I would like to thank all concerned","body":"I cannot fault any part of my treatment.

I struggle sometimes being in new situations and can get very scared and angry if I don’t know what’s happening or if I have to undergo a new treatment I have never had before.  \r\nI recently had a bowel impaction sorted at hospital and I was really nervous. I refused the treatments because I was so scared by what the doctors were saying & I couldn’t understand.  \r\nMy dad was there to help me and Sarah from the Archie Foundation at the Royal Aberdeen Children's hospital really helped me through it. Not only did she distract me with lots of fun activities, she helped me & my dad when I was angry/upset and didn’t want to go to surgery. We played lots of games all week and had the best time. It helped relax me and I felt safe with my dad and Sarah looking after me. Sarah and the team made me so welcome and we were all instant friends, we made friends with other patients too.  \r\nI don’t think the children's hospital would run anywhere near as well without Sarah and the play team. It helps us all stay calm and makes hospital visits less terrifying. We had such fun during a really stressful period that I’d love to go back and visit. It’s difficult to express how much Sarah and the Archie Foundation at Aberdeen helped us.  \r\nDad got to rest for a bit when Sarah was teaching me fun new things in the play area, which he needed as it was hard being in hospital for a week worrying about me. I don’t think we could ever thank Sarah, the play team or the Archie Foundation enough, we wouldn’t have got through it without you all.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-06-30T12:11:57.6933333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-07-01T13:50:57.073","readBy":[{"name":"Office of Alexander Burnett, MSP for Aberdeenshire West","count":1},{"name":"NHS Grampian","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/952343?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"952343"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/952343/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"952343"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/952343/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"952343"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/952343/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"952343"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/n121h-play?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"n121h-play","score":4},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/activities?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"activities"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bowel?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"bowel"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/caring?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"caring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dyslexia?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"dyslexia"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lovely%20staff?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"lovely staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scared%20at%20first?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"scared at first"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/less%20worried?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"less worried"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/less%20nervous?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"less nervous"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/953186?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"953186"}]},{"id":952344,"author":"RobinG","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"I couldn't ask for better care","body":"I had an appointment in urology on Monday morning.

However the staff there were so helpful & friendly and put me at ease right away. The consultant Mr Cox was really great. It was quite difficult for him due to a constriction that has been causing problems. I really appreciated his persistence and care. He gave some very wise advice (against) on possibly going private and I really appreciated his wisdom and caution on that route. I really felt for him as it was a bit of a struggle but I am thankful for his skill. After wards he took the time to explain everything and what they plan next. He has put me on the urgent list- and down to accept a cancellation and I believe he is doing all within his means to get the problems sorted. So I want to say a BIG thank you to all the team there.

During my induction I had great staff and have only positives to say about the experience.  \r\nI later moved down to the labour ward where I met the midwife and a student midwife who would be there for the birth. The midwife couldn't have been less interested in anything I had to say and this process continued throughout my entire labour. They administered hormone treatment without my consent even though I was already at 8cm and progressing well on my own without it. I started over contracting and had severe pain in my back and I vocalised this several times but they refused to check me even though my labour had been moving quickly.  \r\nI felt the urge to push and they still didn't check me. Other members of staff, the student midwife, the person who gave me my epidural stated that they felt I should be checked but they insisted I wasn't to be checked for another 2 hours.  \r\nAfter an hour the baby's heart rare plummeted and they came to check me, only to run back out seconds later when a doctor rushed in and told me we needed to get baby out quickly. After going to my 8 week check my doctor told me this was because baby got stuck the wrong way round in the birth canal which obviously couldn't have been avoided but was a traumatic situation for me and the baby. All the emergency staff running in probably could have been less if they had just listened to me when I said what was going on. Or I could have been offered a c section and wouldn't have all the trauma of feeling the doctor turn my baby vaginally  \r\nFurthermore I hemorrhaged and was told that I didn't lose that much blood. However a doctor came down 3 days later to recovery to tell me that I was at transfusion level and they couldn't tell me what it was at the day of birth when my heart rate was through the roof. I got an apology.  \r\nI then asked to be discharged as the care I was receiving in recovery was also very very poor from very rude staff. I was then readmitted because my baby was jaundiced and suffered weight loss due to breast feeding and my supply not coming in due to having pre-eclampsia. Nobody advised me of this.

I had tried and failed to breastfeed my 2 year old daughter in 2020 so this was very emotional for me.  \r\nI contacted the Fife Infant feeding team during the later half of my pregnancy and asked if I could have a chat through my anxieties about attempting to breastfeed.  \r\nDuring my 36th week of pregnancy, Kelly from the team visited me at home. She spent well over 2 hours talking to me about my anxiety and giving me lots of motivation too. I contacted Kelly 1 day after My son was born and she visited us many many times at home during the first month of his life. I know for a fact we would have given up breastfeeding again at a very early stage had it not been from the excellent care and support Kelly provided me with. She was always at the end of a text or phone call and always offered to visit us at home for hands on help. She was professional but also friendly and I felt so comfortable being able to dicuss anything with her. She and the whole team do a fantastic job and are invaluable to anyone who is breastfeeding.
