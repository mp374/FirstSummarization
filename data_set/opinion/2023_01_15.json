Felt like if i was not there reminding them they will leave it for morning shift to pick up the pieces . Its 5.36 am right now and just given the fluids through IV. First treatment since arriving at 10.30 pm.\n\nI appreciate that its Saturday and a busy shift for staff but someone visibly in distress because of sickness/vomiting non stop should be given some empathy.

I have been booked in with the wrong doctor, been spoken to by one particular receptionist in such a rude, sarcastic and dismissive way that I almost cried (I am not a crier, but when you are at a low ebb and feeling dreadful, some things can be the final straw), and not once have my prescriptions been completely right.  As far as my treatment itself goes, I feel like I am going around in circles. I don't feel listened to at all. You are rushed out of the room, talked over, one GP completely denied that I had told them something that I have brought up with them several times. I even thought of booking a private GP appointment just to see if someone else would at least really listen to what I am saying, but unfortunately, I cannot afford to. I have dealt with this surgery for many years, not for myself but for my children at various stages, and they absolutely were not like this ten or even five years ago. The service, from reception, dispensary and most of all the GPs themselves has taken such a nose dive over the last 4 or 5 years. Certainly pre-covid. As I said before, I don't feel I have been listened to and feel very unsupported by what used to be an excellent GP Practice. It's all tick boxes and forms, there is just no care at all.

The lady who looked after me on the ward after who had a cup of tea ready and waiting for me when I came round, you are the best. Just what I needed. Thank you everyone you were amazing I hope you understand what a fantastic job you are doing and how much the kindness you show means to people.
