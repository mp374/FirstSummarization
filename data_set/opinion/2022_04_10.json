In summary I can see why no patient can be given 100% I feel under the circumstances the staff give 200% so from the bottom of my heart well done to the staff and the NHS of the hospital ","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-04-09T08:37:28","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2022-04-10T09:09:31","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/930405?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"930405"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/930405/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"930405"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/930405/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"930405"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/930405/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"930405"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rvv09?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"RVV09","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/arms?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"arms"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/chest?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"chest"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/chest%20pain?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"chest pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/heart?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"heart"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/in%20pain?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"in pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/looked%20after?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"looked after"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/neck?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"neck"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"amazing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doing%20well?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"doing well"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"put off"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/worse%20than%20before?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"worse than before"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20looked%20after?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"not looked after"}]},{"id":930404,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Excellent medical care and kind, compassionate…","body":"I was admitted to the Acute Medical Ward at the Northern General following an A&E admission on 4/2/2022.

But this nurse objected to it and was very blunt and dismissive about it. I had to solve my predicament on my own by returning to reception and ask them to print off the forms again for me which they happily did and I believe they were surprised at the nurse’s attitude.

I can’t describe how you all were with me other than you saved my life… you gave me purpose to live.

Theatre staff were pleasant and reassuring, despite working through their breaks to get as many ops done as possible. Unfortunately two ladies on our bank of beds were rescheduled which was devastating for them but difficult choices seem to be the way things are running in the NHS. \n\nBack on the ward I was greeted with a lovely hot chocolate and my special request egg sandwich… Ward staff were working hard tending to all the individual needs, getting us all mobile. Their attention to detail goes a long way to making the patient experience a far less traumatic one. Big thanks to all the team who treated me… I feel a million dollars today!

I was able to have my first choice of treatment (MVA) just a few days later.  \r\nThroughout my phone calls, scans and surgery, every member of staff was so compassionate and caring. They took the time to explain everything to me and sat with me while I cried. They listened to my story, even though it wasn’t medically relevant.  \r\nThe midwife present during my surgery held my hand and kept me talking throughout the procedure and the doctor and student doctors told me exactly what was happening and helped me through it all. As horrible as the situation was, the surgery was actually a very positive experience and has given me closure on the pregnancy and helped me move forward.  \r\nMy only complaint, which is not the fault of the staff, is that the EPAS is only open Monday-Friday. I learned about my missed miscarriage on a Saturday morning and I had a very fraught and anxious 48 hours without knowing my options before I could speak to anyone on the phone.  \r\nThanks again, especially to midwife Michelle and doctor Laura. You made the hardest point in my life that little bit easier.","criticality":"minimally critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-04-07T21:20:21.4466667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-04-11T08:18:12.513","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lanarkshire","count":4}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/929924?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"929924"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/929924/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"929924"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/929924/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"929924"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/929924/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"929924"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l308h_501?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"L308H_501","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/above%20and%20beyond?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"above and beyond"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/local%20anaesthetic?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"local anaesthetic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/miscarriage?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"miscarriage"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/opening%20hours?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"opening hours"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pregnancy?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"pregnancy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ultrasound?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"ultrasound"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20for?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassionate?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"compassionate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wonderful%20staff?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"wonderful staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/listened%20to?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mva?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"mva"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/932188?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"932188"}]},{"id":930592,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Made me feel at ease","body":"Had follow up appointment a 3b tear from childbirth.

I have consistently been trying to ring at 8:15 for an appointment however the phone line is always busy and cuts off. I have tried for 3 days now with no luck. I tried again around 1pm (outside the busy phone times as stated by the practice) but still the phone line is busy. It is not an issue with my phone as when I ring prior to 8:15 my call goes through with the automated message saying phone lines open at 8:15.\n\nThere is an option for either an online consultation or to book an appointment online on the website but this never seems to be working and instead the practice prefers for everyone to ring at one time and take up all the phone lines. Wouldn't a practice try to have less people ringing and make use of the online service? It is ridiculous. 111 online refers me back to ringing a GP but how can I do that when I can't even get through in the first place.\n\nMajor improvements need to be made for the patient service as it seems like no one is bothered. Just scroll through the most recent reviews and you will see just how difficult it is trying to get a hold of anyone at this practice. Totally agree with all the 1 star reviews everyone has been posting. The generic answers are just copied and pasted back as a response to each review but no changes have been made to anything. It is clear that patients and their wellbeing are not at the forefront of this practice.\n\nAfter numerous attempts to get in touch with the GP practice I finally managed to speak to a receptionist yesterday (29 Mar 22) at midday after being on hold for approx an hour. After explaining my symptoms I was told there were no more appoints available and to try again tomorrow. I was made aware e-consulatation is available every morning 8-8:15 and phone lines open at 8:15 so I can try either option. I was also told to keep ringing back because its normal for the phone lines to say they're busy and cut off.\n\nThroughout the day my symptoms worsened so I rang 111 at approx 1pm  and they referred me back to my GP for a telephone consultation. This appointment appeared on my Airmid app so I was satisfied I would be contacted. Surprisingly I was not contacted and the appointment disappeared from my app. This is shocking behaviour. Especially if highly vulnerable kr elderly people required your services and were referred by 111.\n\n30 Mar 22 I took the receptionists advice and tried e-consulatation at 8am. I got through all the questions only to be told I would need to speak to someone. So at 8:15  I began calling the GP. I rang 200 times and didn't get through once.  I don't have that much free time to sit around and try making an appointment. It's hard to fit in with a working day.

I was given medication for suspected heart attack in the Ambulance. The Ambulance service was excellent and a thorough report was written up containing my medical information to handover. This included information of my previous airway surgery in September 2021, during which I had had a cardiac arrest and received CPR.  \r\nI was tested for COVID and bloods were taken and an ECG and then I was wheeled in a chair and left in the corridor opposite the main entrance doors. Despite several requests for pain relief I was not given anything until 4+hrs after admission. I had suffered a functional nonepeleptic attack which resulted in me falling of the chair onto the ground. This was most likely triggered by pain and sitting in a cold doorway for over 4hrs. I couldn’t get up off the floor myself as I have no control over My limbs when this happens. One of the Nurses was very rude and insisted that if I was able to get myself off the chair then I could get myself back on it again. A hoist was sent for but it took 3 to 4 attempts to get me into it as it seemed the staff hadn't been trained in its use. I was then put back onto the chair and ignored. I was still in pain and this was worse since they’d rolled me in and out of the hoist.I asked a cleaner to ask one of the nurses for pain relief. A nurse came out and took my blood pressure and went and got me Paracetamol. The staff member that had been rude earlier then came out and I asked how much longer I’d have to wait to be seen. The reply was that at the start of their shift there had been an 8 hour backlog, so I could work the rest out for myself. I had been waiting over 4hrs and by these calculations it would be at least another 4 hrs before I would be seen. It was already the early hours of the morning, I was tired, in pain, cold, and didn’t feel safe, especially because of the way I was treated earlier. I said well then I am going home.. to which they replied that this was my choice. They then pulled my bag from behind the chair, that the ambulance crew had said to pack. My husband arrived later and stood at the door of the treatment room but then had to go in as nobody came out. He told them he was here to take me home. They said that given the seriousness of your my condition, they would strongly advise waiting to be seen by a Doctor. My husband replied that I'd be better off at home and we will speak to the GP in the morning.  \r\nThe next morning my daughter rang to find out the results of my blood tests and was told as I hadn't stayed to be seen, we couldn't get the results, and that they will be sent on to the GP.  \r\nMy daughter rang the GP and they said they hospital should have given the results to me. I was able to get a review appointment with My ENT consultant the next day ,who was able to see the results and confirm that they had been alright. The most likely cause of the severe chest pain was from subluxation of my ribs and bruising from the CPR. I have hypermobile joints and they hadn’t broken but had moved.  \r\nI know A&E departments are under pressure but there was no excuse in My opinion for the total lack of care I received. Everyone deserves to be treated with respect and dignity..things need to change.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-03-25T15:10:29.6966667","progress":"Made

I went directly to Minehead Minor injuries unit for treatment and my joint was x-rayed and successfully put back into place.  \r\nAfterwards, a nurse ‘splinted’ the joint by wrapping it in Elastoplast. Unfortunately I am - as it turns out - very allergic to Elastoplast. I removed the Elastoplast the next day when I noticed a reaction developing but I now have a very severe skin issue which will probably take a number of weeks to resolve.  \r\nWhen I got to Cornwall on the next leg of my holiday, I phoned 111 and was directed to St Austell minor injuries where I was offered a choice of two types of splinted glove, or have the joint in plaster. The health professional who dealt with me there said that using Elastoplast for a dislocation was a very old fashioned way to deal with that type of injury.  \r\nI’m wondering why I wasn’t offered a splinted gloved at Minehead? It would’ve been so much better.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-04-08T09:41:30.0066667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-04-11T09:24:29.997","readBy":[{"name":"Somerset NHS Foundation Trust","count":5},{"name":"Cornwall Partnership NHS Foundation Trust","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/930092?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"930092"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/930092/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"930092"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/930092/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"930092"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/930092/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"930092"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rh5f5-miu?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"rh5f5-miu","score":3},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rj801?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"RJ801","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/allergy?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"allergy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dislocation?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"dislocation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/splint?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"splint"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thumb?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"thumb"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/elastoplast?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"elastoplast"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/splinted%20glove?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"splinted glove"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/934137?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"934137"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/934157?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"934157"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/934211?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"934211"}]},{"id":930079,"author":"BillyC","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"A truly great service","body":"I took unwell driving into Glasgow with my family.

It was literally an awful experience.  \r\nI was told on numerous occasions I should be in a single room but was put on a ward and I was promised everyone was properly tested for Covid before going on the ward (they came in the next day to test people they a had forgotten to test), the ward was also mixed with men and women which I thought was inappropriate as well.  \r\nI was told my curtain could be kept closed to protect me but there was still the problem of a shared bathroom but no other options were offered to me.  \r\nPrior to discharge my nurse had told me a taxi would be arranged to take me home as it was outwith my area but the discharge team were not told about this. When they called the ward they were told to show me to the bus stop.  \r\nNow with no immune system I should not be on a bus, I am recovering from Covid & had another infection which led me to being in the hospital to advise showing me to a bus stop I thought was really inappropriate.
