On arrival there was a small queue at the entrance but upon seeing us a very kind security guard beckoned us inside out of the cold where we could wait until we were assessed by a member of staff. \nThe triage process was very quick and the duty Registrar soon outlined a plan of care and we were informed of what that plan of care was. \nWe were transferred to HDU and whilst here each and every member of staff (clinical and non-clinical) treated him with kindness, with respect and with care. The also kept us regularly updated. \nAlthough we did have a wait for the scan, the staff nurse who was overseeing our care, although very busy herself with other patients, took the time to visit our room frequently to check on my father-in-law. His vital signs were recorded regularly. \nUnfortunately, he did require stitches to his head wound and the duty A&E Doctor in attendance that day was both professional and caring.\nWe spent approx. 8 hrs at Northwick Park Hospital (between the A&E department and the discharge lounge) but we were so grateful for all the care and attention we received on that day. Upon discharge we were given the correct documentation as well as a patient information leaflet on head injury.\n","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-01-18T12:17:40","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-01-20T09:11:39","readBy":[{"name":"London North West University Healthcare NHS Trust","count":2},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2022)","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/910314?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"910314"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/910314/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"910314"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/910314/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"910314"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/910314/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"910314"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/r1k01?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"R1K01","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care%20plan?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"care plan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/head?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"head"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/head%20injury?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"head injury"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/informed?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/injury?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"injury"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scan?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/signs?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"signs"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stitches?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"stitches"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/triage?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"triage"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wound?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"wound"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/911094?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"911094"}]},{"id":910313,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Quick to arrange an appointment","body":"Appointment within two days.\nPositive and explanatory consultation with some plans for progress.\nPrescription provided and tests booked.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-01-19T18:58:25","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-01-20T09:12:12","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/910313?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"910313"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/910313/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"910313"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/910313/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"910313"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/910313/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"910313"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/p87649?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"P87649","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/positive?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"positive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tests?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"tests"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/917607?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"917607"}]},{"id":910312,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Pleasing experience","body":"Visited the audiology department and was treated with respect and empathy.

All the staff were always very cheerful and helpful, they always had time for even the most demanding of patients. Although Ward 10 is very old now, and visitors are not allowed due to lack of ventilation , I found the week passed pretty quickly. I started off in a very new single en suite room in a newish, wing of the hospital. This was great to begin with and although I really didn't want to transfer to ward 10, within half a day, I was was feeling very relaxed, probably down to all the staff and amiable patients that were present. I think this had a very positive effect on my mental health as being stuck on your own is not for everyone. On the negative side, I would say the food wasn't to my liking, the TV needs a remote, as there was only one channel as far as could work out, and to enter and exit the shower there was a relatively steep (for patients with mobility problems) slope.","criticality":"minimally critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-01-18T22:04:12.82","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-01-20T10:32:46.387","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Fife","count":12},{"name":"Scottish Recovery Network","count":1},{"name":"Fife Health & Social Care Partnership","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/909863?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"909863"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/909863/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"909863"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/909863/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"909863"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/909863/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"909863"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/f704h_110?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"F704H_110","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/f704h_180?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"F704H_180","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/all%20staff?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"all staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helpful?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"helpful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/positive?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"positive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/quick?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"quick"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/shower?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"shower"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/the%20food?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"the food"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tv?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"TV"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ventilation?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"ventilation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/visitors?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"visitors"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cheerfulness?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"cheerfulness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/relaxed?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"relaxed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/shower%20room?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"shower room"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/910656?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"910656"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/912358?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"912358"}]},{"id":909866,"author":"Missy moody","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Journey to detox","body":"After a year in ‘training’ with CGL … attending weekly meetings, attending courses and reading lots of quit lit ..

This is rare in children and needs very careful management.  \r\nI popped to the pharmacy department at NDDH while my son was attending outpatients, purely on the off chance they might be able to help and advise. Leah, who was working that day, was fantastic, going above and beyond to listen to my concerns and understanding that this is a difficult condition to manage, and that it is crucial to have the correct medication available at all times (separate bottles to be kept at home and school for example). She advised me they could dispense the correct medications from NDDH and was more than happy to help organise this, immediately relieving us of weeks of stress.  \r\nThe pharmacy department often get overlooked when the pats on the back are going out to the NHS workforce. The pharmacy staff at NDDH are also working above and beyond in these challenging times and yet were happy to take the time to understand the problems we were facing and able to help us without question.  \r\nWe can now collect what we need from NDDH every 4 weeks and know that we no longer have to worry about having to order repeat prescriptions and explaining why our son needs this medication issues twice each month.  \r\nMany thanks NDDH pharmacy!","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-01-19T07:19:39.77","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-01-20T10:39:21.64","readBy":[{"name":"Royal Devon University Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust","count":6},{"name":"Royal Devon University Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust (2)","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/909945?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"909945"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/909945/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"909945"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/909945/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"909945"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/909945/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"909945"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rbz12-pharmacy?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"RBZ12-pharmacy","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/above%20and%20beyond?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"above and beyond"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diagnosis?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"diagnosis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helped?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"helped"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/less%20stressed?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"less stressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/listening?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"listening"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pharmacy?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Pharmacy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/steroids?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"steroids"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/understanding?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"understanding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fantastic?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"fantastic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/relieved?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"relieved"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/took%20time?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"took time"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/adrenal%20insufficiency?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"adrenal insufficiency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/many%20thanks?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"many thanks"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/relieved%20now?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"relieved now"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/942009?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"942009"}]},{"id":909947,"author":"Robroy75","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"They could not do enough to reassure me","body":"I felt very apprehensive and tense on arrival for an endoscopy procedure even though I had one eleven years ago.

When I left two days later and came home I was dealing with a sort of PTSD from the labour. My community midwife read my notes and said that from reading the notes written by the midwives in the hospital, it sounded like they had attacked me. They didn't ask for my consent to perform checks, to stitch my lower area straight after birth with no anaesthetic, to push down extremely hard with no warning on my stomach to expel blood clots. Medication was not given to me when I should of had it, eg, I had blood clots immediately after birth from haemorrhaging and the midwife informed me that they didn't have time to give me my clexine injections that day, it would be the next day with the next shift of nurses. I wasn't given my omeprazole when I was 2 days on the induction ward, which resulted in my spending my short labour with chest pain from the excess acid and then vomiting all over myself in the bed. I was asked to leave my room the day after giving birth (the previous evening before my baby was feeding correctly) as they needed my bed. They asked me to pack up midway through trying to feed my premature baby and wanted to move me to their staff room. I couldn't use this room, as they had another lady in there with her baby. I was sent home with clexine injection and was not shown how to use them, which resulted in me having a panic attack, due to the fear of using a needle and not treating the blood clots. Hours after I got home from the hospital, I phoned to ask how I administer the injections, only to be told if I couldn't do it, no one would do it for me and I had to just suck it up and get some Dutch courage. The next day, my midwife came and listened to my concerns about the Injections and my sons feeding, resulting in his losing weight. He was sucking on his tongue and not the bottle teat, as he was premature and didn't have his sucking reflex ready for going home. The midwife was very concerned about my mental health and encouraged me to write a complaint. I explained I wanted it to be over and I didn't want to write the complaint. They explained that I could read my notes when I was ready so I could start to process my labour, as that morning I had a breakdown with flashbacks from my labour. Needless to say I never read the notes. My son is now 12 weeks old and the best baby you could imagine. I had always wanted a big family as I came from one myself, but after the treatment I received and the PTSD I have surrounding the labour, I will never have another baby again.","criticality":"strongly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-01-08T19:38:27.94","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-01-20T11:43:40.543","readBy":[{"name":"South Eastern

I said that it was my very back tooth on my right side at the top. The gum was bulging partly over the tooth that was sore.  \r\nOn the next day I was contacted by the dentist (I cannot remember their name unfortunately) from the Royal Alexandra Hospital. They phoned to give me an appointment time where we briefly discussed the issue with the very back tooth.  \r\nI arrived at the hospital, and the dentist looked at the back of my mouth. At this point, I mentioned again how it was the very back tooth and the bulging gum that was giving me bother. I was given two options: root canal treatment or tooth extraction. It was explained that they could only do the part 1 of the root canal treatment and I would need to register myself at a dentist and get part 2 done there. At this point I didn’t think I was registered at a dentist.  \r\nI was skeptical about the root canal as I’ve previously had bother with this tooth/gum area about 3 or 4 years ago which required a course of antibiotics. That coupled with the fact I didn’t think I was registered at a dentist, and I was worried I would not be able to get registered in time to do the part 2, I opted for extraction. The dentist said they would give me an X-ray just to double check everything but when informed that someone else would need to perform the X-ray, they said that it was no longer required and didn't matter. The procedure went fine, and it wasn’t until my mouth was no longer numb that I realised the wrong tooth had been extracted.  \r\nThe following day I spent the day in absolute agony and panicking about my missing tooth before my partner insisted we phone NHS 24 again to explain.  \r\nOn the subsequent day the hospital phoned to inform me that I was in fact still registered at Bearsden Dental Care, despite not visiting since 2015. I phoned Bearsden dental care and I was given an emergency check up the same day. The dentist could confirm that there is an issue with my wisdom tooth growing in, (the very back tooth that I was describing) and it has caused an infection as well as irritating the gum. I was given two options again, a course of antibiotics to try save the wisdom tooth or wisdom tooth removal. Ideally, I just wanted the wisdom tooth out but considering I now have a huge gap next to it, I didn’t want to jump into removing any more teeth. I’m currently completing the course of antibiotics but it is likely the tooth will need removed regardless.  \r\nLooking back, I should have noticed the red flags with the dentist considering the X-ray issue but at the time I thought they knew best. I’m extremely disappointed and confused that the issue with my wisdom tooth & the infection wasn’t picked up on but I’m extremely glad I followed my instinct quickly as matters could have ended up a lot worse than what they are. Not only do I still have the original issue, but I will now need to look into repairing the issue this dentist has created.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-01-18T19:31:57.7","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-01-20T13:52:18.56","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":6},{"name":"St. Andrews University ScotGEM Medical Students","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/909829?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"909829"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/909829/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"909829"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/909829/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"909829"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/909829/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"909829"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/c418h_140?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"C418H_140","score":1},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confused?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"confused"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disappointed?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/worried?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"worried"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/antibiotics?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"antibiotics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dental%20treatment?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"dental treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gum?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"GUM"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/infection?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"infection"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/removal%20of%20wisdom%20tooth?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Removal of wisdom tooth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tooth?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"tooth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tooth%20extraction?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Tooth extraction"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tooth%20pain?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"tooth pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unsure?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"unsure"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/x-ray?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"X-ray"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/910413?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"910413"}]},{"id":910391,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Fantastic treatment","body":"My surgery this month could not have been better.

I have nothing but praise for the consultant and his team who carried out the procedure, I was very anxious having only just started to recover from an emergency appendectomy ( ruptured appendix which was carried out by Pinderfields ). The team at Calderdale ensured I was relaxed throughout the procedure and explained everything as it was happening which I found very reassuring. They also appeared to have a very good team spirit and the two main men were quite the double act. My thanks go to them, their excellent team and the  nursing staff on the small side ward where I stayed for a period of four/five days. I would also like to mention the senior cardiac nurse who rang me at home recently to check on my progress and answer any questions I might have . I found him to be very polite, extremely knowledgeable and personable.

CQC eventually did inspect this nursing home and downgraded it from Outstanding to Requires Improvement . A safeguarding investigation conducted by Leeds City Council found many areas of concern. The final outcomes meeting was attended by many representatives in health services and social care but , although invited, no representatives of Pennington Court arrived and no apologies were received  .We followed the Westward Care complaints procedure and allowed ample time to investigate our concerns. Throughout the process self imposed deadlines were not met, records were incomplete and it took some considerable time to extract a full set of documents. The details are very sensitive so I don’t feel it is appropriate to share them in full on this platform but for every concern about her care eg very poor quality and often incorrect care notes -Her eyesight was given as very poor in one place and very good in others. She had both glaucoma and macular degeneration . Our concern about this, the least contentious problem, was met with an excuse of ‘ eyesight is used for different purposes’\nDespite having an LPA for Health and Well Being ,and visiting every day, we  were not kept informed of changes to medication, or indeed any care issues. I believe there have now been a number of staff changes and these may have been followed by improvements to the care provided. However, unless poor practices are recognised and accepted by management teams then the necessary improvements will not be made. \n","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-01-19T21:45:23","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2022-01-20T14:05:51","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/910403?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"910403"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/910403/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"910403"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/910403/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"910403"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/910403/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"910403"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/1-119664834?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1-119664834","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/concern?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"concern"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/death?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"death"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/eyesight?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"eyesight"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/glaucoma?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"glaucoma"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/informed?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/macular?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"macular"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/macular%20degeneration?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"macular degeneration"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20good?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"not good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/safeguarding?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"safeguarding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/social%20services?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Social Services"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"covid"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%2019?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"covid 19"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20home?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"at home"}]},{"id":910019,"author":"User777","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"MRI Results- NHS Lanarkshire","body":"I was referred for an MRI scan by a neurologist at Hairmyres, NHS Lanarkshire due to suspected MS.

I wonder if they would do the same to someone with a physical injury. This is discriminatory. \nThe surgery staff especially doctors need training on communication skills and empathy. Stop putting awful tasks on receptionists and take accountability for your decisions. \nI really hope one day someone with compassion and good leadership skills runs this surgery.

There was no communication from the ward at all. I rang to speak to someone about my Dad's health and care I was told to ring the following day at 10:30 to speak to a doctor. When I rang there was no one available. I was told I couldn't visit. I could speak to my Dad on his mobile but his speech wasn't very good as the days went on.  \r\nAfter ringing him at the end of November he seemed upset and I couldn't make out what he was trying to tell me. I decided to visit my Dad because no one was answering the ward phone. On arriving at the ward there I was told I couldn't go in as there was an emergency in one of the bays. I said my Dad was in that bay. I was asked the bed number but I didn't know.  \r\nThey went off to find out the bed number and I was advised to go into the quiet room. It was a cupboard with folded beds - it was awful. I asked what the problem was but kept being told that they couldn't say. Without anyone saying anything I was more or less being told that my Dad had passed away  \r\nI was so upset. A doctor came in and said my Dad had passed quietly then just went and left me alone until my husband came. My husband asked someone to get the doctor back to answer questions, but they couldn't give us the answers because they weren't my Dad's doctor.  \r\nThey took us to see my Dad and he was so cold he couldn't have just passed away.  \r\nI still don't know why my Dad died. If they thought he was so poorly they could have rang me so I could have been with him. They gave me someone else's clothes. It felt like they just wanted me out of the ward. They then went to give me my Dads soiled underwear. It was awful from start to finish.  \r\nThey did an autopsy on my Dad but I still don't have the outcome of that.  \r\nI found the way they treated my Dad and myself to be unacceptable.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-01-19T11:20:11.9233333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-01-20T14:49:34.627","readBy":[{"name":"Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/909981?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"909981"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/909981/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"909981"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/909981/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"909981"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/909981/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"909981"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rx1cc_340?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"RX1CC_340","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/isolated?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"isolated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/passed%20away?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"passed away"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/poor%20treatment?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Poor treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unacceptable?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"unacceptable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/visiting?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"visiting"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/explanations?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"explanations"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/no%20answers?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"no answers"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/913709?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"913709"}]},{"id":910004,"author":"jojomcc","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"A terrible experience!","body":"Attended my GP with suspected kidney stone/infection, gastroenteritis/vomiting/fever/dehydration. I was sent to IRU (Initial Receiving Unit). I was there for all of 10 minutes then in a chair to another waiting area SATA (Specialist Assessment and Treatment Area) . As a frequent hospital visitor this was the first time hearing about or being in SATA. It was very busy with patients coming and going. One member of staff, sometimes no member of staff. ECG, Covid test and bloods done. No issue with heart so little confused.  \r\nInitial consultation with Dr (3 hours in). Will organise xray and collate with blood results and come up with plan. Chest xray done, confused again because no issue with chest or heart. 2 more hours (5 in total) another consultation in the waiting area with doctor. No treatment done at this point.  \r\nMy bloods show infection and I need CT scan to rule out obstructing stone. Asked at this point if I could have a painkiller as in lot of pain. Told by nurse at 5:30pm (5.5hrs in) that a porter is on their way to take me for CT. Nurse took me to CT at 8:30pm (3hrs later, 8.5hrs in) to get scan. Back to SATA.  \r\nAt this point I had to lie on trolley with pain. Requested another painkiller. Not written up for it so the doctor had to authorise. 3rd consultation with a different Dr at 10:00 pm (10hrs in). They will be admitting me, but just have to wait on bed availability. Saline drip attached around 10:30pm prior to going to ward. Was subsequently unattached at ward as canula not working properly and never attached again.  \r\nA terrible experience! I watched patients cry because they were in pain and asking for updates, told someone would get back to them and never did. I saw patients get angry because felt that they had been abandoned in the room and no-one was updating them. I saw a patient sat it her own urine for hours because no-one would help her, and I watched patients leave because they could not wait any longer to be seen. I did not have that luxury as I needed antibiotics and pain medication.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-01-19T12:46:37.1933333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-01-20T15:09:01.243","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":10}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/910004?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"910004"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/910004/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"910004"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/910004/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"910004"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/910004/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"910004"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sj9-south-glasgow-hospital-aru?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"SJ9-south-glasgow-hospital-aru","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sj9-south-glasgow-hospital-sata?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"SJ9-south-glasgow-hospital-sata","score":1},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/angry?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"angry"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/chest?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"chest"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ct%20scan?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"CT scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/drip?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"drip"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ecg?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"ECG"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/exhausted?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"exhausted"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fever?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"fever"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gastroenteritis?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"gastroenteritis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/in%20pain?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"in pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/infection?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"infection"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kidney?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"kidney"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/long%20wait?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"long wait"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/more%20staff?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"more staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurse?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"nurse"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sore?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Sore"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vomiting?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"vomiting"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/xray?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Xray"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid-19%20test?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"covid-19 test"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20kept%20informed?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"not kept informed"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/910439?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"910439"}]},{"id":910424,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Absolutely amazing ","body":"Just wanna say how my experience giving birth here was the best.. i got induced and the care i got from the midwifes and paediatric doctors was outstanding!

I've had problems with my hips for years. It's a combination of genetic hip dysplasia and osteoarthritis from a very active life.  \r\nAfter a number of investigative procedures it was clear I'd worn through the cartilage and the joint was bone on bone. I was advised to have an implant put in and rather than get total hip (due to my age at the time) a BHR (Birmingham hip) was my best option. I had the surgery in Jan 2016. I awoke with a 15 inch incision (it's usually 5\" - 7\", so twice the size) and told it was a difficult surgery due to the muscle mass in my backside.  \r\nWhat became apparent was that following my surgery, my pain levels did not improve. Not only that, I lost functionality, I lost movement. I now need to use my hand to lift my left leg into a car and out again - not something I had to do before and not something your average person in their 40's needs to do. Over the years there were a couple of plans to explore why I may still be in pain (via a series of cortisone injections), however these were quickly scrapped and no reasoning given. In my opinion, my surgeon is deficient in communication skills and, dare I say, compassion, let alone any bedside manner. Initially I had appointments yearly, where I would voice that my implant clunked and shifted, that my pain levels were worse than pre-op and that most days walking more than a couple of hundred metres was impossible due to cramping. I would get told (with a smile) that the xray showed the implant was in place and that the surgery was a success. Following this surgery I have not slept normally, I cannot walk more than 100m on a bad day and I take an array of medication daily that includes strong opioids, anti-emetics, migraine meds, among others. The cocktail of drugs I take is constantly evolving. After 4 years of this, I managed to get an appointment with the chronic pain team who, after seeing me, agreed that there was an ongoing issue with the joint, that my problem was not either psycho-somatic nor neurological.  \r\nOn the back of this, I was able to get a second opinion. At Glasgow Royal Infirmary they ordered a bone scan and an aspiration of the joint to assess the stresses and possible infection in the joint. Neither investigation came up with answers. There was no infection and no unexpected results from the stress test. I was told there could be a number of reasons for my pain/issues but that many cannot be tested for without direct investigation. I was also told that given my wider history, a revision to a total hip replacement is the best option. It has been over a year since this decision was made.  \r\nTo add to my pain issues, I exhibit all of the symptoms of metallosis. Metallosis occurs in up to 5% of metal on metal implants, such as the Birmingham Hip implant I received. The problem is the implant is made of a cobalt and chromium alloy and through both leaching and wear, these metals get into your bloodstream and poison you. I have \"morning sickness\" (nausea upon waking up everyday -and have had this for about 18mo now), headaches, blurred vision, tinnitus, anxiety, arrhythmia, memory issues. I have highlighted this to both my new surgeon and my GP and highlighted I have not been tested for cobalt or chromium levels in over 2.5 yrs (despite the manufacturers recommendation of 6 monthly testing) as well as the NHS's own policy of maximum yearly testing). I suspect they don't want me to be a metallosis statistic if I'm having a hip revision anyway. So I've had definitive surgery dates set and cancelled on two occasions. One date in Sept and then another in Dec. In the meantime, the metallosis symptoms have worsened, where I am now basically bed ridden (blurred vision, nausea, tinnitus, arrhythmia, tinnitus, and elevated pain) I can no longer work or function. My surgery date has not been reset and no advice available on when it might take place. Nor will anyone undertake a simple blood test to assess the metal ion levels in my blood. I have found my treatment both shockingly bad at times, negligent at best and wholly unacceptable. I've lost over 6 yrs of my life to pain owing to the original surgery and at present there is no end in site for me. Nor do the NHS seem to be taking my care seriously or even following their own protocol on blood ion testing. I just want this nightmare to be over.  \r\n","criticality":"strongly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-01-06T16:39:44.5333333","progress":"Story has a

relative","title":"Lovely efficient staff","body":"My Mum was admitted to RD&E in the morning for tests and unfortunately due to not knowing if she had Covid (she tested negative) she was sent to Torridge Ward (Infectious ward) until the evening. Thankfully she was in a room on her own during this time.  \r\nWe were met by a lovely Nurse (Lyn) who kindly went to the trouble of wearing a mask where my mum could see her mouth as she is deaf and once a room was found we were offered drinks and biscuits. After being told she would have an x-ray around 7:00 pm, at 8:30pm (still no x-ray) she was transferred to Okement Ward.  \r\nBy this time my Mum was very tired and anxious, hoping to go home but still waiting for x-ray. As soon as we arrived on Okement ward it had a sense of calmness and everywhere looked spotlessly clean and organised. Immediately a sweet nurse came and took Mum's blood pressure and scanned her wristband, shortly after she came with drinks and biscuits and Navi came and chatted to us. She immediately showed empathy that Mum was tired and anxious and went to contact x-ray to find out what was happening. Luckily she did this because they didn't have mum booked to be collected so a few minutes after this call a nice porter came and collected Mum and within a very short time she was back on the ward again (x-ray department was empty so she went straight in).  \r\nNavi came back and explained everything and told us she had relayed to other staff that we were waiting to see if Mum could go home (we don't live locally) so would appreciate knowing the results as soon as could be expected which is exactly what happened.  \r\nNavi gave us reassurance and showed kindness and compassion (as did Lyn on Torridge). If we had to have left Mum on Okement ward overnight in the care of Navi I can honestly say I would have been less anxious and concerned knowing she were in the care of such a lovely, efficient member of staff. Really makes a huge difference.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-01-19T16:07:56.54","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2022-01-20T15:48:33.777","readBy":[{"name":"Royal Devon University Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust (2)","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/910098?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"910098"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/910098/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"910098"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/910098/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"910098"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/910098/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"910098"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rh801_301?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"RH801_301","score":5},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rh801_430?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"RH801_430","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20pressure?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"blood pressure"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cleanliness?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"cleanliness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/efficient?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"efficient"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/empathy?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"empathy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/interested?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Interested"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kindness?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"kindness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/knowledgeable?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"knowledgeable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lovely%20staff?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"lovely staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/organised?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"organised"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/porter?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"porter"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/respectful?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"respectful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tests?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"tests"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thoughtfulness?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"thoughtfulness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/x-ray?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"X-ray"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/calm?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"calm"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassion?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"compassion"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/well%20explained?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"well explained"}]},{"id":910444,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Great experience yesterday","body":"I attended yesterday for my 4th covid injection it was an absolutely brilliant experience it was the best painless injection of them all given by healthcare assistant.

I lost the use of my entire body, arms, legs, speech, and on admittance to hospital, my family were told if I had not been rushed into hospital, I would have been dead within two weeks. I fought my way back from that and remained abstinent for 6 years. I lost my Dad in 2017, and this did, and still is, crippling me. Unfortunately, I turned to the drink, again, and I would probably be dead had it not been for my Counsellor at Inclusion Visions, Lakeside. All the staff have been amazing but my Counsellor has seemingly gone above and beyond. He has been a rock and it is nice to deal with someone who knows and understands what you are going through. My Counsellor is very professional but, at the same time, you feel so comfortable discussing difficult issues, that you feel as though you are talking to a friend. Suffering from severe anxiety and panic attacks, this has made all the difference to me, and aided in my ongoing recovery.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-01-19T17:30:29.5166667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-01-20T16:08:43.923","readBy":[{"name":"Midlands Partnership NHS Foundation Trust","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/910112?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"910112"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/910112/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"910112"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/910112/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"910112"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/910112/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"910112"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rrex4-inclusion-visions?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"rrex4-inclusion-visions","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grief?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"grief"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/above%20and%20beyond?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"above and beyond"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/alcohol?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"alcohol"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/alcohol%20dependency?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"alcohol dependency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing%20staff?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"amazing staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/counsellor?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"counsellor"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/knowledge?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"knowledge"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professional?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"professional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/understanding?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"understanding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/made%20a%20difference?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"made a difference"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/panic%20attacks?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"panic attacks"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/comfortable?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"comfortable"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/933046?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"933046"}]},{"id":910102,"author":"Marwe44","authorRoleId":3,"authorRole":"a parent/guardian","title":"Not allowed to deal with my child's appointment","body":"Got a call from oral hygiene about my child, asking to speak to them.

After 4 long difficult months of severe pain between medication, we attended his appointment and he was changed to a new drug. During the appointment they explained the side effects. They highlighted to us how any sever skin reactions needed reported and that it carried a high chance of skin cancer.  \r\nJust 6 weeks into taking the drug he had started to develop small patches of itchy skin. Then he developed a large growth suddenly on his neck. After Christmas 2019 a referral from the GP was made and he was seen in February and had it removed by a private clinic as an NHS referral . After Christmas my husband began to develop an infernal itch in his skin. This began on his arms and legs then quickly spread to every inch of his body, so badly he began to tear lumps out of his skin. He was told to ask the GP but was already on the maximum dose the GP could prescribe without a consultant letter.  \r\nWe had called the rheumatology team but they were unable to see him face to face and an appointment was made for a review in March. This didn’t happen due to covid. Having to call an answer machine and wait for a call back 2/3/4 days later. As lockdown ensued and my husband's health became worse and worse and no matter the calls to the team no one gave any suggestions of what to do, despite my constant enquiries about the medication causing a reaction. We were told that the medication couldn’t cause him to be itchy or have bad skin down the phone yet reading the leaflet of the drug said differently.  \r\nHe eventually had a phone consult with the doctor in April 2020, where the consultant said to stop the medication. At the time we asked how will he manage the pain and he said ask your GP. When we asked the GP for medication he could only prescribe low grade pain killers as a consultant hadn’t given him a script for anything else. My husband was then seen at the end of August. I requested to go to the appointment as he can no longer manage long appointments without an advocate and support. I was told no due to Covid so I asked him to video call me when the dr arrived so that I could ensure that his point got across that he had been left without proper pain management and that he wanted to be referred to the pain team. The doctor said no he couldn’t call me at the time as he didn’t want to have a conversation like that.  \r\nThe doctor spoke with my husband that day about getting a new biological drug started. In August my husband was not in great shape mentally but was able to physically do work from home during the day. Since April his health has continued to go down hill and no one appears to care . He has lost 3 stone in Weight, has had to go on every supplement for blood work as he has become anaemic, with horrific low levels that are still not corrected 4 months later. He has now got muscle wastage on his arms and legs and deep depression because his pain is so unmanageable.  \r\nThe doctors do not seem to see that he needs immediate help as they keep pushing his appointments further and further back, although one has rung to ensure that he is coping until his appointment I was devastated when we realised they didn’t even take the time to prescribe him something in addition to help the pain management. The Rheum team provided a script for exactly the same tablets my husband was already taking. When my husband pointed this out they said they would sort it and handed him back the same script in an envelope to give to the GP. This was then recognised to be no different and didn’t have any additional tablets.  \r\nHe has now been waiting for an appointment with the rheumatologist nursing team since August 2020. Originally the date was October this became November then had been moved to January 2021. However after receiving a call it’s been now moved until the end of April 2021. I do not see this an an adequate timeframe for someone to wait to begin medication. We would happily have the conversation over zoom to speed the process up or speak to a doctor, or a different nurse or attend a weekend clinic, or attend any day anywhere in Northern Ireland if it would speed up the process.  \r\nMy husband now spends on average 16-18 hours each day in bed due to the pain he is in and he can’t move as the pain medication isn’t strong enough. I have to work full time and I have 2 young children and I have to now run around trying to contact doctors and nurses during allocated times ( as a teacher this is a challenge) and then I have to wait for them to call me me back as my husband isn’t able to do this. We have reached the point of total despair. He needs treatment now and needed to be put on treatment in August 2020 not 12 months after stopping the last medication. Overall I am feeling extremely let down by the NHS care.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-01-18T23:09:21.3066667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-01-20T16:38:42.183","readBy":[{"name":"Belfast Health and Social Care Trust","count":13}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/909868?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"909868"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/909868/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"909868"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/909868/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"909868"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/909868/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"909868"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt001_03021-rheumatology?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"zt001_03021-rheumatology","score":1},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt001_11021_410?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"ZT001_11021_410","score":1},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frustrated?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"frustrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ankylosing%20spondylitis?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"ankylosing spondylitis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/empathy?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"empathy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/follow%20up?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"follow up"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/forgotten?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"forgotten"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/overwhelmed?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"overwhelmed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain%20management?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"pain management"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/rheumatology?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"rheumatology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/severe%20pain?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"severe pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/skin?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"skin"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unheard?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"unheard"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/worthless?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"worthless"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/spoken%20over?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"spoken over"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lost?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"lost"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20long%20wait?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"very long wait"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/915267?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"915267"}]},{"id":910471,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Poor care","body":"I had my baby in the early hours of 09/01/22 and the care I received was diabolical. The midwives lacked the basic human skills of empathy and sympathy. They failed to provide me with the very basic care. \nI was quickly taken to the labour ward when the midwives realised that I wasn’t suitable for triage. The bed had no bedside rail to provide me with support during my time in labour. I told the midwife I had SPD but she still tried to widen my legs beyond my pain threshold. \nAfter my baby was born she didn’t tell me the sex of my baby. I was shivering like a leaf to which she responded to by saying that I was in shock. She didn’t offer to cover me up and I had to ask for a sheet. After I was sewed up I was handed my baby to finally have some skin to skin contact. This was nearly 30 minutes after delivery. I was then left to lie in my own blood for two hours where the midwife said she would be back soon. After the paracetamol kicked in I had a shower in a bath which had someone else’s hair inside it. I then asked the midwife if someone would be changing my sheets she said she didn’t have time. I offered to do it myself to which prompted her to reluctantly changed my sheets. \n\nI was then moved to a ward so my baby could be monitored for 12 hours. My observations were done 4 hours after being moved to the ward. This was only because I felt like I had a temperature. \n\nI work for the NHS and I have done so for 7 years. I have never failed to give my patients the very basic care. I have always given my patients the care and treatment I would want for myself and my loved ones. I mean, that is what they teach you. And there are some things that can’t be taught. I was so ashamed and disappointed that I was in the receiving end of such poor care. I am so grateful that my labour was short, I dread to imagine how it would have been if it was longer. \n\nIf I had to rate the care and treatment of this department, it would be a 1/10. That’s me being generous. Queens hospital you need to retrain your staff, give your staff regular supervision, look out for signs of burn out and take a leaf out of Royal London Hospital.
