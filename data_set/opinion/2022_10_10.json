After another nearly 2 hours, I saw a doctor who I thought was helpful, this then proved not, because, after being prescribed with pain medication to pick up the next day, they had given me no pain relief to take me out of the pain I was currently in. I was no further forward. I came back to the North Devon District Hospital (NDDH) the following morning to pick up this prescription, to be told they hadn't got one for me and to go to A&E to find out what was going to happen.  \r\nGot to A&E and was told I'd have to be re submitted and go through the whole process again so I was submitted, saw a triage nurse at who told me there was no record of me being there at all the previous evening.  \r\nI now currently feel very let down by the NHS and feel as though I've been passed from one person to the next and still in pain.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-10-01T11:15:02.8166667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-10-10T09:20:01.507","readBy":[{"name":"Devon Doctors","count":2},{"name":"Royal Devon University Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust","count":7},{"name":"Royal Devon University Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust (2)","count":1},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2022)","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/980515?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"980515"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/980515/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"980515"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/980515/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"980515"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/980515/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"980515"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/ntphk?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"NTPHK","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rh880_180?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"RH880_180","score":1},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxious?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"anxious"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sad?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"sad"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/a&e%20waiting?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"a&E waiting"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/abdominal%20pain?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"abdominal pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/depressed?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"depressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/documentation?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Documentation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20taken%20seriously?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"not taken seriously"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain%20relief?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"pain relief"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/time%20taken?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Time taken"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/triage?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"triage"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20angry?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"very angry"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/next%20step?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"next step"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/no%20further%20forward?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"no further forward"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/passed%20from%20pillar%20to%20post?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"passed from pillar to post"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nothing%20too%20much%20trouble?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"nothing too much trouble"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/982963?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"982963"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/985659?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"985659"}]},{"id":981683,"author":"normarc84","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"GP staff behavior","body":"After answering questions by 111 online related to my symptoms, I was advised to contact my GP.

She did not apologise or sympathise, and simply contradicted me saying 'they are answering calls'. I have the proof on my phone that the phone system was not working again. The surgery acknowledges this is a problem on this very website. Why lie to me? Besides which, 3 of them were just chatting away doing nothing at all when I walked in. She then haughtily told me not to speak to her like that- I was calm in tone, I had not raised my voice, I was not making comments about her, I was explaining that was going on and I had a right to be upset. She did not care. World Mental Health day today! I made a complaint last week which surprise surprise, no-one has responded to and am still waiting for confirmation of whether a prescription has been renewed two weeks later.

If they are unable to address the issues, whether that be GP staffing levels or some other problem, the least they need to do is explain this to us, the patients. \n\nWhere is the communications strategy? Simply be up front with patients about the problems you are facing and how waiting lists and appointment availability is being tackled. Put it on your website or something. \n\nIn the meantime, surely there’s a triage system?
