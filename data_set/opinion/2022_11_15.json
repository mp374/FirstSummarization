I received conformation that I met the criteria to have an assessment, however after emailing them they said I would likely get an assessment after I have turned 18. My mental health greatly declined while on the waiting list so I made a second referral to the anxiety and depression pathway when I was 16. After emailing them they said that although I met the criteria I would not be able to receive any help from them because I would be over 18 by the time I reach the top of the waiting list and therefore too old to receive help from camhs. When I was 17 I had to go to a+e because of my mental health. I waited 16 hours to see the camhs crisis team, where they told me to refer myself to talking therapies (a service where they had previously told me not to refer myself to) then they discharged me. I made a referral to talking therapies however they currently have a 6 month waiting list.\nIn the three and a bit years I have been on the camhs waiting lists the only contact I received was when I wanted to kill myself, with the advice being 'look somewhere else'.

This caused huge stress and anguish in our household and a complete breakdown in the functioning of our family, from jobs, school and personal relationships.  \r\nHaving been taking part in the Children and Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAMHS) therapy sessions, at the start of September we referred to the Community Intensive Therapy Team (CITT) team to provide support daily in our home for my wife an I to help our daughter eat (initially) and to navigate through the complex issues raised by this illness.  \r\nFrom that day onwards things took a huge step forward. We were given advice, reassurance and motivation to keep going. The team are all very skilled listeners and experienced in knowing the right way to put things for my daughter to comprehend. Their help was genuinely invaluable and I will never be able to thank them enough for helping us get our family back.  \r\nSpecial mention to Peter, Evan, Angela, James and Trisha who were the most frequent visitors and we became very fond of their company, as with all the team, they deserve huge recognition for helping to essentially save my daughter's life.

I've been seen by the staff for minor ailments, vaccinations, screenings, pre-pregnancy, and during my pregnancy etc. This is the first time I wrote a detailed review for a medical centre. Because I strongly believe slmc is a truly exceptional service that deserves recognition! \n\nHere are my reviews of my overall interaction with them:\nBooking and Appointment:\n- Online form – I like slmc's new medical form, it’s user-friendly and I can quickly explain my symptoms with all the prompts provided by the software. I can complete the form in <10mins, which is a significant time-saving compared to having to speak to someone over the phone!\n- Appointment slot – almost all of the time, I’m being given phone appointments within 3- 4 working days. However, they also offered an in-person appointment if they think you’ll be benefited from a physical examination. I do like that you can indicate your named Dr to see.\n- Phone/receptionist – occasionally, I’ve to phone slmc to confirm my prescription/letter request etc. The waiting time varies between 5-20mins, but they have the option of you to “save your queue number” and receive a callback. It’s a great initiative. This could be improved by the call back not being hung up after only 2-3 dial tones.\n\nInteraction with GP/Nurses/Other staff: \n\n- GPs & Nurses – I’ve seen various GPs & nurses in the last 4 years. The doctors have been supporting me before and during pregnancy. They made you feel heard, and cared for and include you in the decision-making for your treatment. They won’t hesitate to advocate for you if they think you are being ‘forgotten’ by the hospitals/other services that they referred you to. I also accompanied my husband to regular post-surgery appointments from May-June 21. I’m impressed by the care, dignity and compassion shown by the nurses in this GP. One of the nurses who’s not just excellent in her work, but truly cares for her patient’s condition and recovery. \n\n- Admin/Reception staff – this has been kept to a minimum since the introduction of the online form. There are some exceptional admin staff who’ll go above and beyond for you. However, an improvement can be made in their approach behind the glass wall (e.g. volume when discussing patient’s conditions).\n\nOverall, Despite NHS’s limited resources, I'm impressed by the team's efficiency and care! It’s not easy to balance both, but Star Lane GP has shown in the past 4 years they are worthy of 5* reviews.

When I registered here I needed to be referred to urology. The Dr did this but after 7 months I hadn't received a confirmation/appointment date so I thought I would check up on it. When I called the GP said that they had referred me, but the referral was \"bounced back\" the next day because they hadn't attached the letters. Instead of anyone (at all) telling me this so that I could re-send them the scanned letters, they just said nothing and I had to start the whole referral process again. Great. \n(2) When I had an ultrasound of my pelvis, the results were meant to be sent to my surgery so the GP could discuss them with me. After 2 weeks I hadn't heard so I entered an app request to hear about the results. The surgery bizarrely emailed me a photo of my scan result and the notes (with no subject or any text). Funnily enough, I'm not a physician. I actually had to google the words in the notes myself to figure out if anything had gotten worse since my last scan. No one called me to discuss them. I actually never bothered chasing it up because this kind of thing is constant, and you have to pick your battles.\nThe reception staff truly never answer the phones. Like everyone else says, if I have to call up, I can be on hold for an hour (true story) as caller number 3 the whole time, and even when you get through they are so clearly not fussed whether they help you or not. The really bad part: my partner was given a used (and cracked) urine sample cup with someone else's name labelled on it. Don't waste your time pal. Go somewhere else.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-11-14T16:56:57","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2022-11-15T10:30:54","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/997375?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"997375"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/997375/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"997375"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/997375/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"997375"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/997375/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"997375"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/f83635?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"F83635","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/heard?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"heard"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pelvis?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"pelvis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scan?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ultrasound?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"ultrasound"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/urology?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"urology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waste%20of%20time?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"waste of time"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/worse%20than%20before?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"worse than before"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20great?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"not great"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/like%20myself?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"like myself"}]},{"id":997372,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Kidderminster MIU","body":"Had to use this service twice this last year for minor complaints (muscle injury and insect stuck in ear) both times have been meet by friendly staff, conditions treated with good clinical care.

I have certainly witnessed the downhill spiral of service provided over the last 7 years. Appointments are hardly ever available with the doctors, one's care is not followed up and long holding times on the phone continue. Most of the time appointments are not available which is the key issue for this surgery is. The reception staff members are not in the least friendly and are antagonistic and unhelpful.  Many Burnham Health Patients who are friends in the local area all talk about Burnham Health Centre and the lack of patient care and not being able to get appointments.   I have read through some of the reviews online again today and certainly agree with most of the reviews and 1 star rating.  Other surgeries offer easy access on their online page such as patient suggestions and complaints, numbers of doctors and names etc.  There are also other Trusts that offer easy web page booking systems and cancellation with make it far easier than the Patient Access System which clearly doesn’t work at Burnham Health Centre. Today was another example, I called and held for nearly an hour just to be told by the receptionist to hurry up with my enquiry as the line is for emergencies calls only.  The receptionist advised me that all the calls are directed to reception and that the automated messages when calling through for options such as new appointments or cancellations all filtered through to reception anyway. With other words, reception is the emergency line.  I don’t know why the receptionist treated me like this today – is my call not important?  I am well aware that Burnham Health Centre does not take emergency calls and I was not aware that they have an emergency line.  I was not shocked at what the reception said to me today as there always seems to be some sort of divergence when making contact with the surgery as experienced over the past few years. In fact, I am so use to the antagonistic way I am treated that I prepare myself before making a call.  The whole experience of calling and speaking with the staff leaves one feeling anxious, disparaged and distressed. I am currently looking to re register myself and family with another surgery and follow many other of my friends and family who have already done so.  It is truly sad to have watched a brilliant Medical Centre go backwards and achieve ratings of (1) star.  The Doctors are brilliant when you can get to see them!

Thank you so much for your care and kindness it was much appreciated.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-11-14T19:09:06","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2022-11-15T11:02:11","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/997386?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"997386"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/997386/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"997386"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/997386/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"997386"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/997386/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"997386"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/b84006?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"B84006","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxious?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"anxious"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20listened%20to?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"not listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nuisance?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"nuisance"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/awful?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"awful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/teeth?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"teeth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/test?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"test"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/listened%20to?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/under%20pressure?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"under pressure"}]},{"id":994518,"author":"Moodwife","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Insulin Pump and Supply Issues","body":"I have have Type One diabetes and have been using a certain kind of insulin pump since February 2012. My pump was due to be replaced in February 2022 and the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast have not yet been able to provide me with the pump I have requested or a suitable alternative.  \r\nIn addition, I have been trying to contact Lurgan Hospital to get consumables for my out of warranty Insulin Pump for the past 3 weeks. The phone line is meant to be staffed from 1-4pm Monday-Friday. I have left at least 5 messages requesting consumables and a ring back. To date there has been no response. For the past 2 weeks the mailbox has been full, meaning no further voicemails can be left. I am now using a supply of pump consumables that a friend gave me when clearing their store cupboard. If it wasn’t for the fact that I extend the use of the pump cartridge from the recommended 3 days to 7 days and the cannula from 72 hours to 90 hours I would be without consumables for this life maintaining equipment for my out of warranty pump.  \r\nAs someone who works in the NHS I don’t complain about the services provided as I am very aware of the pressures on the service. However, this experience has now gone past the point of being mildly inconvenient to being disruptive to my self management. I have worked incredibly hard for the past 30 years of having Type One diabetes to not develop any complications so that I can continue to work. My most recent HbA1c was 43, my Time In Range is approximately 80% and I have so far avoided complications to my eyesight, heart, kidneys and digits thanks in no small part to the available technology. Since diagnosis, I have never been admitted to a hospital with diabetic ketoacidosis and have not had any admissions for severe hypoglycaemia outside of pregnancy.  \r\nI would appreciate a response as I do feel like I am shouting into a void. It really isn’t acceptable that my Type One friends are offering me consumables from their personal supplies.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-11-07T15:43:29.54","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-11-15T11:10:27.417","readBy":[{"name":"Southern Health and Social Care Trust","count":11},{"name":"St. Andrews University ScotGEM Medical Students","count":1},{"name":"Belfast Health and Social Care Trust","count":5},{"name":"Patient and Client Council","count":1},{"name":"Public Health Agency","count":1},{"name":"Ulster University, Faculty of Life and Health Sciences","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/994518?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"994518"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/994518/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"994518"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/994518/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"994518"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/994518/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"994518"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt001_11021_302?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"ZT001_11021_302","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_32022?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"ZT003_32022","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003-community-diabetes?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"zt003-community-diabetes","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diabetes?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"diabetes"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diabetic?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"diabetic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diabetic%20ketoacidosis?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"diabetic ketoacidosis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disabled?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"disabled"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disadvantaged?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"disadvantaged"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hba1c?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"HBA1c"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hypoglycaemia?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"hypoglycaemia"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/insulin?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"insulin"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/insulin%20pump?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"insulin pump"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/resources?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"resources"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/voicemail?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"voicemail"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diabetes%20type%201?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"diabetes type 1"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/no%20response?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"no response"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/replacement?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"replacement"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/telephone%20line?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"telephone line"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/997529?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"997529"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/999750?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"999750"}]},{"id":996403,"author":"heronbk64","authorRoleId":4,"authorRole":"a relative","title":"My elderly father","body":"My dear Dad has been in and out of the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital (QEUH) five times this year.  \r\nHe had a couple of falls at home resulting in a broken elbow and collarbone, it was touch and go when his stomach ulcer perforated.

They would not engage with any questions and got rid of me as quickly as they could by sending me for further hip x-ray. Following x-ray I waited, then I asked one of the assistants what would happen next, they spoke to the doctor, and came back to me and said There is no change, they don't need to see you.  \r\nI was later collected by patient transport, who were very kind and helpful, and taken home. I have no idea what will happen next.

I told the nurse i was unable to sit and she told me to see my doctor  (which i had already tried) . My daughters boyfriend brought me some barely water. Which seems to have helped 100%.

Fantastic team from start to finish starting with the booking teams who were super efficient getting me an appointment at my hospital of choice. Grantham endoscopy is always a 5 star service, big shout out to Karen, Sally and Jill. Suzanne on reception was very welcoming with her super smile, charm and efficiency checking my details thoroughly.  \r\nDebbie on admission, again service with a smile and in these circumstances is truly welcoming. Rosemary on cannulation duties, smooth and swift, ( I didn’t feel it honest). Not forgetting the room staff , mr Khoo, Jan and Jenny T making sure I was ok with a-bit of banter to lighten the mood. Lastly the recovery team Emma & Jenny H, of whom was on coffee duty, a welcome sight after 24hrs of no food and 5 packets of biscuits. All the other staff were equally as good even though it may have been a brief hello it’s nice they acknowledge every patient, so thank you to Bex, Louise D, Diana and anyone else whom I may have crossed paths with that day. Grantham Endoscopy truly is an amazing well led unit offering a brilliant service.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-11-11T21:23:04.6733333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-11-15T11:37:50.373","readBy":[{"name":"United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust","count":6}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/996473?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"996473"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/996473/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"996473"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/996473/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"996473"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/996473/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"996473"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rwdlp_104?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"RWDLP_104","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rwdlp_120-endos?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"RWDLP_120-Endos","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/colonoscopy?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"colonoscopy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/comforted?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"comforted"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/efficiency?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"efficiency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/receptionists?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"receptionists"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/recovery?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"recovery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/safe?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/team?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"team"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/well%20looked%20after?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"well looked after"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"amazing"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/998302?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"998302"}]},{"id":996658,"author":"Emmgh49","authorRoleId":8,"authorRole":"a staff member posting for a patient/service user","title":"I'm being treated very well","body":"I have been on this ward for one week, I have come across no issues, the staff are all very professional and friendly at the same time, so I feel comfortable talking to them as they really listen.
