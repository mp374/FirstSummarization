I feel there is no true joined up thinking when it comes to dealing with me. I am seen as complex and these days you are seen by a specialist in whatever area when something goes wrong. I feel waiting lists are pathetic, but once I was seen things may happen!  \r\nThis experience with the Northern Trust has been one of the best. The team who work to support patients who have chronic pain are just brilliant. I have learned a lot and have been able to make a number of changes to my lifestyle to help myself. In my opinion GP services are too quick to up the dosage of medication as they are not equipped with the knowledge to deal with people like me.  \r\nI am now able to drop the number of painkillers and medications to treat neurological damage and I feel so much better for it. I have changed how I manage the pain by listening to my body, resting and mindfulness. A bit of everything. The exercises are important too. I am hoping that I have the confidence to keep this going without their support. Sadly I am someone who does much better with someone watching me or in a group setting.  \r\nI would most definitely recommend this to anyone out there who really wants to make changes. I don't want to get addicted to medication. There are some which I know I have to take for the rest of my life and I really don't wish to have anymore which are a permanent fixture.  \r\nI know that because of my treatment and the aging process I will have other issues, so I am trying to do the best I can for as long as I can. With this teams help I feel that I can give it a good try.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-08-07T19:29:15.64","progress":"Story has a

An extra concern that a cancer patient does not need.  \r\nNext time not only will I worry about the scan results but also about the person carrying it out.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-08-12T11:55:48.1166667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-08-15T09:20:00.95","readBy":[{"name":"ACVO TSI","count":1},{"name":"Scottish Government","count":2},{"name":"NHS Grampian","count":4}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/965612?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"965612"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/965612/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"965612"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/965612/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"965612"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/965612/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"965612"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/n102h-radiology?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"N102h-radiology","score":1},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxious?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"anxious"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cancer?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"cancer"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/concerned?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"concerned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/empathy?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"empathy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/knowledge?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"knowledge"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professionalism?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"professionalism"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/radiology?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"radiology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scan?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/uncomfortable?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"uncomfortable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vulnerable?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"vulnerable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/i%20was%20taken%20on%20time?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"i was taken on time"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/966155?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"966155"}]},{"id":965622,"author":"Jessmac7","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"I was shocked at the way staff were spoken to","body":"I recently fell and broke my ankle. I attended A&E at University Hospital Wishaw at 11pm. Unfortunately due to staffing issues the minor injuries unit was closed and all staff were exceptionally busy. I was triaged very quickly and got an X-ray and was given painkillers. There was a very long wait which was clearly evident from the board in the department and whilst not ideal I knew what to expect. As a patient I appreciate how some people felt but I was shocked at the way the staff were spoken to by the people waiting. The staff were shouted at and received verbal abuse regularly. I would just like to say, the staff were obviously very much under pressure but when I was seen I was treated with curtesy and respect. Thank you for your care and to those who are abusive to staff, shame on you.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-08-12T12:28:03.6633333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-08-15T09:20:01.093","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lanarkshire","count":6},{"name":"Scottish Government","count":2},{"name":"Partnership for Change","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/965622?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"965622"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/965622/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"965622"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/965622/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"965622"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/965622/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"965622"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l308h_180?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"L308H_180","score":4},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/abuse?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"abuse"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ankle?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"ankle"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/courtesy?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"courtesy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fell?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"fell"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/long%20wait?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"long wait"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain%20management?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"pain management"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/painkillers?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"painkillers"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/patient%20behaviour?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"patient behaviour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/respect?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"respect"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/triage?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"triage"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/x-ray?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"X-ray"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/injuries?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"injuries"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/967628?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"967628"}]},{"id":966154,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"A&E were amazing from the start to discharge","body":"I visited on Saturday and was amazed at what the staff members have to experience  from people who shouldn't be there.\nI was treated promptly and with great care.

Calling later in the day will mean there are no appointments remaining, being told future appointments can't be made, and that you need to call back tomorrow. Everyone knows this, so everyone calls this surgery first thing in the morning.\n\nThis would be fine if this surgery had a phone system capable of handling this call volume. Call waiting technology has existed for 50+ years at this point, and has been standard for all GP surgeries I've ever interacted with in my life prior to this one. But instead of using an automated system to queue incoming calls, this surgery leaves you with a busy signal and your phone telling you to call back. \n\nTo successfully book an appointment with this surgery I frequently have to call upward of 100+ times. Literally. My call log often shows attempted calls in the triple digits when trying to make an appointment because the only success I ever has is in repeated redialing. \n\nThis is simply not acceptable. It wouldn't have been acceptable 30 years ago, and in 2022 it's really inexcusable that such a simple piece of technology that could significantly reduce patient stress at a time when they're likely to be feeling vulnerable hasn't been implemented.\n\nInvest in a modern phone system. Invest in online appointment booking so more tech-savvy patients can utilise this and leave the reception team free for those who need them most. Make some incredibly simple (and at this point, with all the off-the-shelf packages available, low-cost) changes. I understand that you are likely struggling with staff shortages, but rather than continuing to blame that for the abysmal experience patients continue to face when booking an appointment, take some basic steps to optimise the excellent staff you do have.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-08-15T08:26:49","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-08-15T10:23:49","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/966169?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"966169"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/966169/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"966169"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/966169/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"966169"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/966169/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"966169"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/g81075?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"G81075","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stress?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"stress"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/face?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"face"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20good?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"not good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vulnerable?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"vulnerable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/struggling?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"struggling"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/capable?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"capable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fine?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"fine"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/990988?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"990988"}]},{"id":966167,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Great Practice ","body":"Had telephone appointment at 8-30 this morning spoke to doctor who invited me in for a face to face appointment at 9-30 same day .Great service from the admin staff to the doctor also went in to see the doctor spot on time well done lane ends surgery on efficient service ","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-08-15T08:58:07","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2022-08-15T10:24:28","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/966167?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"966167"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/966167/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"966167"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/966167/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"966167"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/966167/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"966167"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/p81119?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"P81119","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/face?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"face"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doing%20well?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"doing well"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20great?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"not great"}]},{"id":966166,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"No answer ","body":"No answer to phone calls to make appointments.

The cleanness of the ward Is amazing, the cleaners work very hard.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-08-13T12:06:06.6966667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-08-15T14:29:31.437","readBy":[{"name":"Southern Health and Social Care Trust","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/965759?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"965759"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/965759/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"965759"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/965759/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"965759"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/965759/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"965759"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_32024-4-north-surgical?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"ZT003_32024-4-north-surgical","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cleanliness?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"cleanliness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/food?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"food"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/informative?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"informative"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/well%20looked%20after?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"well looked after"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/needs%20met?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"needs met"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kept%20updated?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"kept updated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/food%20options?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"food options"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/966681?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"966681"}]},{"id":965205,"author":"Ladyhendo16","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"My experience with Health visitors","body":"I have 3 children, one aged 16, 11 and 4. Each time I had very different experiences with the health visiting team.  \r\nWhen I had my oldest, I was very young myself, 17 going 18, intact! Although young, it wasn’t my first experience caring for a baby but still grieving from the loss of my father. I battled with the anxiety of something happing to my newborn and it soon spiralled into post-natal depression. The Healthvisitor I had at the time seemed nice but wasn’t very “coothie” and I didn’t feel I could open up to her, about how I felt things were going and being the young mother I was, I didn’t feel I got the reassurance I think I needed. I didn’t really like the idea of her coming and I would often reschedule and eventually relied on other people for advice ( which now I see, wasn’t a good choice either). It was made clear that her visits were solely for the welfare of my child. Latterly, another Healthvisitor would visit me and I really enjoyed her company and felt very much at ease because I felt that she spoke to me as a parent, rather than through a book.  \r\nWhen I had my middle child, 5 years later, I requested the Healthvisitor that I had latterly because I knew her and I felt very much at ease and at that time, my request was honoured. It was such a relief to myself and my husband because she knew how I was with my oldest and she knew me as a person and I felt that was personalised family care, which is how things should be! It helped to make my experience much more comfortable and I felt more secure as a parent. The birth of my son was quite traumatic, this time, so the warmth and care I received from this Healthvisitor was very welcomed and I felt like she was genuinely concerned for my welfare as well as my babies.  \r\nWhen I fell pregnant with my youngest child, I was an older mum, with a 7year age gap from my middle child, to my daughter being born. My circumstances were very much different and with working full-time (and unknowingly dealing with fibromyalgia) I was struggling physically. My daughter was 5 weeks premature, my uterus had ruptured ( which wasn’t discovered until her birth) and I had gestational diabetes throughout my pregnancy. This time I, again, requested my previous Healthvisitor but due to the change in GP practice, it couldn’t be done. However, the support I have received from the Healthvisitor I was allocated has been phenomenal. She become to know me as a mother and as a person, again this made the care and support more personal for me and my family and that’s what she always showed, that mattered most. I was encouraged, supported, made to feel valued as a mother and that my concerns were acknowledged and I was given advise on how to deal with things if that was what was needed. I always felt comfortable in her company, she was respectful and down to earth. I felt like I could take any advice she had to give and trusted her whole heartedly. I will always hold her in my heart for how she supported me and my family. ❤️","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-08-11T09:48:31.1166667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-08-15T14:33:23.3","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Tayside","count":9},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2022)","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/965205?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"965205"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/965205/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"965205"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/965205/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"965205"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/965205/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"965205"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/st9-community-services-hv-angus?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"st9-community-services-hv-angus","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nervous?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"nervous"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/advice?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"advice"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/birth?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"birth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/depression?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"depression"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fibromyalgia?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"fibromyalgia"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gestational%20diabetes?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"gestational diabetes"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pregnancy?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"pregnancy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pregnant?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"pregnant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/respect?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"respect"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/uterus?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"uterus"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/personal%20approach?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"personal approach"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/making%20sure%20all%20health%20visitors%20give%20the%20same%20care?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"making sure all health visitors give the same care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/become%20to%20feel%20valued%20with%20better%20healthvisitors?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"become to feel valued with better healthvisitors"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1031569?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1031569"}]},{"id":964671,"author":"alginon","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Wrong medication given","body":"Was admitted into Combined assessment unit in August, 2022. Was taken in by ambulance, who had my own prescription with them and they passed this on to the doctor. Was kept in for 6 days, after having bad seizures, headache, loss of balance and blurred vision. During the 6 days I was given medication morning and evening. I questioned the medication every time I was given it. I knew it wasn't the medication I normally took, each time I questioned it, I was told that this was what the doctor had prescribed. So thinking the doctor knows best, I took the medication.  \r\nOn the day I was told I could come home, and still not feeling right, a member of staff came to me and told me that they were very sorry, they had to tell me I had been given the wrong medication throughout my stay. Next, another member of staff came to see me from the hospital office, and also told me I had been given wrong medication, and that an investigation will be held. I came home that day with a list of the wrong medication.  \r\nI have no problems with the nurses care I received, They were all lovely.  \r\nI have had no notification whatsoever about this investigation that is supposed to be being held.  \r\nYesterday, I phoned the hospital to try and speak to the person dealing with this. After being passed from pillar to post, trying to find out which office deals with this, I was told there isn't an office in the hospital that deals with this problem. So I am still none the wiser.  \r\nA suggestion for the future - when a patient questions their medication, maybe staff should double check.  \r\nHad to go to my own GP recently. Still got symptoms mentioned above, they said this mistake should never ever have happened.  \r\nI am very upset and unhappy that I had had wrong medication and wasn't listened to.  \r\nI still don't know what is happening with the ongoing investigation.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-08-09T15:52:34.58","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-08-15T14:36:12.903","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Ayrshire & Arran","count":12}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/964671?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"964671"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/964671/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"964671"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/964671/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"964671"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/964671/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"964671"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/a111h_180?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"A111H_180","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/a111h-cau?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"A111H-CAU","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20being%20listened%20to?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"not being listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ambulance?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"ambulance"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/balance?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"balance"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blurred%20vision?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"blurred vision"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/contact?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"contact"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/headache?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"headache"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/information?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"information"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/investigation?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"investigation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lovely%20staff?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"lovely staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mistake?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"mistake"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/prescription?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Prescription"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unhappy?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"unhappy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vision?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"vision"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication%20error?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"medication error"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/non%20epileptic%20seizures?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"non epileptic seizures"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/966254?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"966254"}]},{"id":965212,"author":"Kelly/Fam","authorRoleId":4,"authorRole":"a relative","title":"Our mum is doing great","body":"My mum started with really sore legs.

Leaving this surgery the minute I can get in elsewhere.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-08-15T09:21:57","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2022-08-15T20:33:16","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/966287?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"966287"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/966287/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"966287"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/966287/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"966287"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/966287/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"966287"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/m84061?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"M84061","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/terrible?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"terrible"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/like%20myself?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"like myself"}]},{"id":966286,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Fantastic, Caring GP's","body":"I received an urgent appointment on the day due to my concerns and the GP I saw could not have been more helpful.

Now you can't get an appointment without creating a fuss. In general the patient facing (non-medical) staff are lovely but they are forced to work to a system which just isn't fit for purpose. When you do get to see a doctor they also are great - it just shouldn't be such a battle to do so. There doesn't seem to be any adherence to a 'duty of care' overall.\n\nTwice in the last week I've had to ring the surgery. The first time I had to try constantly to even get the phone answered only to be automatically put in a queue and then got cut off when the phone was eventually answered at the surgery. I then had to start again and finally got to speak to some one after 90 minutes of trying/queuing, only to be told there were no appointments (in fact, I was told there were no doctors on duty that day but I did get to see a lesser qualified clinician later the same day). The second time it was over 30 minutes before I got to speak to someone. This archaic system means that stress levels for all concerned are immense - patients, having to ring at a time many should be on their way to work or getting ready to do so and then being held in a queue for ages, plus the staff whose mental health must be affected by the stressed patients taking their frustrations out on them when its not their fault.\n\nIn my view patients need to be able to ring surgeries at a time to suit the patient not the surgery, the \"8 o'clock lottery\", as its 'affectionally' known needs to be knocked on the head ASAP. The surgery needs to employ enough staff to answer the calls within five minutes (or less) and office staff must be utilised to answer phones if that target is not being met. There should also be enough doctors on duty to deal with all the people who request to see them. In addition, patients should be able to see the same doctor most times they visit (allowing for holidays and home visit rotas). Since joining this surgery, when seeing the same doctor was the norm, I've been seen by more and more, and different, locums which doesn't give a good continuity of care or allow either side to develop a good professional relationship.\n\nThe fact that I, and many others, have felt it necessary to write a review such as this shows the surgery is failing its patients. Please put things right and make patients the top of your priorities as it doesn't appear to be the case at the moment.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-08-15T13:53:14","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2022-08-15T21:12:43","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/966301?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"966301"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/966301/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"966301"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/966301/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"966301"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/966301/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"966301"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/f81164?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"F81164","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stress?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"stress"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/concerned?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"concerned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/continuity?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"continuity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/get%20fit?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"get fit"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/head?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"head"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20good?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"not good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20concerned?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"very concerned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"put off"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20great?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"not great"}]},{"id":966315,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Waiting Times","body":"Current advice is ring daily at 8am to see if you can get a same day appointment, to book an appointment it will be about a 6 week wait.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-08-15T14:52:01","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-08-15T21:13:09","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/966315?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"966315"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/966315/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"966315"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/966315/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"966315"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/966315/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"966315"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/p86022?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"P86022","score":null},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/966878?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"966878"}]},{"id":966316,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"No duty of care for patience ","body":"I have been trying to get an appointment for quite a serious matter for 3 months.

We called in the morning to book an appointment for our 1 year old baby who's been having fever for the last 3 days, and the receptionist told us to call back at 2:00pm. We called back as she asked, only to be told that the appointments have been fully booked already for the rest of the afternoon and we have to call the following morning to book an appointment the next day. The reception also told us that we have in fact called at 2:25pm and not 2:00pm that's why the appointments ran out. On this basis, I called back again thinking it's reasonable to ask for an appointment for the next day, only to be told no several times despite explaining our concern and that we do have to ring again the following morning. There's no point asking 'what the problem is' when they answer the call as it doesn't feel like they're triaging the concerns and booking the appointment as per urgency, but rather on a first come first serve basis. The receptionist said that they are triaging the calls but this doesn't feel like the case when she said that there might be other sick babies also needing an appointment so I do need to call back.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-08-15T13:50:59","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2022-08-15T21:15:05","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/966313?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"966313"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/966313/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"966313"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/966313/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"966313"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/966313/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"966313"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/f86626?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"F86626","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/concern?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"concern"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frustrating?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"frustrating"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fever?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"fever"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/like%20myself?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"like myself"}]},{"id":966312,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Amazing GP","body":"The staff at Ailsa Craig Medical are brilliant including the admin staff.

I get through to the automated service which says \"to book, cancel, check or change an appointment please use the automated service. On using the automated service and entering the correct details the automated voice then says \"you have no appointments booked if you want to check or cancel an appointment\" etc and then back to the original automated message with no mention of booking an appointment or changing an appointment. \n\nOn checking the West Derby Medical Centre website it says 'You can book an appointment with the doctors online via the Patient Access system.' but when I access my Patient Access account, I receive the message 'Sorry, your practice does not currently have any appointment slots that can be booked online.' Which again takes me back full circle. Very frustrating. I know it's a very busy practise but modern communication systems could provide a more efficient system.
