Unfortunately I don't know the name of this practice nurse.  \r\nThe first screening took place in 2019. It was my first cervical screening, so I was experiencing some nervousness. The nurse instructed me to get undressed and then left me laying naked from the waist down for a good five minutes, with nothing to cover me, while she did something on her computer. This made me feel very uncomfortable and exposed. When she got round to the procedure, her approach felt lacking in care. She did not talk me through the procedure at all (which I feel should always happen when such an intimate test is being carried out, let alone when it's the patient's first time), nor did she warn me when the speculum was going in. I found the whole experience cold and unfeeling.  \r\nUnfortunately, three years later in 2022, my smear test was just the same. This time, I asked for something to cover me as I remembered what happened last time - and again nothing had been offered to me.  \r\nThe nurse did not talk me through the procedure, and in my opinion abruptly shoved the speculum inside me without warning and with what felt like minimal lubrication. The procedure itself was then very rough and somewhat painful, which it should not be. This made me feel really uncomfortable.  \r\nWhen carrying out such an intimate procedure that many people feel nervous about, I feel medical professionals should be employing a kind, clear, consensual bedside manner. I think they should always let you know when they are about to touch you or insert something into you. In my opinion this nurse's bedside manner is, quite frankly, crap. It is reported that the uptake of smear tests is so low and I think this is why!  \r\nIf I was someone who was scared of getting my smear, this experience would put me off going back.  \r\nCervical screenings are so important to get, so I feel medical professionals need to remember that there is an actual human being on the end of the speculum - please!","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-04-08T13:05:37.3666667","progress":"Change planned","dateOfPublication":"2022-04-15T09:20:01.147","readBy":[{"name":"City & Hackney GP Confederation","count":1},{"name":"The Riverside Practice","count":2},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2022)","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/930156?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"930156"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/930156/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"930156"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/930156/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"930156"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/930156/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"930156"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/f84619?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"F84619","score":2},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/feeling%20exposed?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"feeling exposed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lacking%20care?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"lacking care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nervous?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"nervous"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bedside%20manner?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"bedside manner"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cervical%20smear?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"cervical smear"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/consent?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"consent"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/experience?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"experience"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/explanation?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"explanation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/painful?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"painful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/practice%20nurse?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"practice nurse"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/rough?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"rough"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/smear%20test?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"smear test"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/speculum?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"speculum"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/uncomfortable?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"uncomfortable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unprofessional?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"unprofessional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unpleasant?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"unpleasant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unpleasant%20procedure?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"unpleasant procedure"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/932234?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"932234"}]},{"id":931098,"author":"capellabn38","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"This place is security bonkers","body":"There are many locked doors.

From being healthy prior to depression to being awful through it!  \r\nHaving been introduced to the dietician service through my GP, I worked with a dietician for approximately 6 months with appointments being frequent to begin with, and getting further apart over time. I was provided with fantastic support and input into decision making which helped so much.  \r\nSmall steps were required and initially the changes to my diet weren't about cutting out the poor food choices I had been making, but to add in positive choices.  \r\nInitially I committed to eating one piece of fruit per day - a food group which hadn't even registered in the previous few years. Such a small step was really tough, but made easier by discussing what fruit would be easy. Apple, pears and bananas needed no preparation so started on those. I didn't eat fruit everyday to begin with but after a while started to go for fruit as a snack over prepared foods such as crisps or chocolate.  \r\nEncouraged by this, other goals included reducing intake of certain food groups & drinks. Initially I reduced my intake of (sugar free) pop before removing it from my diet, replacing it with water or water with sugar free cordial. My bread intake had been nearing a loaf of bread daily. Working together we reduced that over time to 6 slices per day and have since reduced that to 4 slices per day.  \r\nWe looked at what a plate of food was to me and how it was composed, increasing the vegetable portion and slightly reducing the carbohydrate portion, although stressing to reduce this as it is key to a balanced diet, and not remove it! Then we reviewed portion size and I realised I was easily eating around 2 people's portions of a meal.  \r\nI struggled to reduce this until it was suggested that after cooking but before eating I refrigerate half of the meal making it more difficult to go back for seconds. This easy solution had such an immediate impact. The strange thing was, I didn't feel more hungry even though I was eating around half what I previously had been.  \r\nI hadn't eaten breakfast for years and that was the next thing we worked on. I now eat breakfast most days, not every day but I'm working on that still. I'm using pre-packaged porridge so I only have one serving - I found that my portion control was extremely poor when using normal porridge so conceded that using pre-packaged was necessary so I don't increase the portion size over time.  \r\nThrough this, I've found that my mental health is inextricably linked to my eating and although I have a way to go, not only have my blood sugar readings improved, but my mood has improved. I will have some improvements to make, but feel on the way to reversing my type 2 diabetes!","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-04-13T07:26:51.3033333","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2022-04-15T11:26:42.75","readBy":[{"name":"Scottish Recovery Network","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/931324?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"931324"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/931324/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"931324"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/931324/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"931324"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/931324/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"931324"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/h208h-weight-management?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"h208h-weight-management","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20sugar?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"blood sugar"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/depression?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"depression"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diabetes?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"diabetes"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diabetes%20type%202?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"diabetes type 2"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dietician?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Dietician"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fantastic?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"fantastic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/positive%20change?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"positive change"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/feel%20better?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"feel better"}]},{"id":931967,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Excellent practice","body":"Appointment was for 16.10, I was seen at 16.12, everywhere is spotless, my Partner has to Ipswich Eye clinic and she might have an appointment for 11 o’clock and sometimes we might be there until around 3 pm!

The relationship between all staff seemed respectful and good and I observed great courtesy between them even when there were crisis situations and pressure.They were very aware of the stress for relatives who had to wait outside because of covid and they gave them as clear a plan as they could of when they would be updated or able to see their loved one.I was discharge after being monitored and tested, with a follow up plan. On shift handover the senior nurse went round and thanked as many individuals on her shift for their support and at the end an announcement saying similar was made before the handover. The next shift were fully informed of my situation and seamlessly picked up with my journey of care.

Things seem to have improved significantly since the new phone system has been operational. Yes, there have also been times when I have felt the need to complain over the past couple of years however I must say my complaints were dealt with professionally and every effort was made to resolve my concerns.\nWhen I have got through to the 'right people' I am happy with my current treatment. I have used the surgery recently for myself and my mother which involved communication with receptionists, a nurse and a GP. To be honest I was expecting a lot of stress and anxiety trying to get appointments as I have experienced this in the past however all communication was far more positive than I expected from the onset. No long wait on the phone trying to get through, chirpy receptionist who was extremely helpful, as was the ones I dealt with when at the practice. The nurse was brilliant with my Mum who is deaf, and the GP I saw actively listened to what I said and followed up with a referral. So, all good and credit where it is due.\nI want to acknowledge the difficulties that all NHS services have had to endure throughout the pandemic, also the frustrations that ALL staff have undoubtedly had to put up with, having said that there are some staff at APS  that really would benefit from additional training in customer service, I think it is such a shame if a service receives an overall bad reputation due to the few that let it down. I have been with this practice for 51 years now and as frustrating as things have got for me at times, I am still there.

However nobody wanted to go to Dr at that time. In my total ignorance I wasn’t too worried as I believed skin cancer could just be removed from where it was, I had no knowledge of how melanoma could spread through the lymphatic and blood system. Perhaps that should be publicised more.  \r\nA year later when I rang my doctor with a photo, she saw me two days later and within less than a week I was at dermatology in Barnstaple for a first appointment, then within a week the nurse was removing it plus surrounding area and sending it off for biopsy. Wow amazing speed of treatment.  \r\nIt’s the waiting that seems worse in any cancer investigation, but I was also lucky to have the result sooner than the maximum time predicted. Worryingly it was found to be a stage 2a melanoma, 3.3 ml deep. The cancer nurse who gave me the news was at all times compassionate and professional, answering my questions. At a time when it was not allowed to bring a family member to a consultation, my husband was permitted to be there, which made me realise just how serious it was.  \r\nI can understand that nobody knows how their cancer journey may end, and many people would like to leave it that way. My nurse gave me information booklets and websites to gain information. I would always prefer to be told what the next steps are. Especially as the nurses are always there to support and I never felt left alone. Thank you.Then followed the trip to Exeter to see a consultant and the predicted delays because of covid. Not that we could really have afforded nor had any idea of the cost we had contemplated going private just to ‘jump the queue’ but were told it would be no quicker, with the consultant working all hours and out of hours on private patients. So we kept our faith with the NHS. Thankful that we did. I received an appt within four weeks to have a wider local excision a skin graft and lymph node removal.During several visits to Exeter, I received dressing care , the wound looking worse than I had imagined. Then came the next long wait to thankfully hear that the cancer had all been removed and none found in lymph nodes.  \r\nAgain I thought the wait was terrible and after the minimum time I rang Exeter for results. I do believe that had I not rung I may have had to wait till my consultant was back from holiday but as I was found to be all clear I was able to go to Exeter to be given the good news from a locum.  \r\nI can understand how some people prefer not to tell their immediate family as they are the ones who can do nothing but worry and ask you how you are and make you feel like you are reliving each stage.  \r\nThe positives were the compassion and professionalism of Barnstaple dermatology, the nurse who did the initial surgery, and the cancer specialists, both Nurses and Doctor. They now follow up with a full body check every three months, you forget how embarrassed you feel but being a woman who has had children that goes with the territory!  \r\nDuring Covid and lockdown, I had several short waits between procedures and waiting for results, I feel very lucky, considering the waits for surgery and appointments that others have had to endure.  \r\nA big negative is the travelling from north Devon to Exeter for so many visits, accentuating just how remote Barnstaple hospital is. I believe it is the most remote hospital in UK.  \r\nI had to leave home on the day of my surgery at 6.30 am to check in for 8am. I was told I would have surgery at 11am. At 3pm I was still waiting, nobody had given me any information about updated times. My elderly, diabetic husband was walking the streets of Exeter rather than drive home to return later. Eventually I was discharged at 7.30 pm. It would be good to think that day surgery could prioritise those who have to travel furthest and how they get there, but I can’t really complain when I hear of those who get ready for surgery only to be bumped.  \r\nMy GP had told me how much they would cut around the original freckle yet I was shocked when I first saw it after the WLE. It wasn’t painful, it was deep and wide. When the final nurse at Exeter doing the redressing told me to peel off any scabs I think that was wrong as those areas have left deeper scars than other parts. I also am amazed to see how much smaller the wound went from the size of half an apple when I first saw it to that of a £2 coin. The skin graft was probably the most painful, like a carpet burn, which bled quite a lot, but it healed quick enough. The scar from the lymph node removal pulled as it was glued with internal stitches. All scars eventually healed well but I think the staff at Exeter could have explained more what to expect.  \r\nI think the nurses at Barnstaple are amazing and patiently inspect every little freckle I find. They have answered any of my questions over the phone inviting me in to see them with anything I want checked. I can’t fault the care I have been given, especially when you hear on the news of patients with other needs, especially gynaecology, are still waiting.  \r\n[Unsure about 'Manager']  \r\n  \r\n[Unsure about 'Doctor']  \r\n","criticality":"minimally critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-04-13T15:04:51.26","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-04-16T08:20:10.803","readBy":[{"name":"Royal Devon University Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust","count":5},{"name":"Royal Devon University Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust (2)","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/931482?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"931482"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/931482/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"931482"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/931482/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"931482"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/931482/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"931482"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rbz12-dermatology?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"rbz12-dermatology","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rh801_330?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"RH801_330","score":3},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/biopsy?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"biopsy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/day%20surgery?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"day surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lymph%20nodes?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"lymph nodes"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/melanoma?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"melanoma"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scar?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"scar"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/skin?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"skin"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/skin%20cancer?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"skin cancer"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/skin%20graft?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"skin graft"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wound?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"wound"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassionate?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"compassionate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/explanations?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"explanations"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cancer%20surgery?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"cancer surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%20delays?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"covid delays"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/932317?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"932317"}]},{"id":931446,"author":"Chloe-Nicole B","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Kind and compassionate urgent care","body":"I attended Urgent Care/Zone B in mid April 2022.

Unfortunately the dept was really busy and understaffed due to covid, but the care I received was excellent.  Despite having to wait 15 hours before I got a hospital bed, they were so busy, I really felt for them.  They were working their best under extreme pressure.  Once on the ward all the staff were friendly, helpful and informative from the domestic staff to the consultants.  I received every test possible to find my diagnosis.  The only issue I had was lack of sleep due to being on a ward with very ill elderly patients who were noisy all night, either calling out  coughing or snoring.  They slept all day, so tended to be unsettled all night.  I left hospital exhausted and was so pleased to return home to finally get some sleep.  I appreciate this situation is probably unavoidable.  Thank you to all the staff at Bedford hospital.  Also to the lovely young lady who helped me when I collapsed in A and E, who herself was very poorly and had been waiting for several hours herself.

I was admitted to Green Square, then transferred to Royal Free. The stroke affected the right side of my body.  \r\nObviously, I was very scared and concerned for my future. From my past experiences with some of my family members and friends, I realised that my golden period of recovery is the first three months from the stroke. So I made a conscious decision that I need to get better no matter how little.  \r\nWith the help my therapists at Royal Free, Matt and Laura, I started to regain some of my mobilities. A big thanks to them for the skilful treatments, patient and constant encouragements. Of course, my gratitude to all the medical team there.  \r\nIn early April, I was transferred to NRC in Edgware. It was a more relaxed environment. I regained more mobilities as days go by. The team of therapists were wonderful, especially Selma. I could not thank her enough.  \r\nAt first they told me that I may have to stay here for up to six weeks, but after 10 days, I was ready to return home to continue my recovery journey. I returned home in mid-April.  \r\nThe only complaint I have was the food, it could be better.  \r\nThank you all very much for being there for me and keep up for your great works.

Minor point but very important for anxious parents ☺️","criticality":"minimally critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-04-13T18:37:18.6766667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-04-16T13:41:25.05","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":9}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/931514?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"931514"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/931514/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"931514"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/931514/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"931514"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/931514/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"931514"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sj9-children-day-surgery?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"sj9-children-day-surgery","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxious?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"anxious"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/check%20in%20system?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"check in system"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/day%20surgery?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"day surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/excellent%20care?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"excellent care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/explanation?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"explanation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"amazing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20at%20ease?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"put at ease"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/932302?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"932302"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/932315?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"932315"}]},{"id":931521,"author":"ospreybw98","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Efficient, professional whilst being personal","body":"I felt comfortable and appreciated.

Unfortunately I have to concur with the negative comments on the appointments system. It is so difficult if not impossible to contact the surgery by phone as it is constantly busy and/or there are extremely long waiting times. This would be okay but when you do get through there are no appointments left and you are told to call the next day after 8 p.m. and so it continues. It is fine calling later in the day but if you need an appointment you have to call as soon as possible after 8 a.m. to try and get an appointment. This is even the case if you have to see a doctor to receive test results which is worrying as understandably you want these asap especially if you might need medication or a referral - I found myself in this situation a few months ago.  The on line system is just as bad, especially if you are a bit slow like me, as by their own admission you have to log on asap after 8 a.m. when they press 'go' on the allocation of appointments for that day. The appointments that are left after this booking race which is what it feels like (if there are any) are weeks ahead. I have no problem with a phone call rather than f2f but these are not available either.  If there is a problem such as not being able to get a repeat prescription or any other pressing issue even when it isn't your fault you are expected to make an appointment to sort it out which in view of the above is very stressful especially when it can take so much time and effort and it is weeks ahead. This has made me feel very down when it happens as I am worried about the consequences on my health. I This doesn't happen that often thankfully and these things happen but there is a need to sort out any issues in the most timely and effective way.  I know the NHS and GP surgeries in particular are under extreme pressure but I can't help thinking that this approach is causing them more work in the long run.  I know there has to be a way of dealing with the high demands on the service but I do not know how someone who is very elderly or has a disability copes at all. I have raised this with the surgery in the past but was told that most people go on line and is is fine.  In summary I think the doctors, nurses etc. are very good but the system for booking and contacting them is poor and I am not sure if they realise that some of their patients are suffering these difficulties.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-04-16T07:21:22","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-04-16T14:03:07","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/932079?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"932079"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/932079/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"932079"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/932079/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"932079"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/932079/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"932079"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/h84020?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"H84020","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/worried?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"worried"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disability?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"disability"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/elderly?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"elderly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20good?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"not good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/okay?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"okay"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/test?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"test"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20worried?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"not worried"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fine?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"fine"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/under%20pressure?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"under pressure"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/945429?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"945429"}]},{"id":932127,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Extremely unsupportive ","body":"My partner and I came to bath hospital to receive help with my partners pregnancy as she was experiencing complications at just 5 weeks, upon many hours of waiting and different tests they told us that she had a miscarriage.

After 8 long excruciating hours all we left with was some antibiotics for the UTI and my partner and I received no sort of support or been referred to any sort of service to do with a miscarriage, This left us heartbroken and extremely upset as this is our first pregnancy and to receive no help or guidance at all is unremarkably appalling, Furthermore the staff seemed less interested in the fact that my partner has had a miscarriage and deemed the UTI more fitting to worry about. \n\nAlthough we may be young.
