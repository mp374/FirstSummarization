Their manner was incredibly nice, as was the first person I spoke to at NHS24.  \r\nI ended up trying anything yesterday after being in so much pain, I couldn't sit down or stand up, play with my kids or clean and tidy....  \r\nToday is almost unbearable again... However I've just discovered that the Doctor has already arranged a prescription for me at the local pharmacy.  \r\nCan I please say a huge thank you, the Doctor, and the a and e staff, as well as NHS24 at NHS borders, as today, and hopefully tomorrow, is going to be manageable. Thanks to your quick response.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-01-02T11:45:49.1466667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-01-05T09:01:24.713","readBy":[{"name":"NHS 24","count":35},{"name":"NHS Borders","count":11},{"name":"Office of Colin Smyth, MSP for South Scotland","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/906275?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"906275"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/906275/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"906275"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/906275/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"906275"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/906275/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"906275"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/b120h_180?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"B120H_180","score":5},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/nhs24?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"NHS24","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back%20pain?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"back pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/call%20back?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"call back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctor?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"doctor"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/manner?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"manner"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nice?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"NICE"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pharmacy?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Pharmacy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/prescription?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Prescription"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/quick%20response?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"quick response"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/response?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"response"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/valued?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"valued"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/no%20apology?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"no apology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/service?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"service"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/difficult%20system?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"difficult system"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/muscle%20spasm?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"muscle spasm"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/big%20thank%20you?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"big thank you"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/906725?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"906725"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/906737?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"906737"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/906768?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"906768"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/906776?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"906776"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/907312?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"907312"}]},{"id":906488,"author":"Emmrd63","authorRoleId":10,"authorRole":"a volunteer/advocate","title":"Supportive advocacy service","body":"Theresa was really helpful.

I hope the staff appreciate how valuable and appreciated they are and I give my thanks to the ward management for their execellent team.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-01-04T21:15:16.9933333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-01-05T10:38:32.02","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":8}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/906591?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"906591"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/906591/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"906591"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/906591/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"906591"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/906591/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"906591"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/g107h_180?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"G107H_180","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/a&e?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"a&e"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/excellent%20care?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"excellent care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/follow%20up%20care?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Follow up care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/timely?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"timely"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/urology?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"urology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thankful?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Thankful"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/907276?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"907276"}]},{"id":906592,"author":"Slyfox","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Staff lovely but better signage and care parking would help","body":"The nurse tried to explain it but finding the building wasn't easy.

But that’s exactly where we have been for the last few weeks. We were incredibly lucky and fortunate that all our investigations resulted in a good outcome but I just wanted to express my heartfelt thank you to Dr Ledingham and midwives Rhonda and Megan.  \r\nEvery consultation we had with them, whether in person for a chat, on the phone or in person for an invasive test was beyond anything we could have ever hoped for. They were incredibly professional and efficient but they all went about their work with such empathy and kindness. We were always made to feel like they had all the time in the world to sit and answer our many questions, when in reality it is a very busy department. No question was ever a stupid question and every answer was expertly and confidently answered in a way we would understand, whilst never shying from the truth or possible difficult outcomes. There are simply not enough words to describe the incredible care we received.  \r\nI too, work for NHS GGC as a nurse specialist, and I just hope that my patients leave my clinic feeling half as well cared for and confident in my care, as I did with fetal medicine. From the bottom of my heart - thank you to you all, and i truly hope you get the recognition you all deserve for your incredible work in a very busy and I am sure a very stressful and challenging department at times.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-01-04T16:30:49.0266667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-01-05T10:49:08.433","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":6}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/906487?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"906487"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/906487/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"906487"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/906487/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"906487"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/906487/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"906487"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sj9qe-501?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"sj9qe-501","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/above%20and%20beyond?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"above and beyond"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amniocentesis?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"amniocentesis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/consultant?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"consultant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/efficient?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"efficient"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/empathy?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"empathy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/exemplary%20care?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"exemplary care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kindness?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"kindness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/midwives?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"midwives"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professional?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"professional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20for?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confident?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"confident"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fetal%20assessment?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"fetal assessment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/listened%20to?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/excellent%20team?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"excellent team"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/906746?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"906746"}]},{"id":906477,"author":"Storygirl81","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"An ultrasound scan for potential breast cancer","body":"I went to the Mermaid Centre at Treliske hospital in Cornwall at the end of December after being referred by doctor to have a lump in my breast examined. The centre there is fantastic and the nurses were all great, but after the initial examination and mammogram I then went in for an ultrasound scan with a staff member who performed the scan; I found them to have some of the worst people skills for a person in that profession that I have ever come across and was truly awful. After examining me for a long time, the first thing they asked was whether I had anyone with me, which immediately made me hysterical.  \r\nThey then went on to say that they couldn't see on the scan what it was, and that I'd need biopsies done, but in their opinion it was cancer. Now this was done with no emotion, no care and so matter of fact it really was quite unbelievable. I have since been told by multiple people that they were in no position to be stating this to me as if it was fact, especially as I was informed at the same time that they didn't know what it was. It made me hysterical, and fearful for my life, at a time when it was still unclear what the problem was at all.  \r\nAt the time of writing this I still have not have the biopsy results back, 2 weeks later, and am now sitting here fearing the worst. I am due back there next Monday - so 3 weeks after the initial scans etc - and I will be refusing to see that staff member again. I don't want them anywhere near me. I understand that people just have a job to do and can't get emotional about things, but I do feel that there should be a level of care given and that telling someone that they probably have cancer just off the back of a scan and before any results have come through is pretty unacceptable.  \r\nThere was no attempt to make me feel better, or even just to say that they weren't sure and were going to do some biopsies just to see what it might be. I found the treatment to be harsh and I feel sorry for anyone else that has to come into contact with this staff member.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-01-04T15:00:32.9733333","progress":"Change planned","dateOfPublication":"2022-01-05T10:52:19.143","readBy":[{"name":"Royal Cornwall Hospitals NHS Trust","count":13},{"name":"Healthwatch Cornwall","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/906477?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"906477"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/906477/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"906477"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/906477/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"906477"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/906477/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"906477"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/ref12-mermaid-centre?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"ref12-mermaid-centre","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/worried?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"worried"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/biopsy?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"biopsy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breast?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"breast"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breast%20cancer?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"breast cancer"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breast%20lump?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"breast lump"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cancer?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"cancer"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/consultation?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"consultation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fearful?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"fearful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hysterical?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"hysterical"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lack%20of%20compassion?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"lack of compassion"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lump?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"lump"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mammogram?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"mammogram"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/people%20skills?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"people skills"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scan?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ultrasound?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"ultrasound"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/906765?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"906765"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/906773?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"906773"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/906799?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"906799"}]},{"id":906709,"author":"Jammy999","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Full sti testing","body":"Asymptomatic routine testing post-sex work.

Having had a previous, personal, negative experience when asking for help regarding a medical issue I was dubious as to if we would be acknowledged and helped or ignored and left to work it out for ourselves.  \r\nThe first contact we has was via email and contained an attachment of 2 referral forms that needed to be completed and returned, one for my partner and the other for myself. Due to the old format of the attachment we were unable to complete and return so I picked up the phone, pushed my anxiety to the side and explained our inability to complete and return the forms but emphasised that we were in desperate need of help.  \r\nAlthough the person was well spoken, friendly and listened to everything I had to say, their response of I could do it over the phone now but I only have my laptop and I don't think I have a copy on here. Just come in to the Centre tomorrow and speak to the receptionist, did not fill me with much confidence, nor did the staff member putting the phone down on me shortly after finishing this sentence.  \r\nNonetheless though the next day we walked to 45minutes to the city centre and filled the form out without any issues, within about 10 minutes of completing we were handed our individual, initial appointment cards. The person on reception went out of their way to get us appointments as soon as possible but also at the same time and date so we could be there to support each other.  \r\nAll we had to do was make it to the end of December 2021 and we would be on the road to a better, healthier future. Just knowing that there are people who genuinely want to help you and want you to do the best you can is a relief and a blessing in itself. My partner had been a user of this service many years ago and he was apprehensive as he felt he'd let his previous keyworkers down and that they would be disappointed with him, but this was not the case at all.  \r\nOne of his old workers actually took the time to come and say hello to both of us as we were waiting to receive our first prescription and reassured us that we'd done one of the hardest things already by coming in, admitting we had a problem and asking for help. As soon as my partner realised there was no disappointment, judgement or negativity you could clearly see the difference in his face, like a weight had been lifted off his shoulders.  \r\nWe have our first telephone appointment coming up this coming week and the difference is already amazing. If I can find a way to update you all I will. Anyone who is looking for help for themselves or maybe for a friend or loved one I cannot recommend Fitzwilliam Centre START service enough, they are life-changers and I already know that this is the best decision for our future and that they are going to be there to offer us all the support and any resources we could possibly need to succeed on our journey to become drug free once again.","criticality":"minimally critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-01-05T01:57:26.0633333","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2022-01-05T11:25:00.963","readBy":[{"name":"Sheffield Health and Social Care NHS Foundation Trust","count":4},{"name":"Healthwatch Sheffield","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/906597?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"906597"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/906597/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"906597"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/906597/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"906597"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/906597/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"906597"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/tah-drugs-opiates?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"TAH-drugs-opiates","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/addiction?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"addiction"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/drug?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"drug"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/heroin?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"heroin"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/informative?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"informative"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/methadone?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"methadone"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/patient?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"patient"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/personable?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Personable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/positive?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"positive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professional?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"professional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/trustworthy?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"trustworthy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/understanding?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"understanding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/empathetic?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"empathetic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/relieved?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"relieved"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"supported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/experienced?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"experienced"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supervised%20consumption?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"supervised consumption"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/service?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"service"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/some%20staff%20attitude?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"some staff attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/non-judgemental?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"non-judgemental"}]},{"id":906701,"author":"Jimpsy","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Difficult obtaining an appointment with GP","body":"Trying to secure an appointment with the family GP is hard enough but since Covid came around it is impossible to get an appointment with the family doctor without having to relay information like War and Peace to the receptionist.

Charlie took extra time to clean the blood from his blond hair as he knew he wouldn’t be able to wash it for 5 days and all the time keeping him happy and entertained with his stories about football. What could have been a very painful and upsetting experience for both myself and my son was made so much easier due to the quick service and fantastic Charlie. My son also received a lovely teddy and has since named him Charlie. Also a shout to the paramedic team who although stretched to the limits managed to keep in contact with us and find us the right place to go without the need for a long wait for an ambulance.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-01-05T12:10:11.3133333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-01-05T12:26:34.573","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Forth Valley","count":5},{"name":"Office of Murdo Fraser, MSP for Mid Scotland & Fife","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/906757?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"906757"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/906757/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"906757"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/906757/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"906757"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/906757/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"906757"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/stirling-ch-miu?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"stirling-ch-miu","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"blood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/brilliant?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"brilliant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fall?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"fall"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/paramedics?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"paramedics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/quick?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"quick"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/timely?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"timely"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/service?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"service"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/909955?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"909955"}]},{"id":906753,"author":"velark97","authorRoleId":1,"authorRole":"a carer","title":"A&E visit","body":"A big shout out for our NHS.  \r\nSpent the day at A&E Hairmyres.  \r\n(All fine, the next bit is the important bit)  \r\nWhile in the waiting area, I saw people being efficient.

In theatre, I was surprised and delighted when someone asked if I would like to watch the operation. 'Yes, please!' I replied, hardly able to believe my luck.  \r\nI found the whole procedure, which included chipping out a piece of bone and a wire insert, fascinating. There was no feeling in my leg or foot, which was a weird sensation, especially when they lifted what seemed to be someone else's limb into position. Some people have called me brave, which I don't deserve because I felt completely safe, and because it was only like watching an operation on a dead chicken.  \r\nI would like the whole team and others to know how much this ability to observe and learn meant to me. Being watched by a patient may have felt uncomfortable to some staff, I shall never know, but it was a truly patient-centred, a partnership which contrasted vastly with my medical past. 'Them and Us' morphed together to make 'We'.  \r\nBy inviting me to watch they had left themselves vulnerable to criticism of any obvious mistakes that might have occurred. But importantly, by trusting me they had shown me respect. They had treated me as a Person, rather than just some Thing. This insightful, modern attitude continued in the Recovery Room. Sadly, I was unable to access the online Survey about this experience, but I'm writing here because I would like the whole team and others to know how much this good experience meant to me. It showed a degree of the team's self confidence, which in turn boosted my confidence in them and contributed towards a fruitful staff/patient relationship.  \r\nI know I need to get out more, but this hospital experience was a highlight in my week!  \r\n[Unsure about 'Staff attitude']  \r\n[Unsure about 'Staff skills']","criticality":"minimally critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-01-05T11:53:13.3533333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-01-05T12:44:08.12","readBy":[{"name":"Healthwatch North Yorkshire","count":1},{"name":"York Teaching Hospital NHS foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/906752?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"906752"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/906752/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"906752"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/906752/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"906752"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/906752/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"906752"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rcb55_110?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"RCB55_110","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/attitudes?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"attitudes"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bone?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"bone"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/foot?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"foot"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/insightful?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"insightful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/observation?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"observation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/operation?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"operation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain%20free?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"pain free"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/patient-centred?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"patient-centred"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/spinal?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"spinal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/spinal%20anaesthetic?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"spinal anaesthetic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thoughtfulness?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"thoughtfulness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/toe?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"toe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confidence?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"confidence"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/canula%20fitting?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"canula fitting"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treated%20as%20a%20person?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"treated as a person"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20safe?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"very safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attitudes?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"staff attitudes"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/910374?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"910374"}]},{"id":906744,"author":"moongx74","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Contraceptive pill","body":"I spoke to someone about accessing the contraceptive pill and recieved informative and helpful advice as to which one to take.

I contacted my doctors surgery today to ask for a nurse to come and give me a b12 booster. I am unable to get to the surgery because I have a double ankle fracture and a lisfranc fracture. I’m currently on week 10 of recovery and although I’m practicing partially weight bearing I am still very much house bound. The reply from nursing was that because I can walk and because I get to hospital appointments they won’t see me. I am very disappointed by this response and feel that there is a complete lack of care and compassion. I am unable to drive and my husband works full time and we have two young children. I would not be requesting this care if I didn’t need it.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-01-05T11:39:36.3233333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-01-05T12:57:12.303","readBy":[{"name":"Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust","count":7}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/906749?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"906749"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/906749/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"906749"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/906749/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"906749"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/906749/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"906749"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rha-ch-lbcn?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"rha-ch-lbcn","score":2},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disappointed?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lack%20of%20care?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Lack of care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/district%20nursing%20team?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"district nursing team"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/home%20visit?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"home visit"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassion?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"compassion"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/907317?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"907317"}]},{"id":906764,"author":"Jadeymcc","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"amazing maternity care.","body":"I have had all of my children in the maternity and every time they are outstanding!

The doctor was amazing as he was able to explain to me what this was and what the treatment process was going to look like. My child had to go into surgery and I feel this is a scary moment in any mothers life having to put your child through this, but it had to be done for him to get better.  \r\nThe whole time I felt so nervous and anxious but there was one nurse who was so lovely and kind as she came over to me and comforted me about the whole situation.

When I walked into the day surgery unit, I was immediately made to feel reassured, and the registration could not have been better. When I walked into the theatre and saw a team of 5, I suddenly realised the biopsy is not an insignificant procedure, but it was conducted so efficiently and with minimal fuss, the stress levels were massively reduced. In hindsight the biopsy is a gruesome experience and as the day approached for my admission, I was becoming more tense. Not sure whether online video depictions of the procedure helped or not. Anyway it is now done, my recovery has been without problems and I move on. A massive thanks to them all.

I was unable to pursue a career even though I had a good Grammar School education in Dartford, Kent.  \r\nNow I am a widow and able to take out private medical insurance so that I get proper care when I feel poorly.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-01-05T09:28:18.0966667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-01-05T14:01:57.48","readBy":[{"name":"Kent and Medway NHS and Social Care Partnership Trust","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/906717?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"906717"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/906717/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"906717"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/906717/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"906717"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/906717/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"906717"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rxy_710?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"RXY_710","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/angry?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"angry"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/alone?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"alone"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bipolar?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"bipolar"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/depression?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"depression"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/social%20services?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Social Services"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/907002?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"907002"}]},{"id":906787,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Excellent patient care","body":"Called in today to ask about having a flu jab.

I live out of area but was happy to travel. There is always parking and the location of the hospital is easy to get to. \nI work also work for the NHS in the community services for children and young people so understand how challenging it can be to provide high quality care at this time and was ready to ‘overlook’ minor issues however this was never necessary because there weren’t ANY issues. And nothing was ‘just acceptable’ but very much outstanding. \nThe online maternity notes were helpful meaning I could access my information, see updates, send questions regarding my pregnancy at any time which were promptly responded to. \nThe antenatal clinics always had a very calm environment and every staff member I encountered was friendly, smiling, polite, professional and helpful. I felt listened to, encouraged and included in the decisions of my care.\nThe maternity ward was again a very calm and surprisingly quiet environment. The ward seemed full of patients and staff shortages but remained calm and nothing was too much trouble. All staff went above in the care provision. \nMy son had a tongue tie picked up with the first 15 minutes of his birth and an appointment was provided within a week which seemed reasonable to me given current waiting times elsewhere. One maternity support worker wasn’t satisfied with this (aware of the problems that would arise for my son and also myself breastfeeding) and persisted in her communication with colleagues which meant a tongue division was completed the morning after he was born. He could feed well and I avoided painful breastfeeding issues because of it.\nMy stay was during the winter and peak of staff off sick with coronavirus (as highlighted in the news) but at no point did staff mention, complain or use this as an excuse which is incredible as they would of had every right to explain this. They smiled and kept the focus on the mother’s and newborns, ensuring that everyone’s experience remained personal. Nothing was rushed and I felt completely cared for and supported in caring for my baby. Every staff member contributed to that calm environment and kept a high level of professionalism whilst showing compassion and also a friendly atmosphere not only towards the patients but also to each other which is probably why it felt so relaxed to stay there. \nSo to everyone at the Royal in Maternity services (and also in theatres for the c section) thank you endlessly!! Incredible honest, kind and professional care. A complete example to other hospitals of how it can be done in the face of current endless challenges. A very positive experience at a special time that I will remember forever and tell everyone about.\n\n","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-01-05T07:00:29","progress":"Story has a

Not feeling too great anyway, so I’ll best be hitting bed early with a hot drink.  \r\nThen it comes, hits my chest like a wave of lead, leaves me breathless, reeling, fearful of more too come. Get the phone while I still can. Just me on my own these days, and these past few months have taught me to be prepared, self sufficient, less fearful of the unexpected...  \r\nBut this whooshing sensation inside has “fearful” written all over it, all coiled and taut, perhaps to hint at worse to come? There are times when to hesitate can save face later. This isn’t one of those.  \r\nI make the call.  \r\nTwenty minutes later two ninja medics whirl around my room, set up some gear, reassure me with their purposeful presence before taking in my data - telemetry, they call it. Blood pressure and heart rate: not quite as explosive as I’d feared, I’m glad to hear, but deffo worth a closer look, they reckon in that bulletproof pleasantness that I’ll get to meet very up-close and again and again these next three days.  \r\nOnce strapped into the ambulance heading for Perth and having a wee chat with the medic, that crushing pressure inside me has almost lifted and I feel a bit of a fraud to be honest. But once through A&E things become clearer. That punch I’d felt had indeed been a heart attack, albeit a minor one. So, good call, after all.  \r\nIt’s nearly 3 AM by the time they wheel me up to the HDU - high-dependency unit. But you wouldn’t know it. The nurses are engaging, wide-awake, and happy to hear my backstory all over again, understanding of my frazzlement with all that’s washed over me these past three hours. I tell them this is my first ever overnight stint in hospital - honestly - and they smile politely, not least by way of offering me tea. Sure, they’ve seen it all, and often. But that doesn’t make any of them seem bored. I drift off at last, to the polite chimes of overhead vitals monitors, four in this room alone, hi-tech, just like you see in the movies. The one above me displays my very own name. Which, for so many reasons, has me weep, quietly.  \r\nTests, tea and talk, the latter much needed by me after my boring Sunday that never was. All part of the reliable undercarriage to bear my hopes and fears through two uncertain days. And then, reasonably good news: the angiogram (quite the cyber-busting procedure involving long thin wires and tiny tubes to scrub and repair damaged heart arteries) had worked well, and together with a cornucopia of pills should restore my 61-year-old ticker back to near-normal for its age. My relief - their reward. And yes, it’s massive, for all of us.  \r\nI write this wee story reclining on my trusty ward bed and awaiting a taxi to take me home. It’ll feel a little different, my home, I’m guessing, now that I’ll see it with slightly wider eyes. And for that and much besides I’d like to very much thank the unflappable nurses and doctors at Perth Royal Infirmary and Dundee’s Ninewell Hospital (angiogram), as well as the indefatigable ambulance teams who ferried me through this unexpected inner-space adventure. Special thanks to Stewart, Denise, Yvonne, Kevin, Christi, and not least Ashley - you all know who you are.

I saw different midwives and doctors each time but felt I was in safe hands.  \r\nI was induced at 39 weeks due to my age (I'd also had a day of monitoring the baby for a high heart rate at my 38 week appointment, so although it was just an active baby, it made me more agreeable to induction). I'd had two natural births previously and wanted it to be as natural as possible so opted for the outpatient balloon method. This went well, everything was clearly explained and the doctor checked I was okay throughout. I was even offered gas for the discomfort (which I didn't need).  \r\nAt home I experienced contractions and cramping and around midnight the balloon fell out. I called maternity assessment who were lovely and supportive and agreed that I would try to get some sleep as my waters hadn't gone yet and to keep my appointment to have my waters broken. In the morning my mucus plug had come away but I didn't have contractions or a loss of waters so attended the induction ward for my appointment.This is where I feel that things started to go wrong as the original plan changed and not really for any medical need for me or my baby but more due to staffing/ how busy they were. Firstly the doctor was delayed due to an emergency (fair enough), and then when a doctor did examine me they said that although they could break my waters but there wasn't space for me in the labour ward. So, they were just going to give me Prostin gel as I was there anyway and it would help shorten my cervix more. They didn't give me the option to go home and come back (which might have been better given there was no space in the labour ward for me - so why put me into labour?). I didn't know much about the gel because it wasn't part of my induction plan so I didn't know it could cause hyperstimulation and this wasn't explained to me either. Just over an hour later I was experiencing hyperstimulation as I was contracting with less than a minute apart. I asked the midwife if this was normal as in my previous labours they weren't as close together and as strong until I was close to giving birth. They said they could be Prostin contractions and could ease off. I wasn't put on the monitor which might have shown what they were like. In fact at no other point during the next five hours in the induction ward was my baby's heart rate monitored. Despite intense contractions lasting 45 seconds and 20 seconds apart. I found this concerning because everything I've read about hyperstimulation says that the heart rate should be monitored. At the time however I didn't know this was unusual, my concern was around the horrific pain I was struggling to cope with and whether I was going to make it to the labour ward to give birth- there was one point in the toilet that I was sure I was going to give birth there, and the pressure and frequency of the contractions made me feel out of control (like the feeling of transition in my previous labours). I told the midwife of my concerns because in my first labour I needed to send my husband to look for a midwife when I needed to push and my second labour was 2 and a half hours long despite being back to back. I found the pain from this labour far worse than my previous labours but managed to get pain relief that made those births manageable. I was only able to have one dihydrocodeine tablet and two paracetamol on the induction ward. This really didn't feel enough to help me stay in control. I felt I was almost hyperventilating, my body was shaking, I was sobbing with tears streaming down my face uncontrollably, and this escalated to screaming where I could not stop myself - all in a ward where the other patients and their partners could hear. I felt that I was probably going to have to give birth there and despite being in this state I felt I was still not a priority for the labour ward. As whilst I was hysterical like this a midwife came to collect another patient who was ahead of me in the queue - they were not in active labour and were able to chat away and walk off with them. Whilst I don't know their circumstances, it really didn't help me to see that. Eventually the midwife agreed to examine me ( They had been reluctant to earlier) but did so at around 7.40pm - they found I was 4cm dilated. Just after 8pm I was taken to the labour ward (labour ward midwives were great) I able to have gas and air and my baby monitored (though their heart rate dropped and I had to move onto my side). My waters were bugling and when they were broken everything intensified. I was about to be given morphine , I'd been begging for an epidural, but it turned out to be too late as I rapidly dilated from 5cm to 10cm in around ten minutes. I have never felt pain like this in my life - I didn't think it could get any worse and I remember feeling like I could die from the pain. Fortunately though as soon as I was fully dilated I gave birth in one push (I don't think I could have stopped it to be honest). our baby was born within 30 minutes of getting to the labour ward and I was in shock with a 2nd degree tear. Mentally I have struggled to come to terms with this birth experience even though we are both okay- the fear of what could have happened to my baby, the lack of control/autonomy and pain that I experienced.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-01-03T02:34:22.6366667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-01-05T16:51:24.41","readBy":[{"name":"Office of Clare Haughey, MSP for Rutherglen","count":1},{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":8}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/906333?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"906333"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/906333/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"906333"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/906333/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"906333"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/906333/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"906333"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/g108h_501?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"G108H_501","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/g108h-labour?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"g108h-labour","score":3},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/afraid?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"afraid"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bed%20availability?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"bed availability"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care%20plan?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"care plan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/contractions?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"contractions"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gas%20and%20air?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"gas and air"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/giving%20birth?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"giving birth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/in%20pain?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"in pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/induction?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"induction"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/informed?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/labour?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"labour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/maternity?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"maternity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/midwives?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"midwives"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/monitoring?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"monitoring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/morphine?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"morphine"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20believed?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"not believed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain%20relief?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"pain relief"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/induction%20ward?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"induction ward"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/907358?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"907358"}]},{"id":906858,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Shocking customer service, always at “full…","body":"Whenever I try booking an appointment, I am very rudely told to ring back at 8am the following day.

My mother waited by her landline phone until 18:30 with no call from the doctor. On previous occasions, I have used on her behalf the askmygp application, so the following day opened the app and found a message informing my mother someone would phone in 3 days. I reviewed the information which had been submitted by someone unknown to either my mother or myself and found it greatly understated her illness. My points of concern are:\n1. why use a method of communication not instigated by the patient, or inform the patient to look at the application for updates? (when I use the application I always state it is on behalf of someone) \n2. the clinical information entered was not correct, is this information entered by a clinically trained person able to interpret what the patient is saying? if the information is transcribed all details should be entered not the high lights as important information is missing.\nThis is only the latest disappointing care interaction's with Tower Healthcare I would move my mother to another GP practice but unfortunately Tower Healthcare have the monopoly within walking distance for my mother.\nHughly disappointed in the ability to access care.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-01-05T08:50:45","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2022-01-05T19:12:44","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/906873?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"906873"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/906873/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"906873"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/906873/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"906873"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/906873/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"906873"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/p83012?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"P83012","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/concern?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"concern"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disappointed?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/important?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"important"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20disappointed?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"very disappointed"}]},{"id":906872,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Frustrated again ","body":"My daughter regularly seems to get tonsillitis, a week or so before Christmas she was prescribed some antibiotics again and told to ring for a follow up prescription if the problem had not gone away completely when she had finished the tablets. As suggested she contacted the practice again and she spoke to a different doctor, he refused to give her another prescription, sure enough the tonsillitis came back again. Early in the new year she developed a sore throat again, the first day after the bank holiday at the earliest opportunity she tried to ring again for an appointment, she rang continuously for some considerable time and as usual it took a long period until she could actually speak to a receptionist, she was told no appointments were available that day and to ring at 8 in the morning as it was not possible to prebook appointments. She had to go to work the next day so I rang on her behalf, I began ringing just before 8 and managed to get through quickly, however the receptionist couldn’t hear me and after two hellos hung up!\nIt then took in excess of 50 attempts redialling  to get through to the first message when you have the option to book an appointment, this took over 21 minutes, it then took another 15 minutes or so to speak to a receptionist who could hear me this time, she was very helpful in making an appointment and also then getting me the email address to use for a complaint.\nTwo points here, firstly if there are no appointments left that day either offer the facility to book the next day or have the option to have a message saying ‘sorry no further appointments available today’ secondly invest in a better system or more people to deal with the large number of phone calls which result in the delays and cause frustration of patients trying to get through!
