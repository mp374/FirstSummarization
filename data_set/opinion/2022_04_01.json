Finally received a telephone appointment of all things, which lasted 5 minutes in total, to be told I would be sent for a CT scan and then a follow up appointment face to face. The appointment duly arrived and I attended but this was around two months ago. No communication since then and no results. Phone call today to enquire when this would happen, only to be told I am on another waiting list. I was asked if I would like a telephone call to hear my results. My answer was yes, but I thought that this would happen routinely as good practice. Had I realised I had to ask, I would have phoned weeks ago to get put on that waiting list. I can appreciate the whole COVID thing, having worked through the whole thing, and still managing to provide safe face to face patient care.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-03-31T08:25:13.1766667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-04-01T08:22:18.04","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Borders","count":4}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/928014?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"928014"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/928014/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"928014"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/928014/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"928014"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/928014/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"928014"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/b120h_120?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"B120H_120","score":1},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ct%20scan?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"CT scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/extremely%20frustrated?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"extremely frustrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gp%20referral?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"gp referral"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/information?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"information"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/results?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"results"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/telephone%20appointment?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"telephone appointment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting%20list?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"waiting list"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appreciative?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"appreciative"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20safe?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"very safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"covid"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/face-to-face%20appointments?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"face-to-face appointments"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/928366?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"928366"}]},{"id":927931,"author":"saturnpk74","authorRoleId":4,"authorRole":"a relative","title":"My Father","body":"My father was admitted to GRI Emergency Department after a collapse at home where he fell downstairs.

He returned at 7am next morning and was given an xray and a brace no pain killers but advised to take ibuprofen and see GP if any concerns. He was told he would be contacted by a virtual orthopaedic clinic. We were contacted by an orthopaedic nurse two days later who gave conflicting advice from hospital as they said don't take ibuprofen, they couldn't answer our questions we didn't know if it was best he put weight on it, or rest it, the nurse just kept repeating it would depend on how stable the knee was, but we didn't know what that meant. We came off phone, confused and frustrated as we had no idea what was happening.  \r\nMy son attended a clinic appointment in Monklands a couple of weeks later, he was sent for MRI that day and had to attend physio that day also. There was a sense of panic and we could tell something was wrong. He was later told his knee would require surgery for a ACL injury. My son is unable to walk any distance as the knee gives way randomly, he is a musician and was in his 3rd year at university, he has had to take a year our, give up his job and stay at home whilst he awaits surgery.We have been so sympathetic to the situation going on in hospitals due to covid and staffing issues, so we have been patient and just awaiting a letter. However come March we had heard nothing, my son is still in pain, on regular medication, and is unable to go about his life normally. So we thought we would give hospital a phone for update. He was told he was a priority but also that he wasn't on the schedule which had been done until 21st March, so to give them a call back then. I explained we would take a cancellation, any day, any where as his life is basically on hold. It has been 6mths and I fear for his mental health as its been awful for him not being able to get on with life like a normal 21 year old.  \r\nI called back today, to be told he is not scheduled for surgery and they cannot give me an idea of when as surgeries as present are canceled once more. My son was devastated by this, he is hoping to return to university in September, return to work by the summer but it is looking less likely as time goes on.  \r\nWhat made today worse is when I commented on a local group for ACL injuries I read that someone got their surgery 2 weeks ago, they only had their accident six weeks ago but apparently they called coordinator and explained how their daughter's schooling and mental health was being impacted and this was seen as a priority. Surely a young man who's life has been turned upside, who has been unable to continue his education and is unable to walk without pain or fear of falling should also be a priority.  \r\nFrom the start we have been messed around,from that first visit to a&e when we were advised to go home, to the virtual appointment that was unable to answer any of our questions. To now being told, that he has been on the waiting list the longest but there is no date for his surgery. How long will this continue?","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-03-31T17:11:21.9833333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-04-01T09:09:03.493","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lanarkshire","count":16},{"name":"Scottish Government","count":1},{"name":"Partnership for Change","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/928154?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"928154"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/928154/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"928154"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/928154/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"928154"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/928154/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"928154"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l106h_110?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"L106H_110","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l308h_110?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"L308H_110","score":1},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l308h_180?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"L308H_180","score":1},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/angry?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"angry"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disappointed?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/a&e?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"a&e"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/accident?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"accident"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fall?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"fall"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/injury?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"injury"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/knee?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"knee"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mri?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"MRI"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/physio?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"physio"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/xray?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Xray"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/conflicting%20information?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"conflicting information"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wait%20for%20surgery?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"wait for surgery"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/931455?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"931455"}]},{"id":928362,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Went out of their way to help me","body":"I have always found this surgery to be incredibly flexible and helpful to me.

I was so touched by this. This immediately helped reduce my anxiety. Not that I think the staff would have known the impact that left. THANK - YOU! From the Anesthetic team who showed empathy and reassurance without making me feel like a problem or silly for having such emotions right through to the recovery ward staff. They were attentive and equally amazing at making the experience one that even with chronic wind pain left me with a feeling of dignity and respect. With each department that I went through during the day the staff were friendly and approachable. Checking on how I was feeling, to making sure I asked for help when I required it. Thank you to the staff who greeted me at the entrance right down to the Nurse who saw me out. Management should know that each and every staff member were praiseworthy and must be commended on a job well done. Please make sure that this department know how well they did, especially given how anxious I was when I went in.

Following that phone call I was given an appointment for the treadmill test on Tuesday morning.  \r\nI attended the treadmill test and was well looked after by staff who put me at ease. In less than an hour, I went through the cardio test and was given verbal feedback (which was very reassuring) by the charge nurse.  \r\nShe further explained that I would have a follow-up phone appointment with my GP in approximately two weeks once her report was received by the GP practice.  \r\nAt a time when the media seem highlight only 'bad news stories' about NHS Scotland, I feel strongly that this very 'good news story' should be highlighted.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-03-31T22:41:59.9233333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-04-01T09:50:10.133","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lanarkshire","count":5}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/928250?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"928250"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/928250/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"928250"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/928250/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"928250"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/928250/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"928250"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l302h_320?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"L302H_320","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20tests?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"blood tests"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/chest?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"chest"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/test?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"test"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassuring?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"reassuring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/referral%20speed?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"referral speed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/prompt%20appointment?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"prompt appointment"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/930340?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"930340"}]},{"id":928381,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Excellent Care","body":" I want to commend you on the excellent care given to me yesterday during my MOT.

They had no face to face appointments left. \n\nI understand that some system is needed for allocating appointments but there are three big problems with the current 'phone at 8.30' model:\n\n1. Parents with school or nursery age children, people who work nights and many others find it extremely difficult to sit by the phone repeatedly calling at 8.30am. There needs to be another way to see a medic. It is not safe to be making repeat phone calls while walking a four year old plus baby to school.\n\n2. We then have to be ready to accept a phone call at any time that morning. That is unrealistic for tonnes of people, including people who can't answer calls all the time, i.e. those who work in call centres, social care, healthcare or education, and many others. If you miss the doctor's call, you usually have to start the whole nightmare of trying to get an appointment all over again the next day. If you do take the call and the doctor then wants to see you, this is very hard if you don't work from home - a teacher can't just leave her class with no notice, etc. There needs to be a way to agree an appointment time at the time of booking and ideally to be able to book a few days ahead sometimes so that life can be planned around it.\n\n3. There clearly just are not enough appointments for everyone that needs them, and this calling system is an unofficial and arbitrary form of rationing. Many people will give up before reaching call 115 (or more), not because they don't need help but because they are too ill to stick at it or have other responsibilities that they cannot leave for so long. Many others get turned away if they call a little later. I know there is an NHS funding crisis but it is important that you understand just how many people are seeking healthcare and being turned away, without it ever being recorded as they never even get through on the phone. This can lead to people getting help much too late.\n\nI would be grateful if you could consider how you can open up more appointments at the Borchardt and how you can allow people with varied circumstances to access healthcare if this 8.30 calling system doesn't work for them.\n\nMany thanks otherwise for the excellent care and service from all your staff.\n\nLaura","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-04-01T08:55:39","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2022-04-01T10:10:21","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/928393?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"928393"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/928393/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"928393"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/928393/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"928393"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/928393/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"928393"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/p84010?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"P84010","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/crisis?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"crisis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/excellent?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"excellent"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/face?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"face"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/important?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"important"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/safe?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20grateful?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"very grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thanks?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"thanks"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20home?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"at home"}]},{"id":928392,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"More organisation needed","body":"My experience of derby royal A&E is not good after sitting there this week for 14 hrs , in my opinion you need to be triaged as you walk in it would probably of cut my time down by half  giving the time to more urgent cases , i understand there is a shortage of medical staff who were all doing an amazing job from what I could see , receptionist not so good quite rude and no compassion.

They took a swab when I arrived and was told that it would take about 24 hours to check that I was Covid negative. I wore my mask at ALL times both going to meals and getting a brew. I ate my meals in my room but was constantly harassed by one nurse who complained if I just went to make a drink myself while wearing my mask. I complained about this person's overbearing behaviour to another nurse. A text message arrived confirming I was Covid negative and I told a nurse on the late shift the same day who reaffirmed I was Covid negative and that I was free to go out of my room. The following day I approached the first nurse about the text message and was told that the message had not come from them, so I would have to continue to isolate. I felt like I was being treated this way because I had complained. The whole time I felt ill at ease and it was like pulling teeth asking some of the staff to help you with something. It seemed to me that it was ok for some of the staff to be rude to you but, if you were rude to them they let you know about it. Requests were frequently ignored and if they did something for you it was often at staff's leisure or not at all. Staff seemed to spend a lot of their time in the ward office and didn't appear to be doing anything. One particular time I was in the common area in front of the ward office and the door was ajar and I could hear the staff openly talking about patients in a very derogatory manner, they abruptly shut the door when they realised people could hear them. One day I saw my name was on the notice board for a ward round the following day. On that day I asked if I could go to my flat to wash my clothes as the dryer on the ward had been broken since I first got there. I was reminded that I had a ward round. I left the ward early in the morning and walked back to my flat as it was only 10 mins away. I washed and dried ALL my dirty clothes as I wanted to be presentable at my ward round and even repaired holes in my socks and repaired a pocket on my jeans. I returned to the ward before noon and was signed back in by one of the nurses. I then waited in my room for an hour assuming a nurse would call me for my ward round meeting with the ward psychiatrist. No meeting came and I then sat in front of the ward office for another hour expecting to be called to the ward round office, all the time suffering from tension and anxiety. I asked someone in the ward office, and was told my ward round was cancelled and rescheduled for a later date. No one who had seen me had had the decency to tell me at that it had been cancelled. I was left sitting there becoming ever more anxious and tense. As I was leaving the ward I spoke with a member of staff, and I told them how I had been treated during my stay. They seemed visibly disturbed about their colleagues behaviour! The whole time I was on the ward I felt like I was in a prison camp. My biggest worry as a tax payer is that my money is ill spent on this ward where the staff don't seem to know how their lack of understanding and their behaviour affects individuals. I feel that someone needs to look into how the ward is run. My whole experience on the ward was that it was not fit for purpose for someone with a mental health problem.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-03-24T22:05:18.1266667","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2022-04-01T11:03:28.147","readBy":[{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2022)","count":1},{"name":"Pennine Care NHS Foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/926389?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"926389"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/926389/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"926389"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/926389/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"926389"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/926389/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"926389"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rt2_710i?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"RT2_710i","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ignored?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"ignored"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unimportant?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Unimportant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/isolation?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"isolation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lack%20of%20understanding?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"lack of understanding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20illness?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"mental illness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attitude?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"staff attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/time%20wasted?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"time wasted"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%20restrictions?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"covid restrictions"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%2019?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"covid 19"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/repeated%20testing?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"repeated testing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20approachable?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"not approachable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20at%20ease?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"not at ease"}]},{"id":926606,"author":"Emmrd63","authorRoleId":10,"authorRole":"a volunteer/advocate","title":"Support","body":"Wow, Peter is so good at his work, thank you so much for being there and thank you so much for hearing me and advocating for me to have the depot reduced, you are a star.

Our hospital provides hot meals up to a certain time and then only sandwiches are available. After being admitted from ED, I was offered a sandwich even though l disclosed my allergies! (It’s all over my file also!). I was made to feel like a nuisance! This is a hospital! Should cater for all allergies. I asked for a menu so I could assess the ingredients myself, but was told no more hot cooked meals available and all they had was pre-made sandwiches! I asked whether there was any salad and I was presented with a very sad looking wilting leafy salad without any protein. I asked for fruit to fill me up a bit more as I was so hungry!  \r\nThis is not acceptable! How can a hospital have no form of protein and plain vegetables available? I would have been over the moon with a chicken breast or mince with some plain vegetables,but was told this isn’t available! Shocking! The next day, my partner brought me some tinned tuna and snacks I could have, as I was offered a hot meal the next day, but all in sauces thickened with ingredients I’m allergic to. Not a good experience when a hospital can’t provide simple meals to allergic patients. A hospital is a place to heal, and nutrition is important! A sandwich as the only option sure isn’t proper nutrition to heal.  \r\n[Unsure about 'Food']  \r\n  \r\n[Unsure about 'Staff attitude']  \r\n","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-04-01T11:04:03.65","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-04-01T13:08:07.283","readBy":[{"name":"Royal Cornwall Hospitals NHS Trust","count":10}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/928413?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"928413"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/928413/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"928413"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/928413/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"928413"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/928413/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"928413"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/ref12-sal?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"ref12-sal","score":4},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disappointed?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/shocked?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"shocked"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/allergic?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"allergic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hungry?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"hungry"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/meals?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"meals"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nutrition?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"nutrition"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/recording%20information?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"recording information"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reading%20notes?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"reading notes"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/food%20options?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"food options"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/allergy%20awareness?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"allergy awareness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/patient%20meals?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"patient meals"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/930609?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"930609"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/930644?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"930644"}]},{"id":928421,"author":"PolduPixie","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Friendly and reassuring","body":"I received my dermatology day case appointment for treatment just three weeks after being seen and assessed at clinic.

A thorough systemic review is needed I think.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-04-01T08:46:54","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-04-01T20:08:45","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/928476?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"928476"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/928476/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"928476"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/928476/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"928476"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/928476/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"928476"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/nvc14?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"NVC14","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/informed?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lapse?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"lapse"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/operation?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"operation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unhappy?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"unhappy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"covid"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%2019?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"covid 19"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/930384?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"930384"}]},{"id":928478,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Awful practice","body":"The receptionist staff are unhelpful and rude, and refuse to let you speak to management.

From the initial meeting when forms were completed and procedures explained, and options given, through to the transnasal examination (scope via my nose passage) I received exemplary service far exceeding my expectations. I must give special credit to the nurses for their calm and professional service and their reassuring manner which put me immediately at ease. Although the Endoscopist had a tight schedule for today's appointments he gave me detailed explanations of his procedures and diagnoses, with advice and comments. The complete procedure took approximately 15 minutes and was concluded by a personal copy of a comprehensive report which will be sent to my GP.
