He had been catheterised and this particular night fluid was not passing through to leg bag and pressure was building in his bladder. The nurse came into his room and realised they couldn’t offer him any help - as they explained they had an injury, but said they would go and get help and left the room. Meantime fluid was leaking from either side of catheter And the bed became wet as well as my husbands nightwear.  \r\nEventually someone else came in and my husband explained what was happening. This person (why I say person - my husband didn’t think this staff member was a nurse) but this person decided the answer was to fit a night bag to the leg bag. My husband assured him this would not work as problem appeared to be at catheter site and if it couldn’t drain into leg bag it definitely wouldn’t get to night bag. The staff member ignored my husband - who was becoming increasingly more distressed- and insisted this would work. My husband explained he was already lying wet and his whole situation would only get worse because this staff member was not tackling the problem and meanwhile the pressure was building and my husband was in pain. The member of staff said they would then have to get a doctor and my husband asked “now? The staff member said no in the morning. My husband explained he definitely couldn’t wait that long to which they replied well what am I supposed to do? and left my husband wet and in pain.  \r\nThese are the only two people on duty and it is fair to say one physically couldn’t help and the other hadn’t a clue and/or didn’t care less.  \r\nThere is a duty of care to patients which was most certainly lacking that night. The very worrying concern is potentially patients lives were put at risk that night.  \r\nOur Government should be absolutely ashamed they have not carried out their promises to NHS. I understand if staff strike it is potentially putting patients lives at risk but believe me it is only when you see the struggle of the staff first hand, patients in hospital are potentially more at risk than one or two days of an all out strike.  \r\n","criticality":"strongly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-03-11T12:15:26.0166667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-03-21T09:30:00.61","readBy":[{"name":"South Eastern Health and Social Care Trust","count":6},{"name":"Public Health Agency","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/923057?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"923057"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/923057/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"923057"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/923057/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"923057"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/923057/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"923057"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt004_07021?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"ZT004_07021","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20listened%20to?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"not listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/catheterised?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"catheterised"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/distressed?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"distressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/left%20in%20pain?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"left in pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/some%20staff%20attitude?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"some staff attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/most%20of%20the%20nursing%20staff?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"most of the nursing staff"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/925526?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"925526"}]},{"id":925274,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Brilliant Care ","body":"All the staff at the practice have been brilliant with me contacting the surgery recently with my care quite a number of times as I have been quite unwell, always feel like I've been dealt with properly.

This was obviously extremely distressing for both him and his family. I do understand that we may still have to have some restrictions when allowing visitors due to COVID but the procedures they have in place here feel counter-productive.  \r\nHaving visitors held in the entrance hall to perform LFT tests prior to visiting seems wrong. Surely the sensible thing to do is for the visitor to test before you leave home... if a person was to test positive in this area you have potentially just infected the other people waiting there too?  \r\nYou have a central phone number to book the appointment which is busy and sometimes doesn’t get answered for a while. Going from one central place to book in for your appointment to then have to walk across the hospital site to the ward you are visiting is encouraging people moving around the hospital unnecessarily.  \r\nI know other hospitals do not have this procedure for visitors. Booking an appointment directly with the ward, encouraging LFT before going to the hospital and wearing masks whilst visiting feel like appropriate measures and ones that have been adopted in other trusts.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-03-18T10:21:12.7433333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-03-21T11:58:57.907","readBy":[{"name":"Tameside and Glossop Integrated Care NHS Foundation Trust","count":1},{"name":"Healthwatch Tameside","count":2},{"name":"The Stroke Association","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/924757?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"924757"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/924757/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"924757"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/924757/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"924757"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/924757/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"924757"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rmp01_300?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"RMP01_300","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/infection%20risk?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"infection risk"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stroke?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"stroke"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/visiting?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"visiting"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%20testing?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"covid testing"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/925635?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"925635"}]},{"id":925288,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Very reassuring ","body":"One of the paramedics came out to visit an elderly lady who suffers from dementia.

My waters broke again and I was admitted to the ward at Ninewells due to gestational diabetes and previous precipitate labour. With my first I had no pain relief because of the care and speed of my labour, apart from gas & air in the labour suite. I was adamant I wanted pain relief this time and surely I’d be able to get it as they had prior warning of my fast labour?  \r\nApparently not, as my baby decided he was coming at shift handover time. I laboured on the ward (again) in extreme agony (back to back) asking to go down to labour suite and was told I had to wait for shift handover. I got gas & air in the ward which did nothing for me. My labour was fast again, I was rushed to labour suite on a bed (again) told I was fully dilated and had no pain relief.  \r\nTwo poor experiences of birth at Ninewells.

The general cleanliness of the ward is spot on and the food is also great with a wide variety of options for each meal. Overall most things have been of a great standard.","criticality":"minimally critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-03-19T15:36:46.3433333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-03-21T13:54:39.99","readBy":[{"name":"Southern Health and Social Care Trust","count":4}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/924998?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"924998"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/924998/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"924998"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/924998/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"924998"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/924998/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"924998"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_32024_110?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"ZT003_32024_110","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/caring?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"caring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cleanliness?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"cleanliness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly%20staff?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"friendly staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20consistency?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"staff consistency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting%20times?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"waiting times"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20for?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wonderful?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"wonderful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/food%20quality?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"food quality"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/food%20variety?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"food variety"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/925507?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"925507"}]},{"id":925003,"author":"Fmcgr21","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Inpatient stay for my son","body":"As a mother of a 31 yr old son with mild learning difficulties , trying to get information from staff in ED was terrible.  \r\nOnce we were transferred to ward 7b the care could not have been better and the staff have been wonderful.

During this time I underwent 4 x IVFs. I was in my early forties with reasonable AMH and no fertility issues other than age. I had a previous pregnancy a few years earlier with no issues. I was undergoing fertility treatment due to male factor infertility issues.  \r\nI feel that the treatment I received as a patient was not individualised at ACS at all. I was put on a treatment protocol for females with low AMH; prescribed the highest dose of fertility meds at a high cost physically/mentally/financially.  \r\nDuring IVF treatment I felt that I was not coping with the high dose of ovarian stimulation meds physically and mentally (Abdo pain / night sweats / headaches / mood swings) and often explained to the nurse that it seemed that it was too much ovulation stimulation and should be reduced. I was always told that because of my age I should be on max dose of fertility stimulation drugs and this would give me the best chance of success.  \r\nI feel that ACS pushed me to have maximum drugs to try and get an increased quantity of eggs harvested. I feel my concerns that I was on too much medication were not listened to and that I was just a number. I do not feel that the treatment was personalised in any way. I enquired about reducing the fertility meds and opting for a more natural cycle however I was advised that this would reduce any chance of pregnancy.  \r\nAfter 4 failed cycles at ACS and not being listened to I changed to another private clinic. The doctor at the new clinic agreed that I had been put on far too high a dose of ovarian stimulation meds and agreed that this would really not have been good for my body and would likely have impacted negatively on egg quality. At the new clinic I had another two cycles using less than half the amount of ovarian stimulation meds which yielded similar amounts of eggs. It was a breeze at the new clinic in comparison to the treatment at Glasgow ACS.  \r\nUnfortunately I did not get pregnant at the new clinic however I wish I had not wasted 2 years in my early forties doing IVF at ACS. I feel I was over -medicated with ovarian stimulation and the treatment protocol was not personalised. In my experience ACS do not personalise treatment and push maximum ovarian stimulation in an attempt to try and get as much eggs as possible. This is a trying process mentally and physically and one which requires scrutiny.  \r\nI also had a lot of issues with the administration side of things around consents and blood tests etc. There was always some issue. As well as that I found ACS very inflexible re appointment times.  \r\nI wanted to record my concerns publicly about ACS as it would be interesting to establish whether other females have had similar issues concerning being over-medicated with ovarian stimulation and this impacting on them negatively.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-03-17T21:32:10.0166667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-03-21T15:02:05.29","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":7},{"name":"Fertility Network Scotland","count":1},{"name":"Ulster University, MBBS (Medicine) 2021","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/924626?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"924626"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/924626/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"924626"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/924626/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"924626"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/924626/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"924626"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/g107h-assisted-conception?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"G107H-assisted-conception","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/angry?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"angry"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20being%20listened%20to?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"not being listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sad?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"sad"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/administration?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"administration"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appointment%20times?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Appointment times"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fertility?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Fertility"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/individual%20care?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"individual care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ivf?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"IVF"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ovulation?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"ovulation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/regret?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"regret"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ovarian%20stimulation?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"ovarian stimulation"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/925602?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"925602"}]},{"id":924999,"author":"Decde74","authorRoleId":8,"authorRole":"a staff member posting for a patient/service user","title":"The staff have all been lovely","body":"I came to Craigavon Hospital 8 days ago with a fractured foot.

He left the hospital with a lot of medication to take. This is the first prescription he needed and found 1 medication was not on the prescription so with a lot of effort made a visit to the doctors surgery to explain the mistake and ask for help. The receptionist was actually very helpful and said they would sort it and he could collect the medication the next day. The next day he was not very well so I went to collect the medication. The missing tablets were still not on the prescription so I went back to the reception. The first person I saw said the doctor had not ticked a box we all make mistakes nobody is perfect but then another staff member interrupted who was so unhelpful rude and showed no empathy, just kept repeating it was my sons fault, and that 48 hours were needed for medication. They did not ask any questions or try to help and the tone of voice was very condescending. I left in tears and really feel disappointed with my experience, this has been my doctors for many years.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-03-16T22:44:43.5366667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-03-21T15:20:00.243","readBy":[],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/924370?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"924370"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/924370/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"924370"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/924370/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"924370"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/924370/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"924370"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/h85063?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"H85063","score":1},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disappointed?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/brain%20injury?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"brain injury"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/condescending?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"condescending"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/empathy?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"empathy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/prescriptions?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"prescriptions"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/some%20staff?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"some staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attitude?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"staff attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unhelpful?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"unhelpful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/administrative%20errors?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"administrative errors"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/933766?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"933766"}]},{"id":925031,"author":"Aquarius21x","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"My knee","body":"The staff member did checks and gave me exercises to do to help my knee.

In the meantime My mum had phoned my brother saying she was being discharged. He picked her up from a reception area where she was sitting alone, no information provided other than a prescription for antibiotics. I realise the system is under pressure but to leave an exhausted elderly person unattended in an empty waiting room to make the call asking for a lift home at 4am after admission with a fall is not acceptable. She is self-caring, independent normally - but cannot remember as she is so tired what happened and what was said - and is in a lot of pain this morning. As family members we need information to continue care at home so as not to have to constantly refer to an overstretched system. What bloods were done? She was anaemic last week… cause still to be determined. Was she x rayed? Could she have a rib or vertebra fracture? This information is crucial to our ongoing care and re mobilization at home.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-03-18T08:15:57.4933333","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2022-03-21T16:48:28.743","readBy":[{"name":"Healthwatch North Yorkshire","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/924710?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"924710"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/924710/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"924710"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/924710/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"924710"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/924710/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"924710"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rcd01_180?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"RCD01_180","score":1},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confused?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"confused"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anaemic?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"anaemic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/antibiotics?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"antibiotics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/chest%20pain?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"chest pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/concerned?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"concerned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/discharge%20at%20night?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"discharge at night"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fall?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"fall"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/information?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"information"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/osteoporosis?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"osteoporosis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/oxygen?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"oxygen"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/shoulder?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"shoulder"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/conflicting%20information?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"conflicting information"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/misinformation?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"misinformation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/family%20not%20kept%20informed?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"family not kept informed"}]},{"id":924818,"author":"Chatham resident","authorRoleId":4,"authorRole":"a relative","title":"Queuing outside before visiting","body":"This is a follow up to my previous story about my wife being made to wait outside A&E at 4am in the morning whilst her mother with mixed dementia was taken in alone.  \r\nHer mother was later admitted to the hospital and the next day when my wife went to visit on a booked visiting slot, she and many others were made to queue outside in the rain and despite protesting and asking if they could go inside to get warm and get a cuppa in the cafe they were told in an abrupt and unfriendly manner by one of the women directing the queue that no they could not and they wouldn't be allowed in until they said so!
