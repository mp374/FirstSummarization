I was first in the queue (even though it took ages for them to answer!) and was told there would be no triage, just appts. Happy with this, I explained my issue. The receptionist took down details and offered an appt at another surgery. I explained that I couldn’t make that time, as I had another appt elsewhere, could I get an afternoon one. Was told basically no, the system doesn’t allow future appts for later in the day, it’s first come first served on the system, so I either take it or don’t see a doctor.  \r\nHonestly, I think this kind of service is just horrific. In my view, this surgery is beyond incompetent now - they have no patient care anymore, the phone system is awful and long winded, you are lucky if you get a receptionist who will actually listen, and the triage system is a joke.  \r\nIn my opinion, the owner, shareholders & GPs at this surgery need to take a long hard look at the feedback they are receiving and do the right thing.

I was already waiting for an x ray of my foot which was requested by my doctor earlier in the week . \n\nDuring the week the pain had become more severe and was waking me at night. I could not stand for any length of time and only limp  which was affecting my employment and daily routine. I had read that the problem I was experiencing  should be addressed to avoid further damage and possible permanent deformity. I therefore thought it was reasonable to attend a and e at Eastbourne.\n\nI booked in an ipad and began waiting. The display informed patients that there was a seven hour wait to see a doctor. There were few seats with many patients standing waiting.\n\nAfter a short wait I was called into triage and told that as i was under my gp there was nothing that they would do for me and I was to wait until the x ray appointment came through.\n\nNo matter how much I explained that the pain had worsened The nurse was adamant that I could not be seen and must ask my doctor for stronger pain killers.\n\nThe nurse told me that there was an aging population in the country and due to this, care was limited. I am of the aging population who has paid my contributions for forty five years. I resented this excuse.\n\nMy foot was not even examined due to the fact that I hadn't had an accident or trauma. Therefore the bone sticking out at the side of my foot and the bruise were never observed.\n\nI explained that I believed that it was a stress fracture from long standing foot issues however his was totally dismissed.\n\nWhen I do receive an x ray and  follow up with the m s k department and discover that perhaps further unnecessary injury has occurred or possible deformity I will consider making a formal complaint.\n","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-12-02T15:43:24","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2022-12-05T10:21:13","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1004380?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1004380"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1004380/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1004380"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1004380/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1004380"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1004380/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1004380"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rxc02?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"RXC02","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stress?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"stress"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/believed?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"believed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bone?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"bone"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dismissed?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"dismissed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/foot?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"foot"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fracture?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"fracture"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/in%20pain?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"in pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/informed?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/injury?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"injury"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20believed?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"not believed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/severe%20pain?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"severe pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stronger?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"stronger"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/triage?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"triage"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/x%20ray?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"x ray"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/x-ray?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"X-ray"}]},{"id":1004379,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Dissatisfaction with doctors ","body":"My daughter has been suffering from severe abdominal pains.

As soon as I met the breast surgery team I felt confident that I was in capable hands. The plan of care was explained clearly and my tests were carried out quickly and efficiently.  The operation was booked in reasonable time and it was a relief to get it over with no hold ups. Everyone I met was kind and professional - the fantastic surgeon( Miss Ives), the nurses, and the radiologist.  After 6 weeks I am fully recovered with barely any sign of the surgery. I still have radiotherapy to look forward to but I am very grateful to all who have helped me so far.

The nurse got better but there just seemed no system throughout for flagging up his needs.  \r\nIt all went on into the evening with us waiting and after 6 hours there were more bloods and chest X rays but no results  \r\nThe doctor came in finally after 7 hours - we were in blood room to wait because there was nowhere else by that time. They were splayed out in chair and apologized saying sorry but they were so tired - long shift after a long shift. We were surprised at this behaviour. They then said -so you are blind and asked my husband to guess what colour he was. My husband was taken aback and made a guess. They then went on to say that my husband needed a nebulizer and more meds so needed to stay in to see med team in the morning and have a ct scan.  \r\nHe was then left on a trolley to sleep on in a corridor and next to cupboard with no covering. The only loo was at far end of corridor, and he did need the toilet several times in the night which of course was very challenging for him.  \r\nI had left as it was half midnight but my husband could not easily get to toilet. He can see some vague shapes so pushed button to go back in reception went past there to the loos and had to be let back in. The receptionist got bolshy second time around which was very demeaning for my husband. Next time he had to explain that he couldn't see which was very demeaning again no information passed on about him. He had a covid test at 4:30 and then some steroids which made him start to hallucinate. Despite calling for nurses who would occasionally come to him say they would do something and then not return. No attention from staff then till 9:00 the next morning.  \r\nThe next morning, he had more steroids which sent him over edge. They made his blindness worse, and he could not bear the bright lights and was hallucinating.  \r\nWhen the day shift started my husband was by this time very distressed with the overall lack of care and the medication given him and begged me to take him home and told a nurse.  \r\nThe nurse told another doctor who asked him to sign discharge form. He asked the doctor who had an accent he could not understand, what he wanted him to say. The doctor then got him to sign the form but had to keep saying bit higher as he got him to sign in the right place.  \r\nI then found him at the edge of car park. He was complaining of flashing lights, he was cold and in a right state.  \r\nWe are very distressed about the care he experienced and being let out of the hospital like that. There seemed no system for communicating his needs.  \r\nThe Dr suggested that he would be fine sleeping on trolley because he was hard of hearing and blind which was really inappropriate and insensitive.  \r\nEven after all this there have been no notes sent to our own doctor. Other examples of care included sputum samples that were never looked at and the nurse could not find the phials of medicine to go into the nebulizer. There was no attention paid to the hallucinations caused by the steroids. He was never written up for CT scan which he was told he needed.  \r\nWe would really like the hospital to be aware of this distressing experience so have shared our feedback. My husband has given consent for this to be shared.","criticality":"strongly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-11-29T15:20:28.7","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-12-05T12:09:54.557","readBy":[{"name":"Ulster University, MBBS (Medicine) 2021","count":5},{"name":"Western Health and Social Care Trust","count":8}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1002446?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1002446"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1002446/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1002446"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1002446/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1002446"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1002446/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1002446"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/swah-ed?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"swah-ed","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lack%20of%20care?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Lack of care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/a&e?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"a&e"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blindness?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"blindness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20tests?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"blood tests"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/busy%20ward?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"busy ward"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ct%20scan?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"CT scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/distressed?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"distressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/facilities?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"facilities"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/flashing%20lights?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"flashing lights"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hearing?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"hearing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/high%20blood%20pressure?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"high blood pressure"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lack%20of%20understanding?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"lack of understanding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/poor%20discharge%20arrangements?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"poor discharge arrangements"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attitude?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"staff attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/x%20ray?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"x ray"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassion?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"compassion"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/shortness%20of%20breath?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"shortness of breath"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1004429?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1004429"}]},{"id":1004427,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"A good practice","body":"Turned up for my flu jab on a Saturday morning.

My community midwife was first-rate; supportive and positive about my home birth and determined to help me realise my birth wishes. Sadly she was not on call when i went into labour, so i didnt know the community midwives who attended my birth. They were nice ladies but as i hadnt met them, i was very glad to have my doula with me to ensure my birth plan wishes where followed.  \r\nThe biggest problem with the service was that the midwives on call during the night (when most births happen) had been on shift all day, so when my birth was expected to last till 9/10am, they became increasingly unable to stay to facilitate a home birth. Consequently, i felt slightly pressured into transferring to hospital in the early hours.  \r\nWhen i arrived at hospital, again i was eternally grateful for my doula interceding on my behalf. Despite my birth progressing better, the hospital maternity team were pressuring for interventions to speed things up. I agreed to continuous monitoring for a short period of time to ensure that all was well and despite there being no cause for concern, some staff were then reluctant to allow me to stop the monitoring and actively tried to go against my wishes and not let me use the birth pool when it became available. Without my partner and doula fighting on my behalf, i felt some staff would have been happy to refuse my requests when there was no good reason to do so, and were too quick to insist on interventions that were not necessary.  \r\nI was also disappointed to find that there were no birthing balls, or floor mats available to use in the delivery suite and i was expected to remain on a bed during labour.  \r\nWith my partner and doula interceding on my behalf, senior staff reluctantly let me use the birth pool and allowed my birth to progress at its own pace and as a result i enjoyed a natural delivery with gas and air and no other interventions.  \r\nThe midwife who attended my birth in the hospital was also first-rate, she was supportive and calm, and had a level of trust in my capacity to have a natural birth that other staff lacked. I felt she was on my side, and supported me to make informed decisions about my care. As did the senior consultant who carried out my last scan.  \r\nThere was a total mix in the attitude of the consultants and other hospital staff during my pregnancy and birth. Some were wonderful, supportive and left me feeling empowered and supported in my care decisions. And others left me feeling overridden and disempowered, including. Examples of phrases that I feel should be avoided are things like \"we won't let you...\" \"we don't let ...\" \"you can't ... \" and references to things being \"policy\".  \r\nThat said, i would like to thank the majority of those involved with my care for their support and dedication through my pregnancy and birth. Your care and consideration was very much appreciated and made my overall experience a positive one.  \r\nIt would be great if funds could be found to make large birthing balls and floor mats available in the labour suite to facilitate more natural birthing positions and give expectant mums more freedom of movement during labour.  \r\nIt is also unrealisitic to expect midwifes to support home births when on shift during the day and then on call overnight.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-12-02T16:53:35.9766667","progress":"Story has a

She was very pleasant and observed Saba then she took over and followed Saba's instructions carefully.  \r\nThe procedure was quick painless and I was well looked after by the team. This is a much needed service for people like me who have suffered severe incontinence for years in relation to an overactive bladder. It's awful living with the condition and the impact it has on my life and I rely on the hope of a period of relief given as a result of the Botox. I have been getting them for 15 years.

Not sure if it's a NHS funding issue or terrible management but something isn't working. For the third time in 2 weeks I can't even get into the 8am phone queue to try book an emergency appointment today. Despite calling every 5-30 seconds for 15 mins, all I get is the busy tone. When I raised this with the receptionist last week I was told they have no idea why that's happening, rather than they'll look into it.\n\nWhen you do finally get onto a receptionist, you get to learn the earliest appointment is in 6 weeks and you don't get any time allocation, you just have to keep a whole day free for a doctor's call. Great for those with full time work. Furthermore, I was advised you can only discuss one health issue with your doctor per appointment, which would make sense if you can get appointments easily but borders on absurd given you have to wait 6 weeks and they'll only book one appointment at a time. As someone with multiple chronic health problems that require active management to avoid long stints of work/hospital admissions, it is a complete failure of patient care.\n\nFinally, when you go into the clinic the receptionists leave you waiting for at least 5 minutes without ever acknowledging your presence.

Chloe was there most of the time and was such a breath of fresh air. She knew when to chat and when I needed a bit of quiet. She was so friendly and nothing was a hassle for her.  \r\nChloe explained everything she was doing, even though she knew I had done it before.  \r\nI felt in very good hands, even better after finding out she had not long qualified and was trained with my community midwife team.  \r\nChloe made me aware of my pain relief options, showed me how to use the gas and air properly and waited until I asked for morphine. We had to call her back in the room, along with Kirsteen, as baby didn't want to wait for morphine.  \r\nI delivered with lots of positive encouragement from both ladies, reassuring me the whole way through.  \r\nI agreed to let Chloe do my stitches, having not done many before. I made both ladies aware of the pain I experienced with stitches previously and they made sure I couldn't feel it this time. The whole time, they were talking and laughing with me, talking to dad and commenting on noises that our little baby was making.  \r\nChloe also supported me with breastfeeding for the first time. She didn't assume that I knew what or how to do it as I had other children. She was extremely patient and explained everything, making sure I understood each step. She then left us to feed and bond with our baby, with instructions to call her for anything at all - she even popped in several times after the birth to offer food and drinks to myself and my partner.  \r\nI really couldn't have asked for a more supportive or friendly pair of midwives. For Chloe to be so new to this, but so good, tells me she is already and will continue to be an excellent midwife.  \r\nThank you so much for everything. My baby and I went home that night and she has settled in really well with her big sisters 🥰","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-12-02T02:30:40.9066667","progress":"Story has a

The maternity team in Oban hospital were all brilliant. Kirsty was our main midwife and her help, advice and support she gave us was so appreciated and she was so friendly and made us feel super comfortable and relaxed the entire process. The rest of the team that we dealt with were also all so lovely and knowledgeable. (Rosie, Eva, Sheila, Hannah)  \r\nI ended up with cholestatis of pregnancy, and spoke to Rosie initially via phone when I had the symptoms. Rosie was super reassuring and Hannah came out straight away to take bloods to be tested, and when the diagnosis came back, Rosie and Kirsty both spoke me through the condition and made me feel really at ease. When it came to the fact I needed an induction, Kirsty was with me the entire way even though I'd be down in RAH in Paisley for the birth. She explained the entire induction process and was available on the phone & via text when I had any questions and with advice.  \r\nThe induction at RAH went really well. All the midwives were really attentive and made us feel really at ease. This was something I was worried about - not knowing any of the midwives for the induction & birth but I didn't need to worry as they all made me feel comfortable. We felt for the midwives in RAH as they were extremely busy with the amount of us on the ward to the amount of staff on at any one time. Despite this, I felt they were still very attentive and were all working really hard the entire time.  \r\nWe were also really impressed with the aftercare, the Oban midwife team were really helpful and supportive after babies arrival, and I felt the home visits were really useful as we had mountains of questions as first time parents and these were all answered in great detail by Kirsty, Sheila and Eva. We also had a bit of worry as he dropped slightly more weight than he should have but we were given so much support and help with this and he soon put the weight back on.  \r\nOverall a huge thanks to the teams in Oban and RAH.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-12-02T11:01:25.99","progress":"Story has a

She started me on Vestibular rehabilitation exercises and lots of good advice on handling the problem.
