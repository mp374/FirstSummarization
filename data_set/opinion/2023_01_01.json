The only thing I would change would be the length of my stay😂.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-12-31T20:59:32.44","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-01-01T11:46:58.927","readBy":[{"name":"Southern Health and Social Care Trust","count":3}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1013209?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1013209"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1013209/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1013209"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1013209/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1013209"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1013209/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1013209"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_32022-w2?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"zt003_32022-w2","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/best?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"best"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fantastic%20care?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"fantastic care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/food?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"food"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thankful?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Thankful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/great%20team?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"great team"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/virtual%20visiting?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"virtual visiting"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1013504?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1013504"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1016572?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1016572"}]},{"id":1013210,"author":"Niamhh1","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Not much too complain about- good care!","body":"The staff on Ward 1 are lovely, great great nurses.  \r\nThe food is okay, it fills a hole.  \r\nIt is a great hospital and everyone is very friendly.

The auxiliary/ care assistant had kindly made me a cup of tea too and checked to make sure that both me and my sister were okay.  \r\nI was also able to speak to the doctor that morning with no questions asked where he was able to explain the diagnosis in more detail. And again, thank you for taking your time to do that as I know you had to be called in to speak to me specifically.  \r\nThank you ward C31.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-01-01T00:46:10.44","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-01-01T17:11:39.503","readBy":[{"name":"South Tyneside and Sunderland NHS Foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1013212?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1013212"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1013212/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1013212"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1013212/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1013212"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1013212/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1013212"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/r0b01?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"R0B01","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/attentive?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"attentive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/auxiliary%20staff?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"auxiliary staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/comforted?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"comforted"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diagnosis?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"diagnosis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/explanation?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"explanation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/passed%20away?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"passed away"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pleasant%20staff?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"pleasant staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professional?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"professional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thoughtful?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"thoughtful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/calm?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"calm"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thankful?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Thankful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/big%20thank%20you?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"big thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kind%20nurse?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"kind nurse"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1014334?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1014334"}]},{"id":1013268,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"If only all Care homes were as good as this one","body":"Could not have wished for better.

The department was the busiest that I had ever seen, with the waiting room full and many people queuing down the corridor outside Radiology, others were sitting on the floor or were standing. Waiting time was 5-hours. Regardless of these pressures the reception, nursing, and Doctor team were exceptional and maintained their composure, and professionally moved us through the system. We were warned that A&E would close at 10pm (we arrived at 5.20pm) and therefore potential that we may not be seen that evening. Instead, staff from wards were reassigned to manage the A&E and we were eventually seen at 3.30am. We left at around 4am where a small handful of people remained to be seen in the waiting room. \nI do believe that a town the size of Cheltenham is worthy of an overnight A&E department, so I am grateful to your teams who went the extra mile to bridge this gap on 27th December.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-12-29T19:10:13","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-01-01T20:43:22","readBy":[{"name":"Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1013269?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1013269"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1013269/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1013269"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1013269/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1013269"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1013269/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1013269"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rte01?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"RTE01","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/radiology?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"radiology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20grateful?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"very grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thanks?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"thanks"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/like%20myself?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"like myself"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1018273?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1018273"}]},{"id":1013272,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Telephone consultation ","body":"Excellent service.

To avoid a hospital visit via ambulance especially at this time, we asked for either antibiotics she has had before or an appointment. Anyone who has an elderley relative knows how this can escalate. Told by the receptionist that we need to either call 111 or the out of hours after 6.30pm as there are no appointments available. How was my mum assessed? By someone who had no medical training whatsoever! We know the signs and as they are now not open till Weds, we have to hope she does not deteriorate. She suffers from a multitude of heart and kidney conditions. No wonder A&E are on their knees, GPs need to not allocate responsibility to assess a patient to someone untrained, something which a few seem to relish. Very upset as a quick assessment now could mean the difference between staying in her own home or attending hospital via ambulance.

down the worst GP in London","body":"It hasn’t been possible to get an appointment here since about 10 years ago. It’s a rat race for an “emergency appointment” you have to call at 8am on the dot to request a same day urgent appointment. That’s the only option you have. And they don’t even answer the phone. If they do answer, they’re always rude and dismissive. If you’re on hold until 8.05am, high chance there are no appointments left. You’re not allowed to discuss more than one issue at an appointment. Doctors aren’t there to listen to patients either. Extremely dismissive and frankly useless. The all read from the same script “what do you want me to do about it?” Followed by “we can’t offer you that” It’s a waste of time going in if you ever get an appointment. You’re better off going straight into a&e or self diagnosing online. Referrals are £25. And you have to pay for doctors notes. Every single time I have a health problem, I think of my gp and realise there’s no point looking for help so I let things get worse or escalate. This has been the case for as long as I can remember and I can’t help but feel like if I had a better GP a lot of health issues could have been avoided.

I suffer with chronic asthma and was suffering wit burning chest pains and wheezing. I was worrying I had pneumonia so I took my self down. There was only about 5 people in the waiting room but waiting two hours with bad breathing. I then got take in by what I assume is a triage nurse or something. I cannot explain how rude she was and made me feel so sad and uncomfortable. The second she came in she said take ur jacket off so I did and just put it in the bed. She then said in a rude manner why have you just done that that’s a clean sanitised bed whilst sighing at me clearly frustrated. I said I’m sorry I didn’t mean to and didn’t know. She then went on to say there was nothing wrong with me and I’m in the Same boat as everyone else as shouldn’t have come to a&e. I told her that I have been hospitalised numerous times with my asthma and it’s not a joke I have to get to a hospital asap or if it’s bad my lips turn blue. She made me feel like I didn’t matter at all. I didn’t feel like she looked after my properly and I felt very uncomfortable. So then the next nurse came in she was more polite but said she couldn’t hear a wheeze in my chest and said she was only goin to give me steroids and no antibiotics. They sent me home. And since I’ve been back I’ve deteriated massively my chest is wheezing louder than ever I can barely breath. I have suffered my whole life with asthma I know my condition and to be made to feel yesterday like there was nothing wrong me and they were making me feel like I was wasting their time. I’m not going to lie but pretty disgusted. Worst way I’ve ever been treated at a hospital. If I go in to any other a&e they rush me straight in because it’s asthma. But they really weren’t bothered about me. I won’t ever be recommending this place to anyone. I understand the nhs is struggling at the moment but you do not need to be rude to patients.

Patients don’t want to come out in the cold maybe an idea would be that you should update your website with this important information for us as sick patients can try other means to get the help that we need.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2023-01-01T09:18:39","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2023-01-01T22:04:37","readBy":[{"name":"Mid and South Essex NHS Foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1013295?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1013295"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1013295/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1013295"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1013295/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1013295"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1013295/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1013295"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/raj1u?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"RAJ1U","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"medication"}]},{"id":1013293,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Good Practice ","body":"My recent prostate PSA results came back really high\nThe Doctor immediately organised a second blood test and a flow test at Kettering Hospital I was most impressed \nThankfully the second blood test came back satisfactory ","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2023-01-01T09:22:07","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2023-01-01T22:06:47","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1013293?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1013293"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1013293/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1013293"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1013293/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1013293"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1013293/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1013293"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/k83002?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"K83002","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"blood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20test?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"blood test"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20impressed?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"not impressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/prostate?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"prostate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/psa?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"PSA"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/test?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"test"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/impressed?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"impressed"}]},{"id":1013299,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Great practice","body":"My experience was excellent.

Only after I complained they came up with false allegations about me, defamatory in nature which I believe amounts to a form of victimisation, and which according to the hospital's own records, copies of which I have in my possession, are completely untrue.  \r\nThey did the usual NHS trick of passing it to the ombudsman. That is a waste of time because the ombudsman service only rarely finds for the complainant (just look at the statistics, out of 27885 complaints received 2021/2022 only 63 fully upheld (0.23%) and 307 (1.1%) partly upheld. I am still waiting for the ombudsman to come back to me with an outcome as they have only recently contacted me (when it was at least 9 months since I referred the matter to them).  \r\nDue to the member of staff who made the untrue statements (who I reported to the HCPC), I can no longer attend that hospital at all since I have no witness to attend with me now, and I do not trust them to be honest or treat me properly.

It can months before you get any answers, which is not acceptable.  \r\nWe feel there is an arrogance the way this surgery conducts itself  \r\n.Patients should always come first","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-12-29T14:04:57.2433333","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2023-01-02T09:20:01.99","readBy":[],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1012472?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1012472"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1012472/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1012472"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1012472/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1012472"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1012472/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1012472"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/k81002?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"K81002","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/arrogance?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"arrogance"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appointments?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"appointments"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/booking%20system?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"booking system"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gp%20surgery?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"GP surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/rudeness?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"rudeness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unhelpful?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"unhelpful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting%20times?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"waiting times"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/answer%20complaint?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"answer complaint"}]},{"id":1012556,"author":"Jamb22","authorRoleId":4,"authorRole":"a relative","title":"My Dads stay in CICU","body":"My dad was transferred from Derby to Trent Cardiac Centre at the beginning of November.

I wanted to bring the following to your attention not only because of the potential damage that has been done to my partner's long-term health but also the almost ludicrous financial implications of this for a cash strapped NHS.  \r\nMy partner had a stroke caused by a bleed on the brain at the beginning of December 2022. She was taken to the John Radcliffe acute stroke unit where she has been ever since. She was declared medically fit to move to rehab 4 days later. The John Radcliffe managed to arrange for her to have a bed at the Leamington Spa Rehab Hospital.  \r\nThe problem has then arisen because University Hospital Coventry have intervened and have said that she cannot enter rehab until she has been assessed at the hospital in Coventry, despite having the JR assessments. It is only after this that she can be moved to Leamington. Since then numerous contacts have been made by the John Radcliffe to Coventry and in addition I have made calls myself. The response has been that they will not make a bed available because they are not accepting any cross county transfers. They are unable to advise when this might change and therefore she remains in limbo.  \r\nAs you appreciate the recovery from a stroke is largely dependent on the sort of rehab that you receive early on. As she has been blocked from receiving this care by, for how long who knows , she is unable to move forward. My partner is in her early 60s she is very fit and fortunately her cognition is largely undamaged. She is also a very determined goals based person that would benefit enormously from the right sort of care. As you can see from the above this treatment of her by the Warwickshire Health Authority is difficult to comprehend on any level. Aside from a number of NHS protocols that are being broken treatment wise. There is also the wider implications of having an acute bed blocked at the John Radcliffe at whatever that might cost per day. An unnecessary ambulance journey, an acute bed blocked Coventry hospital and the resulting delays in the treatment she needs urgently.  \r\nMy partner as I have said is by nature a strong determined woman but this lack of progress is severely damaging her mental well-being. She has moved from having a positive attitude into a very dark place. This too cannot be an acceptable way of treating someone who has already had a life disruption of this nature.  \r\nI hope you don’t mind me contacting via this medium but I thought you should be aware of what appears to be an inflexible attitude and also because as you will appreciate I am very concerned about my partners future, both medical and mentally, if this impasse continues.  \r\nI look forward to hearing from you.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-12-30T15:39:38.3466667","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2023-01-02T09:20:02.317","readBy":[{"name":"Ulster University, MBBS (Medicine) 2021","count":1},{"name":"The Stroke Association","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1012937?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1012937"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1012937/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1012937"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1012937/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1012937"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1012937/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1012937"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rjc46?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"RJC46","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rkb01_314?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"RKB01_314","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rth08_300?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"RTH08_300","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/access?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"access"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bleed?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"bleed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/extremely%20frustrated?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"extremely frustrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/rehab?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"rehab"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stroke?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"stroke"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/access%20to%20bed?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"access to bed"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1013331?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1013331"}]},{"id":1012986,"author":"AliC","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"GP and misinformation","body":"I was an inpatient at Wishaw General.

I explained to my GP how anxious I was and that it being Christmas and new year, I can't relax to enjoy it with my children waiting on these results. My GP informed me there was no biopsy done, they were reading a very in-depth letter from the gynaecology dept and there's no mention of a biopsy being done.  \r\nToday I received a letter with an appt to go discuss the results of my recent biopsy. I called to complain to the GP practice and was told by office staff that yes they could in fact see that they were noted about the biopsy and that the hospital have said on the letter that they will contact me direct with results and a copy of the letter will be sent to my GP.  \r\nI said I'd like to complain as the GP told me I was worrying over nothing and no biopsy had ever been taken. They advised me that even though they'd seen it on the letter, it was in the small print and the GP had maybe missed it.  \r\nI'm horrified tbh. I understand that mistakes can happen and the hospital have contacted me anyway, but they actually made me feel like I was going mad and worrying over nothing.

She has had several falls over the past 12 months and is very unsteady on her feet. She also has regular infections which have led to sepsis 8 times.  \r\nWhilst on the Oakham Ward at this hospital she has been very unwell, has not received physio as promised, and is now being released home. My mum has been on the phone daily to try and ensure she is placed in a care home for a small amount of time to allow her to recover and hopefully regain some of her mobility to allow her to go back home.  \r\nShe was told that she had a place at a local care home, only for that to be cancelled and told they're sending her home with 2 carers a day. That is 23 hours a day she will be left alone, with the nearest family member a 40-minute drive away. She is unable to dress herself, cook for herself, take herself to the bathroom or complete any normal day-to-day tasks.  \r\nThe duty of care provided has been horrific, this is an accident waiting to happen. She has worked her entire life, paid into the system, and all the hospital are interested in is getting rid of her to free space for another patient to come in. The lack of understanding and remorse has been horrific, and when an accident does happen and she is seriously injured or worse, no one will be there to take liability.  \r\nIt may be nothing to the healthcare workers, but she is everything to us - the NHS need to sort their priorities out and improve care for those who have contributed for their entire existence.

I am 9 weeks pregnant, my third pregnancy past 6 weeks, and like to think I kind of know what I'm doing and what's normal.  \r\nObviously, the nausea and sickness is also normal. However, I suddenly experienced 24 hours of constant vomiting and fainting, not even water would stay down, and I was admitted to the Monklands Hospital, who were very quick to realise I was severely dehydrated and put me on anti-sickness and fluids.  \r\nI couldn't even walk without feeling like I would faint again. During one of these fainting episodes, I broke my nose on tiles. At 5pm the Monklands staff contacted Wishaw to transfer me to a more suitable ward with experience in dehydration in pregnancy and we could hopefully check if the baby was OK and in the right place, as they were concerned it was an ectopic pregnancy.  \r\nWishaw agreed to transfer, so we drove 30 mins over. We waited 3 hours in the waiting room, everything was spinning. At this point I hadn't eaten or drank anything in roughly 24 hours.  \r\nEventually, I went to the midwives' desk and asked how much longer it would take, and they actually asked me why I was there. I was very confused, as the Wishaw team were the ones that confirmed the transfer and would organise more fluids etc. I gave them my name and the midwife at the front actually looked at me and told me that being sick is actually a sign of a healthy pregnancy.  \r\nI've never felt so patronised, it was the worst thing they could have said to me after 24 hours of hell. They wanted me to explain what I expected them to do. I asked if they read my notes, they said yes and yet they still wanted me to explain why I was there. I told them to take the IV thing out of my arm because I wouldn't be staying, I don't care if I pass out again I just wanted to go home.  \r\nI don't know why they allowed us to wait for 3 hours. I don't know why they authorised the transfer if they didn't plan on doing anything. Thankfully, I'm feeling better with the anti-sickness medication.  \r\nI've never abused hospital services, especially with nausea, but I felt so belittled and patronised in that moment that it put me off ever going to Wishaw even if my leg is hanging off.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-12-31T11:21:37.46","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-01-02T09:20:03.41","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lanarkshire","count":11},{"name":"Ulster University, MBBS (Medicine) 2021","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1013116?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1013116"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1013116/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1013116"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1013116/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1013116"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1013116/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1013116"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l106h-maternity?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"l106h-maternity","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l308h_501?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"L308H_501","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/patronised?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"patronised"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/attitude?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/baby%20check?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"baby check"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/belittled?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"belittled"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dehydration?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"dehydration"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fainting?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"fainting"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/maternity?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"maternity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/midwives?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"midwives"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nausea?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"nausea"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pregnancy?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"pregnancy"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1014073?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1014073"}]},{"id":1013176,"author":"Darcy Buttercup","authorRoleId":4,"authorRole":"a relative","title":"Ward doors and patient safety","body":"On visiting Ward 35 for the elderly, I found the door ajar.

Our experience on all 3 occasions is the hospital needs to be a lot larger, and with a lot more staff to deal with the volumes of patients going or being sent there by the 111 service or GPs.  \r\n1st visit, sent by 111 service. Triage took about an hour to be seen and it took 8 hours waiting to see a doctor, only to be told she needed an x-ray (could this not have been decided at the time of triage?). Another 2 hours after the x-ray was spent sitting in the main waiting area to see the doctor again to tell her she has pneumonia and fluid on her lung. A total of 27 hours in A&E before a bed was found.  \r\n2 weeks were spent on Palm ward, staff very good but obviously rushed off their feet. 1 week Hospital at Home care, again the staff that came out were very good. This was followed by 2 visits to the Ambulatory care, where she was discharged on the 2nd visit, despite having a lot of chest pain and still having fluid on the lung.  \r\n2 weeks later, 2nd visit to A&E with the same problem. Once again 7 to 8 hours waiting to see a doctor and another 27 hours before a bed could be found. Once again the nursing staff were very good but some of the doctors could be a lot better! One came to my wife & said: \"have you had cancer before?\" When my wife said, \"No, have I got it now?\" his reply was \"I can't discuss this now until you have a close member of your family with you.\"  \r\nOnce again she was discharged from the ward to the Ambulatory care who saw her one evening in December a couple of days later before discharging her, still with fluid on the lung and spreading into the abdomen.  \r\nLate December, she was taken by ambulance to DVH A&E at 08:30 where bloods and x-rays were done by 09:30. By 12:30 ambulance crews were being told to take new patients back out to the ambulances to hold awaiting space in A&E. Staff were tripping over equipment, each other and patients just trying to treat people. As I have already said most of the staff were very good, but working under immense pressure.  \r\nThere have been thousands of new homes built in Dartford alone, let alone all the other development in the South East since this hospital was built. It just cannot cope with the volumes it is getting at the moment.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-01-01T08:38:04.4066667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-01-02T09:20:03.753","readBy":[{"name":"Dartford and Gravesham NHS Trust","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1013252?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1013252"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1013252/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1013252"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1013252/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1013252"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1013252/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1013252"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rn707_180?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"RN707_180","score":3},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rn707_300?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"RN707_300","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frightened?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"frightened"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20frustrated?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"very frustrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/abdomen?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"abdomen"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breathing?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"breathing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breathing%20problems?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"breathing problems"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/chest%20pain?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"chest pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disorganised?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"disorganised"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctor?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"doctor"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lack%20of%20beds?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"lack of beds"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/more%20staff?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"more staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nursing%20staff?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"nursing staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pneumonia?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"pneumonia"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"waiting"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20under%20pressure?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Staff under pressure"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1025034?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1025034"}]},{"id":1013264,"author":"Sanderal","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"DXA scan, great care - brilliant service!","body":"Karl & Ben very personable and professional.

I want to give a very special mention to the nurses, doctors and porters in A&E, SAU and especially the Sandringham Ward for being absolutely amazing with me, giving me the highest standard of care. They doctors, nurses and porters need to be recognised as they are guardian angels in disguise to me.

From the moment I arrived I cannot speak highly enough of the first class treatment I received from all grades of staff, even though they were under tremendous pressure. Following blood tests and chest X-ray and being hooked up to oxygen, I was informed that I would be admitted to hospital. Due to shortage of beds I stayed in A&E for 24 hours, then transferred to Clifford Ward, then eventually arrived on Harrowden C Ward.  Once again I must commend the staff on these wards for the first class care I received.  I would also like to mention hospital food.  One hears so many bad comments about this subject, but I must say that the menu offered was extensive and something to suit everybody's taste, varied with copious portions.
