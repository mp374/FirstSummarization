They have refused to request my medical records from my Scottish GP which means that I do not have endometriosis on my medical records. They state that my Scottish GP needs to send these over to them, however they have stated they cannot do this unless Park View formally request them. I have informed Park View of this and they have refused.  \r\nI spoke with a lovely GP at Park View after I have been struggling with my symptoms of endometriosis - I suspect I may have another endometrioma cyst. I am in a lot of in the pelvic region and my back. The GP said that I should go and get bloods done to measure CA125 amongst other things which may help put on a rush for a pelvic scan.  \r\nFor the last two weeks, I have had nothing but barriers to get blood tests. My GP practice doesn't have the capacity to book me in for bloods and had to be booked elsewhere to another GP practice which is 40 minutes from home. After arranging time off work and finally finding my way there I was told the appointment was cancelled as the nurse is off sick and that they notified Park View Medical Practice to contact me to cancel. I did not receive any contact whatsoever. I called Park View to ask if I can have blood tests with them as they are nearby, but now I have been sent to somewhere else on a Sunday morning that is much further from home.  \r\nIt is not good enough, I have upcoming deadlines with the university and felt I had no option but to book the Sunday when I have so many added pressures. I do not understand why this GP practice is so unwilling to get my medical history and why I am unable to access a simple blood test that would allow the GP and myself more information about what steps to take forward. I am only young and endometriosis has affected me so much and could risk my future fertility. Sharing information and allowing me access to medical treatment is what I need to manage my symptoms. In Scotland I had a gynaecologist and here it seems I am left with nothing and left to be fighting for the basic things.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-07-12T16:12:11.64","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2022-08-01T09:20:01.24","readBy":[{"name":"Ulster University, MBBS (Medicine) 2021","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/955832?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"955832"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/955832/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"955832"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/955832/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"955832"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/955832/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"955832"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/p81046?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"P81046","score":2},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frustrated?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"frustrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/availability?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"availability"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20test?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"blood test"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20tests?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"blood tests"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cyst?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"cyst"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/endometriosis?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"endometriosis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fertility?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Fertility"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/flexibility?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"flexibility"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gp?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"GP"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/management?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"management"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medical%20records?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"medical records"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pelvic?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"pelvic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scan?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tests?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"tests"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"treatment"}]},{"id":959925,"author":"Disheartened and depressed","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Not easy to book appointments by phone nor online","body":"I was told to phone the practice at 8:00 am to book an appointment.

He was then admitted to the fourth-floor North ward.  \r\nHe had been previously diagnosed with inoperable stage 4 cancer. His wife was told by staff at North Ward that he had barely weeks to live. From the Wednesday he started to suffer severe anxiety to the point where his wife had to stay with him around the clock. She slept on the floor of the room that he was in, whilst her children were being cared for by relatives.  \r\nIn less than a week he had developed multiple bedsores which we considered due to lack of attention from medical staff. His wife had to resort to trying to turn her husband on her own.  \r\nShe was assured that on the morning of his the day in hospital he would be moved to Newry Hospice.  \r\nThe Newry Hospice pastor came to see him to tell that all was prepared for his move to the hospice. When it came to the day he should be moving his wife after waiting sometime, went to inquire why an ambulance hadn’t arrived to take him to the hospice. A staff member told his wife that they had just checked and that there were no ambulances available as they where all on call and he would have to wait until the following morning.  \r\nThe next day, once again after waiting sometime his wife had to go and inquire about the ambulance to take him to the hospice and again she was told that there were no ambulances available as they where all on call and he would have to wait until the following morning.  \r\nThe nurses said they would re-book the ambulance for the following morning. When the next morning came it was the same response - no ambulances available. Three days in a row!  \r\nThe nurses then told his wife that it would be another 5 days before they could move him to Newry Hospice, thus expecting her to lie on the floor of her husband's room for a further, 5 days. Thus causing further anxiety by being separated from their children.  \r\nHis father went to Craigavon hospital in an attempt to get some answers as to what was going on. When he asked the nurses who the head nurse was, they claimed not to know.  \r\nOut of sheer desperation to try to alleviate the suffering of his son and family he said he would have to take the matter to the Nolan Show.  \r\nMeanwhile I rang the hospice in Newry on the 3rd day the ambulance didn't arrive to ask what was going on as Craigavon Hospital was not responding.  \r\nThe Newry Hospice told me that an ambulance was not booked on any of the 3 days we were expecting it.  \r\nThe hospice informed me that a senior staff member at Craigavon Hospital claimed they would personally book him an ambulance so that he would be moved to Newry Hospice the day after.  \r\nAfter my intervention he was finally moved to the hospice on the Thursday. On the following Monday, the very day Craigavon Hospital had claimed that he would be transferred, he passed away. Thankfully due to my intervention he was able to spend his last few days in dignity with his family around him.  \r\nGiven the fact that he only had a short time to live and the situation was obviously very stressful for him, his wife, children and extended family why was he treated so poorly? Surely it was a simple task to book an ambulance to take him to a hospice where he along with his wife and two children could spend the remaining days he had left together in a family room?  \r\nWhy did the staff give false information? If any of the staff had taken the time to check in regards to an ambulance booking they would have seen no ambulance had been booked, but to come back and say they had checked and they were all busy seems nothing less than dishonest.  \r\nWe are all aware of the stresses that the NHS is currently facing but to treat a dying man and his family so poorly cannot be excused. Human error can also not be given as an excuse as the same error could not possible have occurred on three consecutive days.","criticality":"strongly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-07-17T16:19:13.6333333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-08-01T09:58:47.143","readBy":[{"name":"Southern Health and Social Care Trust","count":7},{"name":"Ulster University, MBBS (Medicine) 2021","count":1},{"name":"Patient and Client Council","count":1},{"name":"Public Health Agency","count":1},{"name":"Ulster University, Faculty of Life and Health Sciences","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/957264?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"957264"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/957264/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"957264"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/957264/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"957264"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/957264/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"957264"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_32024-4-north-surgical?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"ZT003_32024-4-north-surgical","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frustrated?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"frustrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/follow-up?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"follow-up"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lack%20of%20compassion?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"lack of compassion"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/passed%20away?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"passed away"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dignity?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Dignity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/misleading%20information?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"misleading information"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20treated?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"not treated"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/963260?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"963260"}]},{"id":961922,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Great practice and its good practises","body":"I have always found the gps helpful and pleasant but to have a text  sent to me when I left a message about having tested positive for covid is both kind and extreme;y helpful.

The staff there were very kind and supportive in the de-escalation of my crisis. I can't thank them enough.  \r\nSadly, at the end of my stay, my experience changed. I was assessed for the home treatment team by two workers. One was very angry and condescending and questioned me in an aggressive police interview fashion. It was overbearing and intimidating. Because I had drank more alcohol than normal on two occasions in the weeks preceding the crisis, I was subjected to a barrage of questions that implied that I was an alcoholic (which I am not, though had difficulties in the past) and was not given sufficient opportunity to collects my thoughts for an appropriate response to contextualise and frame my answers (I was very depressed and feeling very vulnerable). Since I was not in the frame of mind for an argument, I felt the need to lie in order to agree to her questions, confirm and validate her opinion. This was in order to end the session as quickly as possible.  \r\nPart of the assessment included questions on abuse. I answered these honestly and truthfully. Since I have experience of this, I was hoping that a sensitive response would happen. I was to be utterly disappointed. A quick acknowledgement as if it didn't matter. I felt utterly dismissed and unimportant.  \r\nI feel as if I was treat as someone who had done something utterly shameful and abhorrent. I felt belittled, treated as a naughty school child and the session ended with me close to tears, utterly dejected and despondent. The other worker was very quiet, appearing to be disturbed and upset by what they had witnessed.  \r\nThe experience left me feeling numb for a day or two, though later that week, I was so filled with guilt and shame, I self-harmed, with an overwhelming feeling as if I had no right to ask for help, receive support or indeed to live.  \r\nI have since received excellent support from others in the home treatment team. They're dedication, patience and sensitivity is highly commendable.  \r\nI have served the trust as a public governor, I have dedicated many hours of voluntary service to the organisation. I am a mental health professional myself. I am aghast and angered greatly by this behaviour. I still burst into tears, thinking about it. What I wished to say was completely dismissed or twisted to fit that person's narrative.  \r\nI hope notice is taken and that it it will not happened again. No one, let alone some one vulnerable should be spoken too in that manner. I self harmed, others may do something more catastrophic.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-07-30T22:15:37.16","progress":"Story has a

endocrine tests.  \r\nI was having a oral glucose tolerance test over a two hour period to rule out pituitary tumour. Although a healthcare professional myself I was understandably nervous, however I was immediately met with a welcoming smile by Jo, the specialist endocrine nurse. Jo introduced me to a student nurse called Molly who was shadowing her that day and also George the FY1 doctor; both also very welcoming.  \r\nJo talked me through the procedure and made sure I fully understood why the tests were needed and what any results would potentially indicate. I felt very reassured that I was in safe hands with Jo and George. It’s very obvious that Jo cares for her patients and wants them to be as comfortable and relaxed as possible. Jo also took the time to explain things to student nurse Molly so that she also could gain some learning experience. George was also a wonderful doctor and made sure that I was comfortable and feeling ok each time he needed to take more blood.  \r\nThe service that Jo provides to endocrine patients is a credit to Stepping Hill Hospital and I was extremely grateful to have had such wonderful professionals providing care to me.

In the past, being quite bad but I always felt like I wouldn't let it win, as time went on it got worse and alongside a very damaging situation, would put me in the darkest place of my life.  \r\nI was stuck in such a bad cycle of not going out at all unless absolutely necessary, so neglecting my friends, family and partner. I struggled to travel, see anyone or do anything as everything was so overwhelming.  \r\nI'd panic if someone knocked at my door, if I heard post through the letterbox or if someone called me as it was so extreme. So bad that I wouldn't even come out of my room or go downstairs, let alone go outside. This was after my mother sadly passed away - I'd been working but became her carer when she become seriously ill and in return loosing my job due to attendance: I then had all the responsibilities of a new unexpected house owner, grieving, looking after my younger brother and it all weighed down on my mental health and this is where I became stuck in a bad place.  \r\nI doubted anything would change or get better but I was fed up of being in this situation so I sought help. I then began my therapy with Claire: I can't express how much our sessions together overall helped. Claire went well above and beyond to help with my situation. We realised the situation and discussed new routines, changes and tasks that were out of my comfort zone but small goals that were achievable, that would help me overall as the more I do them then the easier they will become, will be breaking my safety behaviours and cycle. Giving me useful tips such as: not listening to any negative thoughts and emotions, not letting them win and realising I can do anything.  \r\nI started accomplishing my goals and getting so many feelings of accomplishment and positivity, realising even though I struggled with my mental health, being anxious and facing them is always a good thing thing as will make everything so much easier. As time went on and the more things I started to do, tasks completed etc, I started noticed myself changing, I didn't need to know the ins and outs of things anymore as I knew I can do it no matter what I faced, whereas before I needed to know everything so I could prepare and in return spend my time worrying.  \r\nI started traveling more, seeing people and feeling more myself the more I did things, being more spontaneous, progressing and facing the things that before i wasn't, as before I was avoiding everything which gave me negative emotions instead of battling these situations and overcoming them, as before I always thought to myself \"I cant\", which we new was the first thing that had to be changed. I was doing things and being better with situations that we hadn't even spoke about facing or doing, I started naturally taking on my new spontaneous tasks and wanting to test and push myself, as knowing that the more I face and do then the more accomplishment and progress I would make. It felt like everything I was doing was changing my ways, thoughts and behaviours even if I didn't realise it.  \r\nThe sessions continued and the steps and tasks I was facing always seemed reasonable to where they seemed achievable, although there may have been more to the tasks over time, they always seemed the same sort of difficulty due to the progress I was making, it got to the point where I was shocked with how far I had become and I was doing things that had seemed near impossible at a time before my therapy started.  \r\nI had rocky moments when I struggled and cancelled or my mental health was fighting me, but I knew that I wasn't going nowhere near where I began and that I will be always going forward no matter what, I would just try again and accomplish it. It's about not giving up and pushing towards going forward, knowing every step is progress, having faith in myself that I can do it, especially with all the evidence I've seen so far.  \r\nEach session Claire would listen to how my week went, how I had accomplished my goals, talking about new steps I could take and giving me useful tips and advice to how to tackle them, listening and being sympathetic when talking about my situations. If there was something I struggled with that week or something didn't go as expected and was getting me down, we would talk about the situation and always come up with a solution. I felt like even if something bad had happened or didn't go as well as expected, it was never a bad thing as there's always a solution and it just means learning from it and doing it better next time.  \r\nI cant say how much this therapy had helped me. I am extremely thankful for my therapist Claire and how helpful, supportive, caring, understanding and empathetic she has been. The amount of progress I have made alongside her guide is absolutely unreal and I'm so thankful for the help to get out of such a dark place, I honestly feel like the person I used to be now which I had thought was lost. I am so glad I had made this decision and wanted to make a change. I felt like the person dying to come out all this time was helped set free due to the guidance and support from Claire. I now feel able to successfully see my goals for the future and know that I have the tools available to tackle them all.  \r\nClaire thank you so much again, you're an amazing therapist!

Woke my wife and asked her to test me for covid. Test was negative  \r\nMy wife dialled 999. I waited for more than and hour for an ambulance to arrive, which is not acceptable. The staff heard my breathing from the front door and were calming and professional. Despite 3 attempts to transfer me to the Royal Victoria Hospital (RVH). I was taken to the Mater. Having been assessed I was informed I had a heart attack and was to be urgently transferred to the RVH where they were waiting for me.

She explained everything so well & reassured me every step of the way.  \r\nThe rest of the team were also fab & working amazingly in what I’m sure is a pressured time within our NHS.  \r\nThank you again.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-07-30T08:59:08.0933333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-08-01T15:26:38.3","readBy":[{"name":"Belfast Health and Social Care Trust","count":9}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/961648?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"961648"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/961648/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"961648"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/961648/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"961648"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/961648/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"961648"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt001-rgh-delivery-suite?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"zt001-rgh-delivery-suite","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/birth?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"birth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/c-section?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"c-section"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/delivery?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"delivery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/efficient?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"efficient"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/epidural?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"epidural"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/induction?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"induction"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/labour?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"labour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professional?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"professional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/calm?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"calm"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confident?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"confident"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tea%20&%20toast?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"tea & toast"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/964491?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"964491"}]},{"id":961560,"author":"JustSomeADHD","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"CBT to help deal with recently diagnosed adult ADHD","body":"I have recently completed a 12 week CBT course with Inclusion Thurrock and I wanted to share my story for the life changing experience that I have received.  \r\nMy journey with Inclusion started a couple of years ago. I had been off of work with stress, depression and anxiety and my symptoms were not getting any better. After lots of frustrated calls with my GP I contacted inclusion to see if they could help. I ended up getting put through to the clinical lead and actually broke down on the phone to them. They were the first person I felt actually listened to me and wanted to help. I had convinced myself that I had developed a personality disorder or had Bi-Polar, and they didn't dismiss this, they listened to me and then arranged for an assessment by the local mental health team. The result of which was a diagnosis of ADHD in December of last year at 40 years of age.  \r\nI enquired about therapy with both my GP and Psychiatrist and didn't get anywhere with either of them, my psychiatrist actually doubted the benefits of non ADHD targeted CBT. I decided to come back to Inclusion with the diagnosis and see if CBT would be able to assist the medication, when it started. After quite a wait and a couple of group sessions I was assigned a therapist and arranged our first appointment. There was a large amount of scepticism, partly due to previous experiences and also due to my psychiatrist sowing a seed of doubt with someone not considered a specialist performing ADHD CBT. This all disappeared after my first meeting with the therapist arranged by Inclusion!  \r\nI will struggle to put into words just how much my life has changed in the hands of them, but I feel I need to get this out there! I was a complete mess a little over 13 weeks ago. Depressed, anxious and feeling worthless. No job, arguing with my wife all the time and just flat out miserable and done with life. I had waited and waited for my assessment, diagnosis and finally my medication but without therapy nothing was changing. I had the tools but lacked the knowledge to use them.  \r\nThe therapy I received completely changed everything. It felt targeted, personal and actually changed my life week by week, to the point where I think I'm actually in the best place I've ever been, in my head. I gained confidence in myself and my abilities and was able to get back to work. Not just to any job either, back to a job that I had basically sworn to never go back to. I have only been back 2 months and have already received employee of the month and got a promotion. My relationship with my partner is so much better along with my relationship with my children. All of this wouldn't have been possible without the help I received from CBT with Inclusion Thurrock.  \r\nEach week my therapist would listen as I rambled through what had been going on with me. All the while he was carefully listening and guiding me to where I needed to be, and it felt so natural too. My ADHD can make me put off things or try to get out of them but this never happened during my sessions with Inclusion. Each week I looked forward to our meetings and I didn't miss any that I could have attended, but didn't, which is quite a big thing for me.  \r\nThe work done at Inclusion Thurrock really does change lives, I have experienced it and it is honestly incredible. I'll never forget this experience and what it did for me, I can't thank my therapist enough for everything he's done for me and my family! Is it weird that I miss our meetings now they are over?","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-07-29T22:42:19.6966667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-08-01T15:27:38.517","readBy":[{"name":"Midlands Partnership NHS Foundation Trust","count":5}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/961560?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"961560"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/961560/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"961560"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/961560/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"961560"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/961560/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"961560"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rrex4-inclusion-thurrock?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"rrex4-inclusion-thurrock","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stress?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"stress"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/adhd?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"ADHD"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cbt?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"cbt"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cbt%20therapist?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"CBT therapist"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/depression?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"depression"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20tools?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"given tools"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/regained%20confidence?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"regained confidence"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/listened%20to?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"listened to"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/962777?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"962777"}]},{"id":962011,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Lung Function","body":"I visited my local GP surgery for a review of my suspected COPD and although the nurse confirmed that I had moderate COPD, I was delighted with her assessment, explanation and treatment of my condition.

I had the surgery in May and just wanted to thank the staff there for a job well done! Dr Shepherd, and nurses Carolyn and Andrea were excellent and I felt in good hands from the start. Dr Shepherd told me everything I needed to know, answered all the questions I had, and they all generally put me at ease with their relaxed and friendly manner.  \r\nI was given IV sedation which was fantastic; one minute I'm chatting about growing veg; the next thing I know it's over an hour later and I'm looking at my tooth! I had to fast beforehand, and this was the only thing I was really concerned about, as if I get anxious I can burn through a lot of energy and end up with a low blood sugar if I don't eat enough (I don't have any medical issue such as diabetes though). In the end, I got up very early and had some breakfast within the guidelines given, and this tided me over fine until my rice pudding back at home. I wouldn't have got away with just having a big tea/supper the previous night. Just throwing this in here in case anyone else has the same concern and feels like it's only them.  \r\nI had no problems afterwards, just an understandably achy and stiff jaw.

I saw other people that came in get straight through, which is also a joke considering there were very sick and unhappy people waiting beforehand.  \r\nFalkirk is getting let down big style by this and I would love for this to be taken seriously and further looked at if possible.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-07-30T01:09:39.5533333","progress":"Made change","dateOfPublication":"2022-08-01T15:31:09.22","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Forth Valley","count":7},{"name":"Scottish Government","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/961562?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"961562"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/961562/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"961562"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/961562/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"961562"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/961562/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"961562"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/forth-valley-royal-ae?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"forth-valley-royal-ae","score":1},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helpless?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"helpless"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/more%20staff?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"more staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/terrible?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"terrible"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting%20times?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"waiting times"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helping%20people?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"helping people"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pains?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"pains"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/962362?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"962362"}]},{"id":961690,"author":"elephantct64","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Came in for a top up on contraception","body":"Arrived for my appointment and was seen straight away.

The lack of signage may seem a minor issue but this is a very basic requirement for a hospital full of stressed patients and relatives! Its absence prevented me from asking questions about what to expect.  I was then asked by a nurse to empty by bladder - which I didn't because it was already empty and I was drinking a mug of water at the time - and the next thing I knew I was in a room with the nurse, a consultant and 1 other person who didn't introduce themselves.  They were all pleasant and helpful but I was left feeling how much less stressful it would have been to have had better communication, especially as I was feeling unwell for an unrelated reason.
