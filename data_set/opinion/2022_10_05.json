Last February I asked my GP to refer me to mental health team for assessment. I had multiple appointments booked and all of them cancelled. Most recently I was supposed to have assessment in August, which was cancelled without any knowledge to me, then rescheduled to today (I only received the letter 4 days ago), but today again nobody rang me. I tried ringing them after multiple different departments. I was finally told that yes my appointment was rescheduled for next month.  \r\nThey do not seem to care. I have been begging to be seen, to have some sort of help but they just do not appear to care. I was very upset this morning with the lack of care on their part but all they could say is I need to ring the crisis team as they will be able to talk to me. I do not need to talk to crisis team I need actual help. I need someone to listen and guide me which just is not happening.  \r\nI feel I am being let down over and over again and honestly because of this I feel more suicidal than ever. I have restarted using strong antidepressants since the last appointment was just cancelled and nobody let me know about it. I can wholeheartedly say that my mental health has gone downhill due to them ignoring my begs for help.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-10-04T09:10:31.29","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2022-10-05T08:16:43.847","readBy":[{"name":"Coventry and Warwickshire Partnership NHS Trust","count":1},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2022)","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/981221?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"981221"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/981221/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"981221"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/981221/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"981221"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/981221/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"981221"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/ryg_710?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"RYG_710","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ignored?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"ignored"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lack%20of%20care?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Lack of care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sad?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"sad"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/should%20listen?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Should listen"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/broken%20promises?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"broken promises"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cancellations?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"cancellations"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/depressed?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"depressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unwanted?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"unwanted"}]},{"id":980702,"author":"oscarbr38","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Helpful receptionist","body":"I had never been to the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital, and was unsure where I had to go for my Macular eye injections.

It has been absolutely fine on this ward. All the staff have been very friendly and very nice. When it comes to communication with staff it has been alright - their explanations have been good.  \r\nThe food has been alright - I don't have much of an appetite but it has been alright.

I can ring back every morning at 8.30 am or every afternoon at 2.30pm in the hope there may be one, but there may not be one, I was told. I explained I work and don’t have the type of job where I can leave to make a call. The receptionist said ‘there’s nothing we can do!’ And ‘I haven’t got any appointments for you!’ Asked for an appointment at West Heath and was told I couldn’t have one there (have had appointments there previously), was questioned about why I was ringing in detail (this isn’t a nurse triaging needs). I stressed the urgency of needing to see/speak to a doctor, she asked me to leave it with her (suggesting there are appointments available), just to ring me back to tell me to ring back this afternoon or go to A & E (not the place I should be going). Rang back this afternoon and was told ‘there are no appointments available at the moment’ Told to phone the Walk-in Centre (not an option this morning). Booked an appointment as a back up - 10 days time. This time it was offered as a face to face appointment (not an option given this morning). Since spent an hour so far on the phone to the walk in centre with 5 people ahead of me, and no change in this.\nThis is consistent practice for this surgery. Please consider that the current system is not working and make changes. We cannot register at another practice but equally, it is virtually impossible to get appointments here. Even the online booking system is not up and running anymore, meaning the surgery is flooded with calls that cannot respond effectively to. Having a non-medically trained person triaging your needs and questioning you for sensitive information is unacceptable, especially when it is met with no empathy. And being told constantly that there is nothing we can do for you, when you are at your most vulnerable and reaching out for help, does not reflect any care values among the NHS. \nI am pleased to say seeing/speaking to a Doctor here has always been a good experience.

The staff were all brilliant during the echo. I was then admitted onto the Coronary Care ward following the echo.  \r\nIt has been absolutely great on the ward. The staff have all been absolutely great – I have had no problems with them. I would particularly like to mention nurses Grainne and Caitlin. They have been absolutely excellent and fantastic. Marty the cleaner has also been very good – he has been very nice and helps keep the ward clean and tidy. Communication with staff has also been good.  \r\nWhen it comes to the food – it really needs to be improved. I don’t eat it a lot of the time as it is just not to the appropriate standard. Breakfast is particularly bad – it is always very bland and very dry. I cannot even bring myself to order breakfast.  \r\nThe only other issue I have noticed would be in regards to the toilet. Sometimes there are samples sitting in there for over an hour – this shouldn’t be the case.  \r\nApart from this, my stay has been good and I have had no other issues.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-10-02T15:26:23.8966667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-10-05T08:46:49.487","readBy":[{"name":"Southern Health and Social Care Trust","count":6}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/980709?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"980709"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/980709/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"980709"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/980709/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"980709"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/980709/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"980709"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_33020_320?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"ZT003_33020_320","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bathroom?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"bathroom"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cleaning%20staff?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"cleaning staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/coronary%20care?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"coronary care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctors?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"doctors"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/echocardiogram?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Echocardiogram"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/food?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"food"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/looked%20after?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"looked after"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/toilet?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"toilet"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/quicker%20results?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"quicker results"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fine?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"fine"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/982300?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"982300"}]},{"id":981591,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Wonderful team","body":"I went and had my annual flu job at Crownhill Surgery/Pathfields.

I recently had cause to request an appointment.  Upon calling, I was faced with 15 minutes of questions (very personal) about the condition, by a receptionist.  All I wanted was an appointment to see my doctor.  Upon asking why so many questions, the reply was \"they have asked for as much information as possible\".  When i pointed out that all was in my file, the comment was \"we don't have time to look at records\".  During the questioning, comments such as \"well that's not that bad\" were made.

After having explained my father in law’s symptoms - unable to stand, very disorientated and incoherent. Told by the ambulance caller that “it wasn’t an ambulance case” and I was instructed to phone the GP or NHS24, I questioned calling the GP at the week-end- they asked if I had understood what had been said - which I clearly did, but didn’t agree with it! Which didn’t make them happy. Now let me tell you we do not call an ambulance lightly.  \r\nI then called NHS24 as the GP Surgery isn’t open at the week-end. I was on hold for 45mins and eventually the call was ended at 1hr 15mins. During the call I explained that this is the way that he goes when he has an infection. He was found to have contracted E Coli after his last hospital admittance (he has a catheter). This was never verbally explained to anyone. We had tested him for Covid by this point, which was negative. She said that an out of hours doctor would call.  \r\n00.38 On call doctor called. They said there was no point in coming down as he would probably end up going to hospital anyway! They would call an ambulance to take patient to hospital, I asked for a rough time scale one hour!  \r\n01.38 no ambulance. Took his temperature 38.6  \r\n03.08 call came from ambulance control informed her of rise in temperature now 39.0  \r\n03.37 call from ambulance control - an ambulance was on its way.  \r\n04.15 ambulance arrived temp now 39.4  \r\n05.15 ambulance arrived at IRH. The ambulance staff showed genuine care.  \r\n05.45 wife allowed to go in.  \r\nGoing to a ward…we left hospital at 07.45.  \r\nThis was the story of a nearly 80 year old who has had two strokes and who has recurring infections (no one has specifically explained what type and where the infections are).  \r\nSince being admitted to hospital on a regular occurrence and with recurring UTI (we think) he has never once been visited by his own GP. All antibiotics have either been prescribed by a Nurse practitioner (not from own GP Practice) or a doctor over the phone.  \r\nUrine samples have been handed in, but never has a sample been asked for after a course of antibiotics.  \r\nHe is still in hospital over 10 days after the call - no doctor/consultant has spoken to update the family. He is only now able to hold a cup and drink by himself - he is still talking gobbledegook and on an IV Drip.

So, you're obliged to go back and phone, blocking up the queuing system.  I was then told no, I wouldn't be able to book an appointment online because the GP I'm registered with has just gone on maternity leave.  [How was I to know?/ was her maternity leave not scheduled well in advance?/ couldn't the website have been updated?]. I'm writing this comment here because I couldn't find any email address for the surgery.  [How many public organisations deny access to an email address these days? ] So, a suggestion, please: can the Village Surgery in Harpenden please invest in a better website and have it properly managed? This isn't rocket science and the current inefficiencies negatively impact on you and your patients - the waiting times by phone are extraordinary, partly as a result of an online system that doesn't work & the absence of an email facility.

I was told to call 111 which I did and spoke to the call handler. I described what was going on. They spoke with him and decided that he was not well and went to speak to a nurse who then advised that they could send an ambulance but it would take up to 6 hours.  \r\nI decided if I could get help from Homecare staff to get him to Hospital A&E, I would take him myself, which I did. I felt totally alone, disgusted and in fear for for my brothers life.
