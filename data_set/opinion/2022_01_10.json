[{"id":906850,"author":"Cute.duckie","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Feel like I was treated like a second class citizen","body":"I called NHS 24 two days ago as I had severe pain in my mouth. I got an out of hours appointment next day at Wishaw General where they extracted my tooth. However today (one day after extraction) I have excruciating pain all on right side of face including jaw and ear I haven't got a dentist yet because they can't see me until mid Feb to register me due to being busy because of covid.  \r\nTherefore I called NHS 24 this afternoon as nothing was helping my pain and I'm in agony. I got a lovely man who explained that there was a number I could call during the day to try to get seen...he stayed on the line to check if I got help. The number was for the community dental line which sees patients that are not registered with a dentist and have urgent pain. When I spoke to them it was discovered I am registered at a dentist but I explained that it is in an area I cannot return to due to previous serious domestic issues. I was told that they couldn't just see anyone and everyone because they would be over stretched. They even checked with their clinical supervisor who said the same.....where was the compassion? My right to treatment?  \r\nI have now been left for approx 7 hours in severe pain. I called NHS 24 again this evening at 5.17pm approx as I just can't stand the pain anymore and I was told off cos this is for when doctors and dentists are closed. I said I can't get a dentist and basically told that I need to get one as I can't keep being treated by the NHS basically (this extraction was done out of hours as I haven't got a dentist and I now have issues next day). I was told I would have to call back at 6pm, bearing in mind this was 5.17pm and its taking over an hour at a time to get through. I was told again that there was nothing they could do for me until 6pm.  \r\nI appreciate that the community dental team have rules but I gave a valid reason as to why I couldn't go to my registered dentist of over 2 years ago because of covid and ptsd due to what happened. I have tried relentlessly to get registered in my new area, however due to covid it is impossible. As I said above it will be mid Feb before I can get registered here. Anyways I was really upset when I came off the phone and I told NHS 24 that there was nothing the community dental team could do. Its now 17.54 and I just know I'll wait ages to get through again and I'll be told they can't see me until tomorrow which means being left in severe pain for 24 hours which is cruel!","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-01-05T17:56:58.4666667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-01-10T09:20:01.31","readBy":[{"name":"NHS 24","count":33},{"name":"NHS Lanarkshire","count":5},{"name":"Office of Colin Smyth, MSP for South Scotland","count":1},{"name":"St. Andrews University ScotGEM Medical Students","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/906850?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"906850"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/906850/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"906850"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/906850/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"906850"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/906850/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"906850"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l308h_450?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"L308H_450","score":5},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/nhs24?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"NHS24","score":1},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frustrated?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"frustrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/access%20to%20services?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"access to services"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dental?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"dental"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/face?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"face"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/inconsiderate?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"inconsiderate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/jaw?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"jaw"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lack%20of%20compassion?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"lack of compassion"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lovely%20staff?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"lovely staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/out-of-hours%20dental%20service?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"out-of-hours dental service"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ptsd?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"ptsd"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/severe%20pain?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"severe pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tooth?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"tooth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting%20times?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"waiting times"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassion?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"compassion"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/907679?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"907679"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/907692?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"907692"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/907696?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"907696"}]},{"id":907344,"author":"Reviwer21","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Very poor service at childrens speech therapy","body":"I am shocked and saddened at the quality and scope of the service offered to children needing speech therapy in the Nottingham area , the service has been practically desalinated since I accessed this initially and is no longer fit for purpose . My child has not seen a therapist face to face since February 2020 despite the Therapist acknowledging he has severe and profound needs . We get a maximum of three sessions over MS Teams, despite me asking/begging specifically for in person appointment in school , the environment where my child spends most of their day . The first virtual appointment was incredibly poor , discussion only with me and no interaction at all with my child , they gave recommendations based solely on what I said , I am not a trained therapist and could also have a very different idea of what my child’s needs are versus their actual need! i have repeatedly been advised the service will no longer work through school or even discuss therapy with school unless I contact them directly to ask them to speak with school , which adds unecssary barriers to joined up working . Whilst I am pro active and am constantly calling , how many parents are unable to do so? I have asked several times for the evidence that management are referring to that supports their current model of zero face to face interaction and to add insult to injury, a 3 session max limit before a child is discharged under the guise of ‘ episodic care ‘ why is this not the 6 clinical sessions / twice termly visits that I know other children were previously offered. What model of best practise is being followed? I have contacted the royal college of speech therapy about this who are also concerned about the model of service delivery as it apparently does not follow the evidence. Managers have been brusque and dismissive when I asked to speak with them , the standard reponse from the senior staff I spoke with ignored my concerns and instead cited a generic ‘manager speak’ response about how well they feel the service is being received with high levels of parental engagement and satisfaction … I don't know which parents are rating this service so highly! I leave conversations feeling frustrated and unheard, I also worry greatly on a larger scale for those children who’s parents are less able to constantly advocate or even to call , what happens to these children? I have now decided to look into private therapy as it seems like this service views my child as a tickbox, that they feel they have ticked all boxes onlt to offer of virtual appointments only. If all staff are vaccinated and there are no lockdown restrictions, how are they justifying such a reduced service?","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-01-07T14:40:50.63","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-01-10T09:20:01.823","readBy":[{"name":"Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust","count":8},{"name":"Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists (RCSLT)","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/907344?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"907344"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/907344/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"907344"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/907344/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"907344"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/907344/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"907344"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rha20-paediatric-salt?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"rha20-paediatric-salt","score":1},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frustrated?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"frustrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/shocked?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"shocked"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/worried?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"worried"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/access%20to%20services?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"access to services"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appointment%20availability?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Appointment availability"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/saddened?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Saddened"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/speech%20therapy?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"speech therapy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attitude?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"staff attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unheard?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"unheard"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reduced%20service?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"reduced service"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/face%20to%20face%20contact?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"face to face contact"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dismissive%20managers?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"dismissive managers"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/907672?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"907672"}]},{"id":907363,"author":"Lizziekay76","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Having my mirena coil fitted","body":"I was welcomed by a lovely young lady who booked me in and handed me to the care of Juliet.

After we had done what we needed to do, I was introduced to Dr Bretland, who was actually going to do the fitting of my coil. She was so very friendly and reassuring. I was a little nervous. She explained very clearly what was going to happen and walked me through everything in a manner I understood, which really did relax me a lot. While the coil was actually being fitted, she asked me repeatedly if I was ok and if she was hurting me. She told me what she was going to do before she did it. That made me feel part of it and it eased my fears. After it was all done, I was uncomfortable and had cramps. Juliet very kindly got me a glass of water and told me to wait till I was ok.

I don't think so. I have been a patient at this Surgery since 1978, but over the last 4/5 years its services have been on a sharp decline. Now everything is put at the door of 'Coronavirus'. It's extremely difficult to get an appointment or even a phone call. I managed to get a phone appointment where the Doctor prescribed some medication. That evening I went to the Chemist to collect it, but they hadn't received the prescription. When I managed to get through to the Surgery, I was told that the Doctor had forgotten to sign the prescription so it delayed for another 24 hours.\nThe next day I had another phone appointment which ended up with a referral to a Hospital of my choice. I waited 8 weeks or so and rang that Hospital to see if they had received my referral. They hadn't. I rang the Surgery, only to find out that it hadn't been sent.\nIt finally did get sent, only to find out after another 8 weeks that the referral was sent to the wrong hospital. At each time when I rang the Surgery I requested to speak with the Practice Manager but to date she hasn't had the courtesy or time to call me. So, after waiting all these weeks and months I continue to suffer in pain every minute of the day because, from where I am sitting, there is a distinct lack of care and compassion or even understanding. They haven't even got the time to say sorry!\nIn the meantime I am still on the list of a Hospital that I never asked for which the Surgery was going to correct, but hasn't yet.\nIs this what our National Health come down to, or is it just Dishley Grange that is giving the NHS a bad name?","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-01-09T17:58:27","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-01-10T11:51:57","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/907688?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"907688"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/907688/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"907688"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/907688/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"907688"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/907688/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"907688"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/c82103?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"C82103","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lack%20of%20care?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Lack of care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/forgotten?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"forgotten"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/in%20pain?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"in pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/strong?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"strong"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"put off"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/forgotten%20about?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"forgotten about"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/909607?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"909607"}]},{"id":907435,"author":"decemberpw37","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"A nurse working non stop","body":"I had to visit Glasgow Royal Infirmary today as requested by my doctor.

She is now 12 weeks pregnant and has had various antiemetics from her GP none of which helped. She was checked by her GP and found to have 3+ ketones in her urine and was correctly referred to maternity service at the Princess Royal maternity hospital in Glasgow. Her care since then has been nothing short of appalling.  \r\nDespite being really sick she had to wait an hour and a half on her own in a waiting room that felt like a sauna. Her urine and bloods were checked then she was given a short course of IV fluids and an antiemetic injection which did not help at all. She was not scanned and had nothing rechecked before being sent home just as sick as when she went in. She asked for alternative antiemetics only to be told the doctors were too busy and she couldn’t have any for 3 days.  \r\nA family member gave the unit a call to say she couldn’t cope without medication for the next 3 days as she is constantly sick and current treatment is not working and was told a midwife would call my sister to arrange something. That didn’t happen.  \r\nThey phoned back and eventually someone phoned my sister to say as she hadn’t yet had a scan ( which should have been done when she was in) she couldn’t be given the treatment.  \r\nShe now has 3+ ketones in her urine again which is bad for mother and baby but despite the maternity unit staff being informed of this hours ago she still has not received any contact.  \r\nThere is a ggc obsgyn handbook which sets out what should happen in this situation and those procedure were not followed. Care of patients with nausea and vomiting in pregnancy and hyperemesis gravidarum need to be reviewed in my opinion, and appropriate staff training put in place.  \r\nIf my sisters care does not improve her husband plans to take things further with the healthboard.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-01-08T15:44:58.84","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-01-10T13:41:02.53","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":11}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/907529?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"907529"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/907529/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"907529"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/907529/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"907529"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/907529/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"907529"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/g108h-epas?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"g108h-epas","score":2},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appalled?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"appalled"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/call%20back?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"call back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fluids?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"fluids"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/injection?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"injection"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ketones?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"ketones"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/maternity?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"maternity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nausea?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"nausea"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pregnancy?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"pregnancy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pregnant?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"pregnant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scan?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vomiting?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"vomiting"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting%20area?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"waiting area"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20kept%20informed?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"not kept informed"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/907731?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"907731"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/907778?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"907778"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/907851?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"907851"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/907898?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"907898"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/907946?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"907946"}]},{"id":907532,"author":"Ches Bes","authorRoleId":4,"authorRole":"a relative","title":"Excellent care provided to my mother","body":"My elderly mother Helen B became seriously unwell with a chest infection and we were advised by her GP that she would need to go into hospital.

She then explained in full, the acute care package that was to be instigated. For the next 2 weeks, every day, there was nurses, doctors, a consultant geriatrician, physiotherapists and occupational therapists visiting. She made a slow but steady recovery. After the acute phase she was discharged from hospital care & a 6 week care package was set in place.We would like to express our gratitude to all the staff that attended my mum. We were delighted with the care & attention she received from every one that visited. The staff were all kind, friendly and very courteous.

So a big thank you to everyone, you are all amazing and deserve the acknowledgment of how great the care is that you deliver.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-01-10T13:48:14.2233333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-01-10T14:22:29.53","readBy":[{"name":"Royal Devon University Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust","count":7}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/907702?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"907702"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/907702/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"907702"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/907702/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"907702"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/907702/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"907702"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rbz12_501?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"RBZ12_501","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/birth?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"birth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/caring?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"caring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/considerate?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"considerate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/delivery?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"delivery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helpful?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"helpful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"amazing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/relaxed?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"relaxed"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/909717?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"909717"}]},{"id":907708,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Absolutely shocking Practice","body":"The reception staff clearly don’t listen to patients when requesting specific types of appointments & are incompetent.

The activity class was held every Friday at 10am which was also attended by other patients.  \r\nJoe was highly organised in his approach to every class which started at 10am and finished at 10:40am. Joe would start with warm-up exercises then moved on to general strengthening and conditioning exercises, requiring light weights for later exercises. Although I would consider myself to be reasonably fit I looked forward to each class as Joe's exercises catered for all fitness levels so I always felt I got something out of the class. Also, Joe kept the interest going with well-timed banter and I particularly enjoyed the scientific patter about the benefits of certain exercises, e.g. this exericse is good for strengthening your quads / glutes, etc.Overall, I found the class to be benefical, motivating and enjoyable. Well done to Joe for keeping it all going.  \r\n","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-01-10T14:22:03.63","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-01-10T14:28:59.167","readBy":[{"name":"Belfast Health and Social Care Trust","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/907704?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"907704"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/907704/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"907704"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/907704/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"907704"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/907704/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"907704"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt001_02020?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"ZT001_02020","score":5},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt001_02020-pac?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"ZT001_02020-pac","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/enjoyable?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"enjoyable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fitness?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"fitness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/great?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"great"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/inspiring?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"inspiring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/involvement?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"involvement"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/organised?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"organised"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/physical%20activity?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"physical activity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/well%20done?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"well done"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confidence?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"confidence"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/motivating?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"motivating"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/motivational?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"motivational"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/improved%20health?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"improved health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/improved%20mobility?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"improved mobility"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/beneficial?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"beneficial"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/907845?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"907845"}]},{"id":907713,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Great nursing care","body":"Had day surgery and can highly recommend the care from reception to theatre and after care.\nMy one suggestion for improvement would be not to have to wait 5 hours from checking in.

I want to thank Margaret, or as we call her ''Maggie'' for her care. I woke up this morning greeted by a cup of tea at my bedside... what more could you want! Doctor Moore has also been incredible- his positive attitude most definitely permeates across to the other staff. My care plan is made so clear and the staff are approachable. The hygiene is perfect and the food is lovely... I have paid for worse!  \r\nI unfortunately caught Covid-19 whilst being in hospital, which was an annoyance, but the staff continued to be resilient and help me get through this struggle. The only complaint I would have would be that one of my windows doesn't close properly. This is manageable during the day but at night it is very unpleasant. I need to have three blankets over me to keep myself warm... I have circulation issues, so the cold air certainly doesn't help.  \r\nAside from that, I honestly couldn't thank everyone enough for my care.

I can't thank them all enough on their compassion, understanding, care and kindness to name just a few of their fabulous attributes. I was very reluctant about asking for help at the time and didn't expect anything let alone the whole panoply of help that happened so quickly and humanely. I felt above anything else believed and to me this means more than anything. The whole ethos of this remarkable team is so far away from many many experiences I have had in my years in and out of the MH system. They gave me hope from the outset and the knowledge that they would always be there has been a great comfort. Plus the knowledge that should I need help in the future I now know that the hoops and obstacles that have blighted my attempts to be referred back into MH over the years and would in the main make me reluctant to ask for help are not in the main required by MH for Older People. This ethos means that for the first time I am feeling fine about being discharged with the full knowledge that their safety net will catch me should I fall. Everyone I have worked with whether on a regular basis or only on occasion has to me the core elements that makes any health professional effective and successful at their job and is the combination of humanity and being down to earth. Both these elements are to be found in spades within this team. I cannot praise them enough. I do not know whether I am allowed to name individuals I have had most interactions with but suffice it to say they know who they are . And I'm not simply counting the clinical staff in that statement I also wish to thank all the office / admin staff. \n\nI would not hesitate to recommend Alexander House to anyone who needs help but may be hesitant due to maybe having negative experiences with MH services in the past. \n\nI must now quite simply state that I give this team and ancillary staff what they deserve and 5 stars are nowhere near enough. \n\n","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-01-10T11:10:47","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-01-10T16:20:13","readBy":[{"name":"Healthwatch North Yorkshire","count":1},{"name":"Tees, Esk and Wear Valleys NHS Foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/907771?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"907771"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/907771/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"907771"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/907771/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"907771"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/907771/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"907771"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rx3xl?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"RX3XL","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/alone?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"alone"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/great?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"great"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20believed?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"not believed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"amazing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hope?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Hope"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reluctant?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"reluctant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fine?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"fine"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/no%20hope?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"no hope"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/908151?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"908151"}]},{"id":907768,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Very Poor ","body":"I signed up to this surgery last year & yet to see my GP.
