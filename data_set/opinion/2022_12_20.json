He had pneumonia and had had this previously confirmed by X-ray.  \r\nOn this afternoon doctors on the ward decided he should have a stomach x-ray due to pain in his abdomen.

As a family we are deeply disturbed by these events and feel he deserved dignity in his passing.

His carer was very concerned at how weak he was and why he had been discharged. We got hold of the district nurse team who then contacted the ward. What appeared to be a disturbed patient answered the phone and also did so when I called later.  \r\nThe ward is adamant that my father was ambulatory and fit for discharge which is completely the opposite of what we now see. When visiting the ward during the week we could never see or speak to the one nurse who appeared to be on duty and the health care assistants were all too busy to provide any sort of update on my Dad. We are waiting with my Dad at home over the weekend in the hope that other services may be able to assist.

He quickly referred me to Dr Hill at endocrinology at Wishaw General Hospital - as this was through the pandemic I was seen virtually. Dr Hill investigated thoroughly what was causing my thyroid issues and it was discovered I had nodules on my thyroid gland. He gave me my options for treatment and I decided to try the Radio Iodine treatment, which he then referred me to Dr Mukhopadhyay at Monklands hospital.  \r\nAgain I was seen quickly and 6 weeks later I was treated with Radio Iodine treatment at Monklands Hospital. I was quite anxious about this treatment but Dr Mukhopadhay and the doctors at Monklands Hospital did everything to put my mind at ease. I had no negative side effects of the radio iodine treatment apart from having to stay isolated from others for three weeks.  \r\nThe follow up appointment with Nurse Kerry to get my bloods taken have shown that my bloods are now normal and at this stage it looks like the radio iodine has done exactly what it was intended for and my thyroid is working normally at the moment. Future blood tests will determine whether this continues. However I am hopeful.  \r\nThank you again for all those individuals involved in my care and to NHS Lanarkshire in keeping me well informed and part of the process of my care.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-12-18T10:54:19.93","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-12-20T11:00:22.177","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lanarkshire","count":3}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1009293?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1009293"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1009293/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1009293"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1009293/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1009293"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1009293/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1009293"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l106h-endo?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"l106h-endo","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l308h-mdia?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"l308h-mdia","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sl9-gp?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"sl9-gp","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20tests?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"blood tests"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctors?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"doctors"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/endocrinology?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"endocrinology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gp%20surgery?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"GP surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/involved?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"involved"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kept%20informed?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"kept informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/looked%20after?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"looked after"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/prompt%20service?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"prompt service"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thorough?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"thorough"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thyroid?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"thyroid"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hopeful?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"hopeful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20at%20ease?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"put at ease"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pandemic?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"pandemic"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1009919?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1009919"}]},{"id":1009298,"author":"frostde44","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Down to Earth Gynaecology Consultant","body":"Was put on a 2 week wait ,on the day of my appointment the consultant Sarah was very down to earth and after an examination I had my treatment and am very pleased with the outcome.

She was more interested in getting her notes done than anything else.  \r\nI had been following hypnobirthing and doula advice throughout my pregnancy and breathing techniques to be then told to push as if I’m constipated, chin to chest and hold my breath without being able to take a breath back in resulting in me spewing (also that seemed to annoy her too) I ended up getting forceps, episiotomy and then opened up again to get my placenta removed in theatre.  \r\nEverything I dreaded about labour I didn’t want had happened to me which has made me still in agony and not able to enjoy my newborn when I’m still unfit and mentally has affected me. I personally think midwife’s like her should get her head out a book from the dark ages and into a hypnobirthing one and rethink her methods.  \r\nIf I had the first midwife for the second part I feel things would’ve went smoother. Even my forceps midwife had to tell the second midwife to get out of the room.  \r\nAnother staff member was brilliant also.

On Friday evening I was diagnosed with a potentially life threatening condition called subarachnoid hemorrhage. My GP immediately told me to go to A&E at the royal infirmary  \r\nOn arrival I found that the GP had not bothered to even write this in my notes so I was triaged for 8.5 hours for a brain injury. I finally got a CT scan but the Dr noted as its taken so so so so long to get the scan done it's not conclusive.  \r\nI was then told to come back at 9am for a lumbar puncture. On arrival I was told I would have to wait a few hours. I finally got my appointment (meant for 9am) at 16:15 where sadly I couldn't go ahead with it due to extreme fear and anxiety. I wasn't allowed to do it under general anesthetic because there was noone to do it.  \r\nSo now I've been told just to randomly phone back on Monday morning to book this in. If I have a subarachnoid hemorrhage I could in fact be dead by then. I have never been so scared in my entire life. From the reception staff to the nurses to the Doctors, I have been treated extremely poorly and with often a lot of rudeness.  \r\nI am now sitting about my house in constant full panick mode because

She went above and beyond for me. I asked for epidural but the anaesthetist was struggling to find the right spot and stopped after 10 times trying. I was in so much pain and wanted the epidural so badly, therefore my midwife fought for me to have another try in the theatre room.  \r\nMy baby's heartbeat was down and up and there were 2 senior doctors in the room, but they just put the pressure on the midwife. Even when the midwife was asking for help they didn’t provide her with support. My baby was born and was not breathing. My midwife was trying to make the baby breathe, whereas the senior doctors were just watching and not helping out, even though she shouted for help. My husband had to press the emergency button as my midwife was holding the baby and trying to get her breath back.  \r\nI was in total shock with the senior doctors' reactions. They did not write anything up for me for records apart from my midwifes notes.  \r\nI feel the senior doctors should have helped the midwife more.

Other than that, I am content in AMU.","criticality":"minimally critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-12-18T12:33:57.81","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-12-20T12:02:15.073","readBy":[{"name":"Southern Health and Social Care Trust","count":3}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1009295?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1009295"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1009295/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1009295"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1009295/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1009295"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1009295/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1009295"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_32024_300?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"ZT003_32024_300","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/acute%20medical%20unit?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Acute Medical Unit"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cleanliness?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"cleanliness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disabled?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"disabled"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/facilities?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"facilities"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/food?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"food"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helpful%20staff?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"helpful staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kept%20informed?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"kept informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/showers?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"showers"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happy?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20at%20ease?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"put at ease"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1011018?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1011018"}]},{"id":1009296,"author":"Katee95","authorRoleId":8,"authorRole":"a staff member posting for a patient/service user","title":"The staff have been lovely","body":"I arrived into 1 north on Tuesday morning with a suspected heart attack and got a stent put into place.

I have to say that the staff have been phenomenal, they couldn't do enough for you and are extremely approachable.  \r\nI want to mention in particular, the doctors and consultants who come to see me because they are open to any question and will put things into layman's terms. I really feel respected by the staff and am treated with dignity. The hygiene in the ward is good and the cleaners do a thorough job. The food is nice and I am pleased with the selection that is available. The one thing I have remarked on is the benefit of ''being in the system'' as such. As in, being in hospital has enabled me to be checked out for other problems by specialist consultants- for example, consultants in cardiology and rheumatology were on hand to do a full check. Even in terms of tests/scans, which you can receive that day. Whereas, if I was an outpatient, the waiting list could potentially be months.  \r\nThe ward has also been quite liberal with visitors which has really made my time more pleasant as I am able to see my family. Overall, I am delighted with the care I have received in 1 North and want to thank all the staff.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-12-18T12:56:28.4333333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-12-20T12:08:38.12","readBy":[{"name":"Southern Health and Social Care Trust","count":4}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1009301?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1009301"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1009301/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1009301"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1009301/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1009301"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1009301/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1009301"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_32024_320?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"ZT003_32024_320","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/all%20staff?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"all staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/approachable?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"approachable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breathless?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"breathless"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cardiology?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"cardiology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/chest?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"chest"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cleanliness?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"cleanliness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/consultants?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"consultants"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cough?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"cough"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/delighted?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"delighted"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctors?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"doctors"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/rheumatology?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"rheumatology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tests?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"tests"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thoroughness?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"thoroughness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/visiting?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"visiting"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dignity?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Dignity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/explanations?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"explanations"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/questions%20answered?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"questions answered"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/food%20selection?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"food selection"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/phenomenal?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"phenomenal"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1009955?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1009955"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1011014?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1011014"}]},{"id":1009318,"author":"Matdw53","authorRoleId":8,"authorRole":"a staff member posting for a patient/service user","title":"Staff go above and beyond","body":"The care that I have been getting in ramone has honestly been very good and the treatment that I have been given since I was admitted has been absolutely excellent.

could what was a wonderful surgery sink so low","body":"I have been a user of brailsford practice for over 60years it was always a first class doctors until the last couple of years. Then things fell apart I have had many negative experiences in recent times but will just concentrate on today's issue in the hope it will bring about positive change. This morning I called to pick up a repeat prescription and found there were 30 people  waiting to be served as I had to be elsewhere I decided to call later in the afternoon . some five hours on my return there were now 31waiting.over the next hour we move toward slower that snails pace.there were some very unhappy people waiting. I noted that when each in turn reached the head of the queue they were told that their prescription was not even ready and they were given the paperwork to take to a chemist (this has happened to myself on five previous occasions) very occasionally did someone actually walk away with medication. With growing trepidation I reached I reached the head of the queue, and miracle I actually received my medication yes I was lucky this  time, but overall the dispencery service is appalling.

They arrived at our house quickly. He was then quickly taken into the ambulance to be assessed enroute. Thankfully, he became responsive and more alert whilst in the ambulance.  \r\nWe arrived at A&E and he was taken into resus to be closely observed as the A&E staff felt he was too unstable for their general area due to his continued high heart rate, temperature, and recent convulsions.  \r\nOver an hour after being in A&E it was identified that it was best for him to be assessed by a paediatric doctor however there were no beds in paediatric assessment. We waited for a further 2 and half hours to be moved to the Paediatric Assessment Unit. Once there, a Health Care Support Worker took his observations and stated he had a high heart rate (170) and temperature (39.6). It was also noted at this point that the red side of his face was red, swollen and hot to the touch. We requested Paracetamol as he was already overdue having had his first and only one of the day at home a couple of hours before we got to A&E. It took over an hour, and ourselves requesting on a total of 3 occasions, to get Paracetamol for a toddler whose temperature was 39.6 and who was actively rigoring. When the Paracetamol was finally given the nurse handing it to us said that it was only prescribed 25 minutes ago. I would have thought it would be a priority to give him Paracetamol as the reason he was in hospital was due to pyrexia and febrile convulsion. We then got seen by a junior doctor who did a very brief assessment. During the assessment they asked my toddler to open his mouth while they pointed a wooden stick at him. His response was to shut his mouth so they gave up despite me requesting to help. They ended their assessment stating they would report to a more senior doctor their findings and they would formulate a plan.Half an hour later we asked if he would be reviewed soon and were told the doctor was cannulating a patient on the ward and would see us after that. It was also around this time we saw and heard the junior doctor who had reviewed our son talking loudly and with a nurse about another patient.After what had now been a 1 hour wait from anyone last laying eyes on our son, with an ill and tired toddler, and it being near midnight, we decided it would be best to go home and manage his fever at home as his pyrexia was resolving and we could hopefully manage this better with regular Paracetamol at home. When we told the nurses we were going home they said the doctor will be shortly. There is an ill patient being seen currently. We explained our reasons for wanting to go home - that we had been in hospital for just under 6 hours and no test, swab, bloods or anything meaningful had been done except a quick examination by a junior doctor who we felt was incompetent at examining a toddler - and asked what their opinion was from their assessment and they said they had wrote \"query viral infection.\" When we asked how they had decided it was viral and not bacterial without a proper review or any tests at all the senior charge nurse answered that he \"looks viral\" and they were happy for us to go. Adding that if the doctor felt he had needed seen then he would have been seen by now.The next day we took our son to the GP. Within a matter of minutes of laying eyes on our son he diagnosed him with having tonsillitis, and prescribed him antibiotics. He was so apologetic about our experience and said if anyone had carried out a proper assessment, or simply bothered to look in his mouth, it would have been very obvious he had tonsillitis. He stated he had very visible large white spots on both tonsils. The fever, and red, swollen, hot left cheek should have been a clear indicator also. With tonsillitis normally being caused due to Strep-A bacteria which it is being widely reported that many children are currently suffering from this should have been diagnosed much, much earlier. If we had not taken it upon ourselves to go and see the GP the next day our son would have still never received any antibiotics. We are vastly disappointed by his care in the Paediatric Assessment Unit. We feel that the medical and nursing staff should have given far more care and attention to our son. They should be more vigilant of the Strep-A outbreak and realise how detrimental it can be to misdiagnose a bacterial infection as viral on a toddler.","criticality":"moderately

The ambulance staff were absolutely 100%. Everything over in the Royal was ok and they checked me out alright.  \r\nI was then transferred over to Daisy Hill's Male Medical Ward where I am now. It has been dead on here. The only issue was that there had been a miscommunication and they were not aware that I was coming and so I had to wait in the hall whilst a bed became available, which I didn't mind too much. The staff up here have all been absolutely great. I really cannot say a bad word about the staff - they are doing great under immense strain. I couldn't name any staff member over the other as they have all been excellent.  \r\nThe ward itself has been both comfortable and clean.

The room itself is also very nice.  \r\nI have nothing to suggest that needs improving - except maybe a couple of hangers in the wardrobe.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-12-18T15:10:39.3766667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-12-20T13:08:27.527","readBy":[{"name":"Southern Health and Social Care Trust","count":7}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1009329?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1009329"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1009329/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1009329"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1009329/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1009329"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1009329/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1009329"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_33020_420?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"ZT003_33020_420","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cleaning%20staff?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"cleaning staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctors?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"doctors"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dread?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"dread"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/first%20class%20care?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"first class care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lovely?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"lovely"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/low%20mood?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Low mood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/one%20nurse?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"one nurse"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tidy?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"tidy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/great%20nusring%20care?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"great nusring care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/comfortable?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"comfortable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/clean?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"clean"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1010094?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1010094"}]},{"id":1009399,"author":"Tina 237","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Friendly and professional CBT therapist","body":"A GP referred me to Talk Together for support with my anxiety which had led to a relapse of chronic fatigue.

The staff were caring & considerate & made time to explain the situation & what would happen.  \r\nDue to emergencies he was not able to have the operation on Sunday but the reasons were explained by the very busy surgeon. The operation was performed on the Monday & the care in the ward was excellent.  \r\nMy husband was then moved to Ward D26 where the care continued.  \r\nI cannot praise the surgeon, nursing staff & those working on the wards enough.

Throughout the whole procedure from my surgeon Mr Hossain and everyone else involved it was a real eye-opener to receive the highest level of care throughout.  \r\nOnce back in recovery, I received care second to none and of course a long awaited Cup of Tea! In particular, not wishing to exclude anyone, I think Lorraine?

Also I would like to mention Iwona - again care with a constant smile and really looked after me above and beyond.  \r\nMany Thanks to those mentioned and also to everyone else involved from the bottom of my heart!

On arrival I was welcomed and check in rapidly. I only waited 10 minutes and a nurse called me to be examined. She was so kind and gentle and offered me pain relief. While in the waiting area she came and found me and gave me some paracetamol and water. Approximately 15 minutes later I was called for an X-ray. The original nurse called me back to the examination room where she told me my wrist bones were impacted and needed resetting. She said there was a specialist nurse coming to perform manipulation as she could not do this for me. She reassured me that I would be give pain relief. Back in the waiting area for only 20 minutes or so then a lovely Nurse Practitioner called me through to the treatment area. He thoroughly explained the damage to my wrist and what he had to do to put it right.\nHe was assisted by two other nurses while he pulled my impacted wrist bones apart and positioned my wrist in a suitable position. Then he applied a plaster cast. I was given great pain relief during this procedure. He and the other nurses made me laugh and put me at ease. They were all wonderful. I was then referred to fracture clinic which was also run by brilliant staff. I had regular appointments and X-rays. The X-ray department staff were also very kind and professional. My wrist successfully healed. I give thanks to the marvellous staff in the plaster room a brilliant bunch of ladies. My last appointment in fracture clinic I saw a wonderful young doctor who explained the result of my fracture and that one of the bones had shorted as a result of the break he showed great concern and kindness and and reassured me. He said he would arrange physio would see me again in eight weeks. He was marvellous explaining everything and genuinely cared. Less than a week after having my cast removed a lady from Physio phoned to book me in for physio. What fantastic staff their computer system may be tricky but with such amazing staff you wouldn’t know. I start my physio in two weeks. Very grateful thanks to all the staff I was treated by. You are wonderful amazing people.

The response suggests the call is connected and it is then necessary to listen to a long message before connecting to reception, at which stage (every call) I was in was promptly disconnected, despite calling at 8:00am on the dot. Reading others' experiences too, it would seem the current system is not working well in terms of patient experience. If, following repeated attempts to get into a queue (at e.g. no 13), a long wait ensues with no indication there will be no appointments left by the time the call is answered. It is no longer possible to call in person at 8:00am, as the doors open at 8.30am, by which time there are no appointments left. It is like Russian Roulette, as to whether one can connect to a receptionist or not! I believe the current system needs addressing as soon as possible. I have positive experiences of face to face contact with the nurses and GP's and think this aspect lets the surgery down. Given such a positive previous CQC report, it seems  a pity that this aspect, of communication and accessibility lets down what is a great surgery, and when this could be resolved for the benefit of all. The current system seems very difficult for both patients and receptionists, who seem stressed out by it also.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-12-20T08:59:10","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2022-12-20T13:45:31","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1010016?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1010016"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1010016/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1010016"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1010016/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1010016"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1010016/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1010016"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/d81028?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"D81028","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stressed?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"stressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/connected?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"connected"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/face?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"face"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/positive?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"positive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doing%20well?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"doing well"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20great?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"not great"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/like%20myself?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"like myself"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disconnected?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"disconnected"}]},{"id":1010015,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Awful Service","body":"19/12: Joined the car park queue at 7.25am, got to the desk at 0815, no face2face or phone appointments.
