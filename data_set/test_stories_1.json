We were told by 111 we'd speak to a GP however all we got was an obnoxious receptionist speaking to a clinician. They attempted to fob us off and send us to the Bristol Childrens Hospital, despite this not being an emergency. Once we had finally argued our case to see a GP the following day (after turning up at 8am to ensure we got a same day appointment as you can never get through on the phone), we were vindicated by the GP informing us 'The emergency room would not have been appropriate'. We were told to collect a stool sample, handed the tubes by the reception team. However were not informed of sample drop times -' just drop it back to us at the end of the day'. We subsequently missed the collection (we attempted to drop it off at 17:15) and were subsequently told we'd have to take another the next day as collection was at 1645. This was for our 5 month old daughter experiencing gastro issues.

After discussing  symptoms with Receptionist she got me the last one available to see Nurse Practitioner. I had walked down to surgery on off chance for advice. Despite them being very short staffed due to illness ( yes they are human) I was impressed  by the care I was given by Reception. The Nurse Practitioner saw me later that day and after examining me, taking history I was prescribed medication. I was so appreciative - and have a chance of feeling well for Christmas  now. I am on track for follow up if things don't improve. The  Pharmacy work v.hard in a small space- and obtained my medication for me. I have always found this Surgery to be there for me when I need medical help. I understand my part in the process though, and use their online system to order drugs ( in good time to recieve them ) manage symptoms myself ( before requesting  an appointment) and if it was necessary - go to A&E or a walk in centre. Their  online website information  gives good medical advice on simple ailments and what to do in an Emergency.  I feel as a Patient it is my responsibility to understand how the NHS can help me and what is my part in the process. I have witnessed awful behaviour in waiting room from patients towards Receptionists when their demands are unrealistic.\nStaff are doing their job and triage requests appropriately.
