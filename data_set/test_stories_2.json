We had sustained a fall with suspected fractures to upper limbs. We were booked in at reception and seen in a short period of time by the triage Dr and the X-ray department. Upon arriving back at A&E we were immediately directed to the relevant specialists to be given the result of our injuries. My husband sustained a fractured shoulder and was seen by the Dr again and issued with a collar and cuff, pain medication and a telephone appointment scheduled later in the week with the consultant. I saw a specialist nurse for my injuries. The nurse was kind, empathetic and explained how I could manage my  injuries and pain relief. We did not have to wait long to be seen from the time we arrived to going home. It all went smoothly and was very well coordinated.\nWe were then discharged home with follow up letters sent to our home and our GP practice and telephone calls followed from the consultant and physiotherapy service as scheduled.\n We have both made a very good recovery and feel we have been cared for very well.\n\nFrom  walking into A &E the care we have received by the staff has been exemplary and the service seamless from one department to another including all the staff who have attended to us along our recovery journey. We cannot thank the team who saw to us on the afternoon of 26th November ie the receptionists , Dr, Nurse and X-ray staff were brilliant including the follow  up care by the Consultant and physiotherapy team. I am only sorry we cannot name all the staff who were on duty that day  to give them our heartfelt thanks but I hope this review reaches them.\nThank you once again.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2023-01-19T15:47:08","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2023-02-20T06:35:47","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1032230?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1032230"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1032230/responses?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1032230"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1032230/healthservices?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1032230"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1032230/tags?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"1032230"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rgp75?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"RGP75","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20cared%20for?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"not cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20about?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Cared about"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/in%20pain?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"in pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20good?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"not good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain%20relief?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"pain relief"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/physiotherapy?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"physiotherapy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/relief?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"relief"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/shoulder?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"shoulder"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/triage?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"triage"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/well%20cared%20for?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"well cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/x-ray?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"X-ray"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20for?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hope?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"Hope"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doing%20well?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"doing well"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thanks?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"thanks"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/no%20hope?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"no hope"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/injuries?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"injuries"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20well%20cared%20for?key=ht4khutwpp2uzw27fxbx583uq7h8prkyc37x4sw2","id":"very well cared for"}]},
