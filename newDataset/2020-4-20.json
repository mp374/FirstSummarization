Jane also phoned me at home in the evening to ensure I was feeling ok, not in any pain and there wasn’t a problem with my wound, I thought that this was a fabulous example of excellent patient care.  \r\nI will always be so grateful to Jane for her professional skill, her kindness and concern and her lovely, warm personality.

I was searching for a job and he wanted a change of his own job. This is why we attended a job fair at Rotherham Stadium.  \r\nWith not many options to follow I decided to know more about a table that had a big banner with job opportunities for people with medical problems, either physical or mental problems.  \r\nIt was BBO (Building Better Opportunities) run by a quite big team at that job fair. I was assessed by a woman and she explained me about the project requirements and how I will be helped. To be honest, I didn’t understand much of it at that time. She said also I’m not a fit for the programme but she will do something for me instead, to help.  \r\nShe called Alex. “He will be your work coach.” she explained. “He will help you find a suitable job for you according to your skills.” she continued.  \r\nI didn’t know what to expect and what to believe. I only knew that they will help me find a job and I need to attend meetings with them for this to happen. Well, I needed to meet Alex.  \r\nAlex contacted me in about a week. We set up a meeting. We met first in Rotherham and he explained in detailed what will happen. I completed enrolment forms and presented my ID, my passport. I understood more about the project but not completely. It seemed unreal someone will help me search for a job. A job, which was not ordinary or randomly picked but it will be according to my skills, experience and personal needs. I was smiling at the end of our meeting and this filled my heart with hope.  \r\nSince then, I and Alex met every week in a day we both agreed, excepting holidays. We started looking for certain positions I would agree and they were suitable to my skills. We build my CV and cover letters. We started applying. At first I wanted a part-time job and because I was dependent on bus, I couldn’t go further 5 -7 miles from my home, the options were not that many.  \r\nAlex was always calm and never rushed things. He was understanding in any circumstances and wanted for me to get a good job that I will be happy to do it. I learned not only he will help to find me a job but will offer me support for the next 3 months in my new work place to ensure everything is going good for me and I will adapt in, properly.  \r\nEach time we met, I think I began to be more open about me, my job to be and my working needs. I couldn’t think of any job, because I am a person who can’t do a stressful work for long. I couldn’t travel more than 5-7 miles from home because I didn’t have a car or driving licence and my commute with the bus or even train couldn’t be longer than one hour. A long commute and a stressful place to work would have jeopardised my health. I did this before and I had to quit too many jobs. I wanted this to work and I begun to trust more the project, and Alex.  \r\nBefore being part of BBO and meeting Alex, my work coach, I tried customer service roles, 5 times, it was 7 months I resisted the most of it, I was fired because of an absence, then warehouse, I couldn’t cope more than 2 weeks or even self-employed acting as Interpreter it didn’t work, there were too little appointments to interpret for and long distances to cover.  \r\nI think meeting Alex and be part of BBO was my chance here in UK to find the job I was dreaming all this four years I had been here.  \r\nAlex was very receptive to my words, my necessities, my story within work, and the experience, which I consider was little. But, above this I discovered my skills were the most important assets to get me a job I would do it without worrying I wasn’t able to keep it.  \r\nNow I work as a Content Creator. The role is Bank Staff, which offers me a great flexibility, I can work as much time I can without worrying I will be dismissed. And, what is the best part is that I am doing creative work which suits me the most. I love it.  \r\nPreviously I had worked for one year as Graphic Designer in my home country. I was doing banners, flyers, business cards, all sort of promotional stuff. I learned that I enjoyed this job and I developed skills about creating all sort of advertising material. I dared to believe I will do the same work here, in Uk, that I will get a job in graphic design or at least a creative job. I felt was doing well my job at that time and wanted to continue, and even build a career out of it, after moving to Uk. But it was impossible to get that type of job for me without an English certificate/diploma and a portfolio I left in Romania, at my previous employer.  \r\nAlex saw my potential and encouraged me to fulfil my dream, getting a creative job. It was pretty hard as I didn’t have any piece of my previous works. I could not prove my creativity and ability to work with a computer and software to build products, such as flyers, for example.  \r\nHe told every detail I needed to know about the job and asked to collect any evidence of my previous work to be shown to the managers. The job seemed perfect and I didn’t want to miss it. I offered to do a sample of my work instead of evidence of my previous job. He agreed and sent me text and images for the work I did at home. We strongly collaborated about this. The piece of the work he sent it to the right people and I received good feedback. Later, Alex set for me a meeting with a recruitment manager and we met all 3 of us. I did very well and later I was asked to attend another meeting to sign employment papers.  \r\nWe, Alex and I succeeded.  \r\nHe, as work coach was completely successful, he found me a job which was perfectly suitable with flexible working hours, and I could do it even by home or travel to the company. He also respected all my requirements about the job. And I secured a job which was my dream come true. I will do creative work and I know I am good doing it. I will do something I love. Just now, for me it is perfect.  \r\nI hope someday will turn into a great career but this depends only on me, now. I am deeply grateful to Alex for believing in me and making my dream job come true.  \r\nThis was in October. Soon I learned of a great turnout happened in my life. I become ill. I was facing hard times. By that time I needed to meet Alex, sign the employment papers but I couldn’t do it anymore. One day Alex called me and I told him the difficult moments I was living. Alex was a great listener and assured me everything will be fine. We talked for more than an hour, he mostly listened to me.  \r\nMy words are not enough to thank for what he did for me that time. He also assured me the job I had now will be waiting for me.  \r\nThere was a two months break. I feared all our work will be for nothing. But Alex was right, my job waited for me and now I am working.  \r\nI know am at the beginning but I feel that a great work adventure is waiting for me too.  \r\nI am seriously happy.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-04-17T16:16:05.2566667","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2020-04-20T08:25:42.25","readBy":[{"name":"South Yorkshire Housing Association","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/758358","id":"758358"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/758358/responses","id":"758358"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/758358/healthservices","id":"758358"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/758358/tags","id":"758358"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/1-101660555-bbo","id":"1-101660555-BBO","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/encouraged","id":"encouraged"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/encouraging","id":"encouraging"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good","id":"good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helped","id":"helped"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helpful","id":"helpful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/important","id":"important"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/person-centred","id":"person-centred"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/respected","id":"respected"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/the%20change","id":"the change"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/understanding","id":"understanding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing","id":"amazing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/calm","id":"calm"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/great%20listener","id":"great listener"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happy","id":"happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/receptive","id":"receptive"}]},{"id":758369,"author":"AKCNG79","authorRoleId":3,"authorRole":"a parent/guardian","title":"A heartful thank you to all IBD Nurses","body":"Just a little something to say we appreciate all that you do for us as a family and most importantly our son.

","body":"It’s obvious that there are significant knowledge gaps across all roles. Procedurally, not clinically. \nAppointments, in my experience have been easy to gain. If I call for an appointment, I am called back within 2 hours. \nMy biggest gripe, and upon entering the surgery, the subject I see most people complaining about and that is prescriptions. The Practice are ostensibly entirely comfortable with you running short of your medication. \nThey have a banner on their website, committing to a same day turnaround for certain types of medication. However, this simply isn’t followed. The standard 3 day is rarely followed. In addition, their is a refusal to issue medications before the Practice’s deemed due date. This date is the 28th day following your previous prescription, which is for 28 days. Therefore, you have no time allowance to gain your medication. For example; if you are to run out of medication on Tuesday and require a new suite of medication from Wednesday morning, the Surgery issues you a prescription on the Tuesday. It may be late afternoon, early evening. You then have to work with the chemist to get your prescription, which, may require ordering in, taking up to 24 hours. Following which; you have to have the time to get to the chemist to collect your medication which you may be unable to do owing to work or other valid reasons. For example, I have mobility issues and in addition to having to have my medication ordered in, I have to to arrange for someone to collect it on my behalf. Therefore, realistically, I need 3 days, at least. That is; the prescription issuing 3 days, PRIOR to the date I need to take the medication. The Surgery ask for plenty of time to prepare your prescription, in fact, they state at least a week. However, patients are given less than a day, to get the prescription to chemist, medication ordered in, prescription made up and arrange to collect it. Previous reviewers on here have commented about the staff believing they are of greater importance than patients, which is, generally ostensibly the case. This is a perfect example of it. You are often greeted with “look, I’m sorry but we are really busy”. The classic non-apology. It’s as though, their workload is the critical factor, rather than patient care. What’s to say, the patient being admonished by the staff member or GP for not appreciating how busy they are, are not themselves, much busier or under much more pressure. It’s acknowledged that East Grinstead is lacking Primary Care resources per capita. However, it doesn’t mean the GP Surgeries have the monopoly on hard work. \nMy advice to any patients, struggling as I am; don’t stand for it and push back hard when you are spoken to inappropriately. These people are present to serve us. There is no doubting the appreciation felt by the public for the NHS, we treat our NHS workers impeccably, in the main. \nPlease, please, please, sort out the personnel or system causing the delays with prescriptions.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-04-20T08:21:18","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-04-20T09:23:41","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/758469","id":"758469"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/758469/responses","id":"758469"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/758469/healthservices","id":"758469"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/758469/tags","id":"758469"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/h82008","id":"H82008","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/factor%208","id":"factor 8"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mobility","id":"mobility"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appreciation","id":"appreciation"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/758579","id":"758579"}]},{"id":758466,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Amazing treatment","body":"My mum was due to have her surgery at kings college, but due to the coronavirus it was cancelled until further notice.

We phoned the GP for advice. They told us to give more pain relief and it would take a few days to settle. By tea time he was still very hot and we ended having to take him to the GP. I was shocked and frightened in there. No patients, GP covered completely in PPE (rightly so), almost no furniture in the room. It was very hard-hitting. They said he had a cold and was ok so back home we went.  \r\nBy the evening he was still not right. Very listless, his breathing was laboured and faster than normal, he was gurning all the time and I was unable to settle him. It was so unlike him and I was starting to get really concerned. Eventually I phoned 111. Due to his high temp we were put through to the covid lines and they wanted to see him at the covid centre. I was terrified, absolutely panicking myself on that drive to the Victoria - the most horrendous scenarios going through my head. The nurses in the covid centre were fantastic. I was shaking and teary but they reassured me and helped me get a mask on and held my son so I could get organised before we entered the building. They could see I was upset and ‘just got it’. It’s amazing how these little things help so much. We were transferred to the red zone which in itself sounds horrific. Not allowed to drive round we were transported by patient ambulance. I was very scared! The paediatric nurse who met us was a friendly face, albeit gowned up. She told me we’d be ok. She doesn’t know how much I needed to hear that right there. The nurses and doctors we saw were so friendly, kind and reassuring. They really did just get how I was feeling - alone on the ward with a sick child potentially with covid. Not once was anything too much trouble. There was never any drama or stress and they always had time to check on me, which was very much appreciated.  \r\nIt was the worst 24hrs of my life. I’m so glad that there are so many fantastic people working in our NHS. They are putting others before themselves on the front line to help us all. The mask I had on was terribly uncomfy I’ve no idea how they cope all day in it. Not once did anyone shy away from going near my son despite him being possible covid positive. I applaud you all. The nurses Emily, Ellys, and student Erin were just fab. Thank you NHS. Thank you ladies! ❤️  \r\nWe are now home. My son is still not right but Covid negative so that’s a bonus.  \r\nIt was scary, I’m not going to lie but the staff are amazing in what is a difficult time for everyone. The systems at the Vic were very well organised and executed. They are doing their utmost to keep everyone safe.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-04-20T07:57:05.39","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-04-20T10:44:50.157","readBy":[{"name":"NHS 24","count":29},{"name":"NHS Fife","count":13},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2020)","count":1},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2021)","count":1},{"name":"Fife Health & Social Care Partnership","count":4},{"name":"Scottish Government","count":1},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/758459","id":"758459"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/758459/responses","id":"758459"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/758459/healthservices","id":"758459"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/758459/tags","id":"758459"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/f704h_420","id":"F704H_420","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/fifehscp-gps","id":"fifehscp-gps","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/nhs24-111","id":"NHS24-111","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frightened","id":"frightened"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scared","id":"scared"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breathing","id":"breathing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctors","id":"doctors"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kind","id":"kind"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/paediatric","id":"paediatric"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supportive","id":"supportive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/well%20organised","id":"well organised"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassuring","id":"reassuring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid-19","id":"covid-19"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/758481","id":"758481"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/758483","id":"758483"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/758484","id":"758484"}]},{"id":758478,"author":"Dessie","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"My visit after heart attack","body":"After being admitted to the ward I was treated very well.

I started to engage with ORB in January and to begin with, I was a bit reluctant and didn't take it all to serious, but the more and more I attended and the more and more I opened up and started talking it then became a new, healthier coping mechanism and life started becoming more manageable and less lonely.

The midwives on the delivery suite were kind, considerate and supportive and made a difficult journey much easier. What I would say is that as the husband, being in theatre during the caesarean I felt somewhat out of control as little information was given as to what was happening (my wife had some complications that meant both delivery and stitching up after was not straightforward). Given I had severe anxiety about the whole birth process due to my mum passing away delivering me, I would have preferred some more frequent information to understand what was happening and why. It would be said that the consultant who performed the surgery was lovely. After recovery we were taken down to the ward where we felt a little abandoned, especially as first time parents, the staff member who we asked for help made us feel a little inadequate but after that the remainder of the midwives, consultants and maternity support workers were brilliant - checking in on us when they didn’t need to and being very supportive. All but one staff member who came to visit my wife in the very early hours on our second night in regarding concerns over her bowel. The manner was both arrogant and abrupt and greatly upset both myself and my wife, to the point where another staff member ended up coming back into the room to apologise. This person may have expertise and everything may be very simple for them, but to us the situation was both frightening and upsetting - sadly I didn’t get the staff member's name but I feel they really need to revisit the bedside manner element of training! My only other criticism was the lack of catering for me as the husband - I couldn’t go home due to not being allowed back because of the coronavirus concerns and so I had to rely on my wife sharing some with me and a few “handouts” but this should be taken into account as husbands are likely to stay when their partner has had a c section to help and support and due to the lack of sleep etc. we also need to look after ourselves as well by eating well etc. and should not be expected to live out of a vending machine. Other than that the care at Treliske was second to none and we are forever grateful to the midwives, doctors and maternity support workers.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-04-18T12:28:11.8833333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-04-20T11:35:27.377","readBy":[{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2021)","count":1},{"name":"Royal Cornwall Hospitals NHS Trust","count":12},{"name":"Kernow Maternity Voices","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/758418","id":"758418"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/758418/responses","id":"758418"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/758418/healthservices","id":"758418"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/758418/tags","id":"758418"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/ref12_501","id":"REF12_501","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/attention","id":"attention"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bedside%20manner","id":"bedside manner"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bowel","id":"bowel"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/c%20section","id":"c section"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/considerate","id":"considerate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kind","id":"kind"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/maternity","id":"maternity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/midwives","id":"midwives"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/more%20information","id":"more information"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/some%20staff","id":"some staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support%20workers","id":"support workers"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported","id":"supported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/food%20availabilty","id":"food availabilty"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid-19","id":"covid-19"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/758489","id":"758489"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/758499","id":"758499"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/758512","id":"758512"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/758615","id":"758615"}]},{"id":758487,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Many thanks","body":"I was contacted by phone today, 31st March 2020, at 10am for a prearranged phone consultation from the Urology Dept.

So we went to get the letter then went to A& E where they were waiting for me, they give me a mask to wear then took me around the back exit where I had to say goodbye to my husband, again I fully understand why. Then the doctors took bloods and asked me lots of questions and took me for an X-ray after which they put me on a ventilator which helped with my breathing. When my bloods came back the doctor said he was sorry but he would have to take blood from my arteries, which he did then he came back and said sorry again but he needed to redo the test. I wasn't happy as it's very painful but I agreed and he then came back and explained why I was so dizzy and light headed and had no energy.

A carer came out as per procedure and found her in bed vomiting into a bucket. She has long-term GI issues due to radiotherapy for cervical cancer years ago so this is not the first time this has happened. I was called at 4.30 am and asked to make my way to her supported accommodation - the carer said Mum had had two seizures while they were there and that an ambulance had been called.  \r\nWhen I got there the paramedics were there and told me they had witnessed a further seizure and would advise she went to hospital for further investigation of this. Her DNACPR is taped to her fridge as she is adamant that she does not want resuscitating but the paramedics said it was out of date and they couldn't accept it. As I was not allowed in the ambulance to go to hospital with her I found that very distressing and told them so.  \r\nMum then went to hospital - QEUH Glasgow. I waited for a call to ask for some history and let me know where she was. I had to call at 11.30 and go through switchboard and admissions to find out she was in ARU3 and had been since 9am. I phoned there and was told Mum was settled with no further vomiting since admission (which Mum later confirmed was not true). I asked if the reports of seizures had been passed on and the nurse said the bloods had not shown any seizures. I checked the staff knew my Mum was registered blind and said she needed her hearing aids in. I was asked if Mum was a falls risk and I said she had a history of falls and severe osteoporosis well documented in her history. The nurse seemed happy to tell me everything was fine but I felt they did not have all the information i'd asked for with regards to my Mum.  \r\nI got a call later saying Mum was going to 8D in 15 minutes. The nurse said Mum had asked to call me but had informed her to do it upstairs as they have better reception.  \r\nWhen Mum got to 8D she called and told me she had been vomiting frequently since admission and had anti-sickness medication 3 times. She hadn't seen a doctor there yet so I said I would call the ward in the morning.  \r\nI called the ward the following morning and was told Mum still hadn't seen a doctor so I asked if a doctor could call me after she had been seen as I wanted to ask about the seizures.  \r\nMum phoned me about an hour later and said she was being discharged so I called the ward and left a message to say they would need to restart her care package.  \r\n10 minutes later I got a call asking me to come and collect Mum and take her home. I asked how that was supposed to work when family are not allowed in - I said I really wasn't happy about being asked to do that given that I couldn't visit when it mattered most to me! The nurse said they would speak to the charge nurse and then came back and said to meet at the front door. I got another call after that asking me to reinstate the care package which I refused to do as that is part of the hospital discharge responsibility as its not a private contract but a HSCP responsibility.  \r\nI waited 40 minutes outside to pick Mum up and was then asked to go to the door as the nurse would not come to the drop off area.","criticality":"moderately

I then suffered a heart attack followed by cardiac arrest. My wife called the doctor back and he immediately commenced CPR until a defibrillator was in place. My heart was successfully re-started and I was sent to William Harvey Hospital, Ashford, for an emergency operation to have 2 stents inserted. After 2 nights in CCU, I have now returned home and have been told that damage to the heart muscle is likely to be minimal, due to the prompt actions of the Doctor. Although I cannot remember his name, we will never forget his actions and skills. Words cannot express my gratitude, but I would very much appreciate you passing on our entire family's sincere thanks to this Doctor and all of the staff involved.

I would like to take this chance to wish them all the best for the future and once again say thank you.  \r\nTO THE STAFF OF THE GYNO WARD AT CROSSHOUSE HOSPITAL IN KILMARNOCK.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-04-21T17:12:03.4233333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-04-22T08:42:07.22","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Ayrshire & Arran","count":13},{"name":"Office of Joan McAlpine, MSP for South of Scotland","count":1},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/758669","id":"758669"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/758669/responses","id":"758669"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/758669/healthservices","id":"758669"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/758669/tags","id":"758669"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/a111h_502","id":"A111H_502","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/above%20and%20beyond","id":"above and beyond"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cancer","id":"cancer"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cancer%20care","id":"cancer care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/end%20of%20life","id":"end of life"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kindness","id":"kindness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hope","id":"Hope"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported","id":"supported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support%20for%20family","id":"support for family"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/758693","id":"758693"}]},{"id":758681,"author":"Nkx","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Thank you to all involved in the birth of my first baby","body":"I just wanted to write to say thank you to all involved in the birth of my first baby - a little girl.  \r\nI came into triage on the Sunday morning thinking I had gone into labour, however I wasn't too far along, I was given advice and sent off.  \r\nI later had to return as I had a bleed. On arrival I was met by a lovely midwife who kept me calm, and reassured me while working out why I was bleeding. When checked i was 4cm, and my waters were just waiting to be broken, I was told I'd be the next one into labour ward where my partner could join me. (Due to covid 19 he wasn't allowed in until this point)  \r\nIn the labour ward, I was under the care of Margaret who got to know us, and kept us going throughout the whole process. She remained calm when our heart began to dip, and offered an episiotomy to support babies delivery when we knew we had to get her out. Baby was born at half 6, which meant I was then handed over to another member of staff at 7 o'clock. Zoe was great, and really kept us calm when I fainted twice while still under her care, not only did she get me the help I needed but she reassured my husband.  \r\nThese two ladies really did make my experience remain calm and positive despite all that is happening in the world.  \r\nI also want to say a thank you to the ladies in Ashgrove ward, who were fantastic but particularly to Olivia who gave great support throughout in my time there.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-04-22T04:32:25.1366667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-04-22T09:02:20.61","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Grampian","count":3},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/758681","id":"758681"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/758681/responses","id":"758681"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/758681/healthservices","id":"758681"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/758681/tags","id":"758681"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/n161h_501","id":"N161H_501","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/birth","id":"birth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bleeding","id":"bleeding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/calming","id":"calming"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/episiotomy","id":"episiotomy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/labour","id":"labour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lovely","id":"lovely"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/maternity","id":"maternity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/midwife","id":"midwife"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/triage","id":"triage"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/calm","id":"calm"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassuring","id":"reassuring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support%20for%20family","id":"support for family"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/758697","id":"758697"}]},{"id":758694,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"20 years plus fantastic care","body":"I have been attending this clinic for over 25 years and have always received fantastic service.

They also phoned to check that everything was ok on days when there was no scheduled visit.  \r\nAll of this gave us a comforting sense of confidence.  \r\nMany thanks to all concerned.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-04-22T10:21:21.0866667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-04-22T11:57:35.983","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lothian","count":6},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/758700","id":"758700"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/758700/responses","id":"758700"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/758700/healthservices","id":"758700"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/758700/tags","id":"758700"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/s9-midlothian-hath","id":"s9-midlothian-hath","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/advice","id":"advice"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/antibiotics","id":"antibiotics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/assessment","id":"assessment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/caring","id":"caring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cellulitis","id":"cellulitis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/listened","id":"listened"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/oral","id":"oral"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professionalism","id":"professionalism"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confidence","id":"confidence"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wonderful","id":"wonderful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thanks","id":"thanks"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/758761","id":"758761"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/758785","id":"758785"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/758804","id":"758804"}]}]
