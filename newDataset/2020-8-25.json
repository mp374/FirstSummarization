[{"id":781051,"author":"Zanda","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Lack of information","body":"I was recently transported to Lincoln Hospital by Ambulance for what was a suspected heart attack. All was reasonable right up to moving from assessment bay A&E to cubicle in main area of A & E.  \r\nI was taken for an X Ray on wheel chair, but at no time was I asked to sanitise. Luckily for me there was a sink and soap dispenser in the cubicle I was in. A Dr came in and informed me bloods and X Ray were clear. I asked then why did I have this searing pain in the middle of my chest nearly identical to when I suffered a heart attack previously. They informed me the Nurse would come and talk to me with the paperwork. This didn’t happen, I was given tea and toast whilst change of shift happened and then waited until a person entered my cubicle and asked if I was waiting for a lift to which I replied I was waiting to get some information about my diagnosis, get the needle out of my arm and pads from the ECG connections to which they replied that they could take the needle out (still didn’t know who they were) which they did whilst telling me I could have gone home an hour ago, and that a letter would be sent to my GP.  \r\nI phoned for my lift and was shown how to exit the dept and where the toilet was as I left. On entering the toilet, I saw blood on the door and general uncleanliness. Not a satisfactory episode in all fairness as I went home concerned what had happened. I shall be contacting my GP for answers which should have been given on the day.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-08-16T16:12:17.1433333","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2020-08-25T08:41:24.467","readBy":[{"name":"United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust","count":4}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/781051","id":"781051"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/781051/responses","id":"781051"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/781051/healthservices","id":"781051"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/781051/tags","id":"781051"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rwdda_180","id":"RWDDA_180","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood","id":"blood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/chest","id":"chest"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/concerned","id":"concerned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ecg","id":"ecg"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/heart","id":"heart"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/irrelevant","id":"irrelevant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/poor%20cleanliness","id":"poor cleanliness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/toilet%20facilities","id":"toilet facilities"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/x%20ray","id":"x ray"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/previous%20care","id":"previous care"}]},{"id":782331,"author":"cherry86","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"swallowing difficulties","body":"For over a year now i have had issues with swallowing food.

As a family we were delighted with the new facility in our area which would cater for mums needs on a 24hr basis but still allow family to play an active toll in mums every day life .  \r\nUnfortunately Covid 19 had other ideas, around mid March the facility went into voluntary lockdown which we fully supported the manager called by telephone explained it was to insure the safety of all residents. By the end of March government lockdown officially began and mum received a letter stated it would start at the end of July. This date was eagerly awaited on by myself and family And of course mum who with the help of the wonderful staff had been well looked after and more importantly kept virus free . This is where things got complicated, according to manager the facility is still under trust lockdown as higher authority hasn’t been given, measures that he can put in place haven’t been agreed and his hands are tied ! So affectively my 85 year old mum has been under lock down for 6 months with no sign of let up , we are fortunate mums apartment is on ground level we have patio access now , but 6 months family haven’t been able to clean floors , toilets, change beds , wash floors dust !! I’m sure you’re getting the picture, Independent living only works with families who can provide the care , staff are not domestic workers . I want decisions made ASAP my mothers physical and mental health are at a low , we are losing our precious time with her not to dementia but to a system that hasn’t developed the criteria to implement

He went in for a 3 night stay in August. As far as we know he underwent scans and X-ray and no problems were found.  \r\nMy father predominately suffers from Parkinson’s. I am writing as the care and attention he received whilst in hospital was absolutely appalling. He was left in his bed for the majority of his stay. He would try and ask the nurses for several things but would always get ‘just a minute’ response and no one would come back. We were not allowed to speak to him despite ringing several times a day. He was given food not appropriate as he has swallowing difficulty (eg sandwiches) yet on the discharge note they have advised in great detail how his food should be prepared etc. He was only given water to drink.  \r\nPrior to his hospital visit he was able to walk aided by a stick however after no exercise and not eating due to the food provided he was so weak after he returned that he could not even walk. Many a time my mother asked why it took four days to do tests but no one could give an answer. Then finally on the day of his return he left the ward at 715pm but arrived at home at 10pm. It’s only a 20min drive. There were two other patients in the ambulance however these were both walking unaided and were middle aged. These two people were dropped of first but why so long a journey, where were they being dropped of??? Why leave an elderly man to last?? He actually said I’m getting hot here and was met with Oh you’ll be ok by the driver. These two other patients were quite happy chatting and laughing with the driver and other ambulance man.  \r\nI’m just so disappointed that the care was so poor and my father is actually worse now after his visit to hospital.

The following day I received a phone call from Torbay inviting me to attend a clinical assessment at the John Parkes Centre in Torquay. I arrived at the Centre on time and was immediately seen by a Dermatology Specialist.. The examination was thorough and the Specialist advised me that removal of the growth would be arranged a.s.a.p. The Specialist and the assistant Nurse were both kind, courteous and certainly put me at ease. Three days later I was invited to attend the John Parker Centre for treatment where the growth was surgically removed. Once again the Specialists who performed the local anaesthetic and the removal of the growth were kind and caring and I left the Centre feeling extremely relieved that the treatment had been completed successfully and with minimum pain. I would like to offer my sincere thanks to the John Parkes Dermatology team for the kindness and professionalising I received throughout my two visits to the Centre.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-08-23T11:27:32.0466667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-08-25T13:46:50.81","readBy":[{"name":"Torbay and South Devon NHS Foundation Trust","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/782335","id":"782335"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/782335/responses","id":"782335"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/782335/healthservices","id":"782335"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/782335/tags","id":"782335"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/ra901_330","id":"RA901_330","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anaesthetic","id":"Anaesthetic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/courteous","id":"courteous"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dermatology","id":"dermatology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/growth","id":"growth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kind%20staff","id":"kind staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/referral%20time","id":"referral time"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/relieved","id":"relieved"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/timely%20treatment","id":"timely treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20ease","id":"at ease"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thanks","id":"thanks"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/787602","id":"787602"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/787643","id":"787643"}]},{"id":782683,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"super treatment","body":"from arrival to departure I was looked after, everything explained and all questions answered.

I have had many hospital admissions over the past 20 years as I have Lupus, and this admission was a true example of the NHS at its best.  \r\nThank you to everyone, particularly the staff on GLU ward.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-08-23T12:25:20.7966667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-08-25T14:41:34.693","readBy":[{"name":"Royal Cornwall Hospitals NHS Trust","count":8}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/782337","id":"782337"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/782337/responses","id":"782337"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/782337/healthservices","id":"782337"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/782337/tags","id":"782337"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/ref12_180","id":"REF12_180","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/ref12_301","id":"REF12_301","score":5},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/ryf-emergency","id":"RYF-emergency","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/caring","id":"caring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cellulitis","id":"cellulitis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/patient","id":"patient"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thorough","id":"thorough"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassionate","id":"compassionate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/783019","id":"783019"}]},{"id":782375,"author":"Japanese wife","authorRoleId":4,"authorRole":"a relative","title":"Offered words of comfort","body":"Thank you to the staff in MHDU who offered great comfort and care to my dad over the past several years.

I was woken up numerous times during the night for observations (which i understand they have to do) but also at 12:30am by a doctor asking me questions that would be in my notes. Then at 1100am a doctor came to see me and said that they would remove the IV antibiotics and give me it in tablet form, and i would be able to go home that afternoon. I then waited all day untill 4:00pm for my medication, to be able to go home. When it didnt arrive i asked where it was, to be told its been ordered its at the pharmacy, which on a Sunday closes at 5:00pm, it wiuld be here by then. Happy with the explanation i waited. No tablets came. I have a history of severe mental health and take regular medication for, which the staff were well aware off. They then told me I wouldn't get my medication untill Monday morning. After being told all day that i would be going home to being told no your not didn't go too well, i was fuming. I was adamant that i was going home. They did sort it out so i could go home, but caused me to miss a dose of my antibiotic, as they couldn't give me my first dose for Monday morning. I had to get my remaing medication from my GP.  While on that ward i didnt get a choice of food, it was what was left from other wards, which i found disgusting, that we weren't treated the same as any other patient. I felt like i was in an holding pen until they decided what to do with me. Then couldn't fulfill the requirements needed. To be told that your prescription isn't ready because they had a lot to do and yes my surname starts with a \"W\" so i could have been rihht down the list is unacceptable and unprofessional. Nurses were apologetic, but it doesn't give me much confidence in ever using Pinderfields inthe future.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-08-25T11:21:05","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-08-25T14:58:19","readBy":[{"name":"Mid Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/782720","id":"782720"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/782720/responses","id":"782720"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/782720/healthservices","id":"782720"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/782720/tags","id":"782720"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rxf05","id":"RXF05","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/antibiotics","id":"antibiotics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/infection","id":"infection"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/iv%20antibiotics","id":"iv antibiotics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kidney","id":"kidney"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain%20relief","id":"pain relief"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pharmacy","id":"Pharmacy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confidence","id":"confidence"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happy","id":"happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/no%20confidence","id":"no confidence"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/782919","id":"782919"}]},{"id":782372,"author":"Beebopalula","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Bowel repair","body":"I was given a CT scan which revealed a strangled small bowel.

I was informed then that I would probably need to get my gallbladder removed.  \r\nBut after about a week I was sent home. I had a number of recurrent bouts of this pain and was in and out of hospital 4 or 5 times over the next few months. Each time being told yes I needed my gall bladder removed. And was put on the waiting list for surgery.  \r\nIn each visit the staff and all who took care of me were wonderful.I could not have wished for better care and I do think that everyone in the NHS really do go that extra mile for patients. But I never once got a direct answer when I asked how long it would be until I got my surgery.  \r\nEventually I did get a letter of apology because I had not had the surgery within the NHS waiting times. Then I received a letter telling me to go to Perth Royal Infirmary for my surgery in March. I attended and waited. Only to be told by the consultant that I should not have been sent that letter as this was for routine operations only and mine might not be routine. Also he was going on holiday the next day, but would have me on his list for when he returned. but by the time he did get back this whole Covid thing had happened.  \r\nI fully understand the disruption that Covid has caused. And my thoughts and prayers are with all who work in the NHS all through this time. I have phoned a couple of times to ask for information, but just get told that at this time there is nothing they can tell me as my surgery is not urgent.  \r\nHow do I feel about this? Having my life on hold popping pain pills when needed with morphine on standby just in case the pain does get bad enough, and feeling generally unwell for all this time is to say the least depressing. Not just for the effect it is having on me, but on family and friends as well. Basically I just want this over with.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-08-24T10:37:23.5933333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-08-26T09:15:09.697","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Tayside","count":10},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":1},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2020)","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/782392","id":"782392"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/782392/responses","id":"782392"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/782392/healthservices","id":"782392"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/782392/tags","id":"782392"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/t101h_100","id":"T101H_100","score":3},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/t202h-pre-assessment","id":"t202h-pre-assessment","score":3},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confused","id":"confused"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/all%20staff","id":"all staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/antibiotics","id":"antibiotics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/depressed","id":"depressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/forgotten","id":"forgotten"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gall%20bladder","id":"gall bladder"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gallbladder","id":"gallbladder"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gallbladder%20surgery","id":"Gallbladder surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/generally%20unwell","id":"generally unwell"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/information","id":"information"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/morphine","id":"morphine"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wait%20time","id":"wait time"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting%20times","id":"waiting times"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wait%20for%20surgery","id":"wait for surgery"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/782799","id":"782799"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/784299","id":"784299"}]},{"id":782403,"author":"sawlady24","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Haematology appointment","body":"I have a condition where I have to have my blood checked every 4 weeks since having blood poisoning around 4 yrs ago, the haematology dept sent me letters to state that I should not attend the hospital due to Covid-19, they said I would receive a phone call last Thursday.

Today, Friday, i waited for 35 minutes before someone answered and, within 30 secs, put me on hold. Ten minutes later, the call was cut off again!!\nI am now waiting, again, time waiting this time is 19'.36\" and i am now #1 in the call queue - Hooray!!... the doctors are great by the way, and i don't necessarily think it's the fault of the staff -perhaps there just aren't have enough of them. But it cannot excuse what Farnsfield would i'm see as poor performance since they took over the surgery.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-08-21T16:51:37","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-08-26T10:08:48","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/782801","id":"782801"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/782801/responses","id":"782801"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/782801/healthservices","id":"782801"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/782801/tags","id":"782801"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/c84059","id":"C84059","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/786002","id":"786002"}]}]
