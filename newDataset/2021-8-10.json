[{"id":869028,"author":"Blue_25","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Patient confidentiality","body":"I feel upset, embarrassed and very dismissed at bringing up the lack of privacy afforded to me as a day patient in Stobhill Hospital.  \r\nThe nurse who checked me in had obviously not read my notes. The pain relief procedure I was admitted for is directly related to a serious operation and the nurse appeared not to be aware of this. I tried to explain as quietly as possible (through a mask), I felt the nurse didn’t do the same and as the other 3 patients (who were all silent) will have heard.  \r\nTo make matters worse, I’m fairly sure that I knew the patient in the bed beside me, albeit vaguely and not directly. I brought up my distress at being forced to relate my medical history with no privacy. The nurse apologised and said they couldn’t possibly read all my history. I can’t accept this as my procedure is related to a specific issue discussed at a consultation within the last 9 months. This would have been documented in my notes.  \r\nI was offered a feedback form which I declined at that time. The nurse also offered to convey my concerns to the team, however, didn’t offer me the opportunity to speak to the nurse in charge.  \r\nI felt my comments were dismissed, that I was being picky and unreasonable & then the nurse left.  \r\nFor the next 15 minutes I had to endure the staff whispering amongst themselves about the nurse being upset and crying in the corridor. The other patients would also have have been aware of this. When I was being prepared for my procedure the nurse involved was someone else. They were polite and courteous but that’s all. They barely made eye contact. No one asked me if I was ok. I felt like walking out.  \r\nThe procedure and post procedure care was really good. To be fair, the nurse who had prepared me seemed to have thawed a bit by the time I came back to the bay and was more chatty.  \r\nMy discharge was uneventful and I was relieved to be leaving.  \r\nCurtains are not walls and some patients will value privacy more than others. If any discussion involves sensitive information this should be made clear and the offer of privacy made. I know It’s a pain and I’m aware that these spaces are hard to find. It doesn’t take away from the fact that patient care should include the opportunity to speak freely and privately should the situation.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-08-07T16:23:45.74","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-08-10T09:29:35.09","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":6}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/869028","id":"869028"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/869028/responses","id":"869028"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/869028/healthservices","id":"869028"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/869028/tags","id":"869028"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/g207h_191","id":"G207H_191","score":4},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/embarrassed","id":"embarrassed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20upset","id":"very upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dismissed","id":"dismissed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain%20relief","id":"pain relief"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/patient%20privacy","id":"Patient privacy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/some%20staff","id":"some staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nursing%20care%20on%20the%20day","id":"Nursing care on the day"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/the%20procedure","id":"the procedure"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/870343","id":"870343"}]},{"id":869077,"author":"Bella82","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Communication problems","body":"After battling with my mental health, it took a decline recently.

That's the down side - I think it would be good to have 2 attempts at a call rather than have to wait 2 more hours but I'm sure that there are operational reasons for this. And this is not a complaint, but an observation.  \r\nWhen the second call came in late evening from a different doctor she was concerned that I needed to be seen and after a thorough phone consultation she tried to see if I could be seen in the Town clinic. When she phoned back she said it was closing and I wouldn't be able to get there in time so organised a home visit. I thought this was great.  \r\nWhen the visit eventually happened at about 3AM it was a very professional and startlingly alert (for the time of day) nurse practitioner who made a thorough examination got me straight on a regular dosage for paracetamol and ibuprofen (which I'd been completely under dosing hitherto) and gave me clear advice. She was excellent.  \r\nSo thank you to those concerned (sorry didn't catch any names, brain numb) and don't let anyone criticise an excellent service which we should be grateful to have.","criticality":"minimally critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-08-08T13:24:43.2633333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-08-10T09:56:29.467","readBy":[{"name":"Royal Cornwall Hospitals NHS Trust","count":6}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/869113","id":"869113"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/869113/responses","id":"869113"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/869113/healthservices","id":"869113"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/869113/tags","id":"869113"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/ref12-111","id":"ref12-111","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/excellent","id":"excellent"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fever","id":"fever"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurse","id":"nurse"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/on%20call%20doctor","id":"on call doctor"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professionalism","id":"professionalism"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thoroughness","id":"thoroughness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wait%20for%20call%20back","id":"wait for call back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid","id":"covid"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/out%20of%20hours%20doctor","id":"out of hours doctor"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20home","id":"at home"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/870598","id":"870598"}]},{"id":869016,"author":"taurus57","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Hysteroscopy - pain control","body":"My GP suspected I may have womb cancer so organised an appointment at another doctors surgery.

I fell down two steps and was in immense pain, everyone around me was trying to get me back up but I knew I had injured myself really badly so an ambulance was called. I was surprised that the ambulance arrived so quickly. I was so pleased with the lady and gentleman who were looking after me, they made sure immediately that I was comfortable and was receiving pain relief as they too could see how bad my fall was. In the ambulance the staff reassured me and made me feel like I was in safe hands, I was extremely content with the care I was receiving.  \r\nAs my fall happened in Newry, the ambulance was contemplating taking me to Daisy Hill first, but after an evaluation in the ambulance they made the decision to take me straight over to Craigavon as it was believed that an operation was necessary. I am so impressed with how proactive the staff were and their knowledge to make that decision was really beneficial for my treatment.  \r\nWhen I arrived at Craigavon I was admitted through A&E and my experience was actually very pleasant. I was seen very quickly and the staff were so efficient. I felt very informed and knew that staff were going out of their way to ensure that everything was being communicated to me well, and in a way which I was able to understand. After a short wait in A&E and a quick overall examination it was decided that I was going to need an operation, I felt involved in this decision and knew that the doctors were actively listening to my opinion. Before I was taken in for the operation, I met and got chatting to my surgeon. He was a lovely gentleman who made sure to address all my worries and chatted through all my fears with regards to the operation. He reassured me as he chatted through the procedure and made sure I was aware of what the operation would entail. After our discussion I felt that I was left informed and relived that I was in such good hands.  \r\nNow back on the ward to recover I am extremely content with my surroundings. The environment here on this orthopaedics ward is very pleasant and I'm finding it is making my recovery so much easier.  \r\nEverything is so clean and sanitary and I know during the current pandemic era, here I am not at any risk of contracting COVID during my recovery. I am also very relieved to see all the staff kitted out in appropriate PPE and ensuring to sanitize before and after interacting with me. The food is very nice and I am left feeling full and satisfied after any meal I receive. My room is nice and bright, I feel like I'm in a hotel.  \r\nThe staff have communicated everything throughout my recovery so far very well and they have been so accommodating in terms of their communication to me as I need hearing aids to hear properly, but I often forget to charge them so the staff have started to remind me. I have found it really difficult without being able to have any visitors in during my recovery and at times this had made me feel isolated and alone, but the care staff have been brilliant at brightening my mood and have told me about the virtual visiting service offered here which I am planning to start using.  \r\nOne thing I would suggest an improvement on is the hospital beds, I find the mattress very rubbery and uncomfortable especially after my operation when I have been in a good bit of pain. Other than this my experience has been outstanding so just a huge thanks to all the staff who have helped me recover.","criticality":"minimally

staff member posting for a patient/service user","title":"My experience in Craigavon Hospital on the Orthopaedic ward","body":"I have waited 3 weeks for an operation and this has felt like a lifetime. I have been in a lot of pain at home so when I got the phone call to say that my operation would go ahead and there was an available appointment, I felt very relieved. The wait was difficult and this was the most negative part of my experience. I have been in a lot of pain at home and felt very down not knowing when I would get a date for my operation. It was difficult to cope with the pain at home and I think the health system fails people like me during those three weeks of pain. I felt quite abandoned and as if I had to just get on with my discomfort and deal with it.  \r\nI completely understand this is the fault of the health system and its issues of being understaffed and under resourced. I was waiting to get a piece of metal put in my leg and once I arrived in the hospital all of my annoyance and pain was overshadowed as I knew I was in the hands of caring individuals who were going to prioritise helping me get back up on my feet.  \r\nI got a relative to leave me up to the hospital and this was very straightforward. There were no issues with parking etc. I wasn't sure where the orthopaedic ward was so when I arrived in reception I asked the staff there and they were able to direct me. They were all very helpful and welcoming. The staff on the orthopaedic ward have been marvellous. I feel comfortable and rested.  \r\nWhat I would commend the staff the most for would be their communication skills with me and how thorough they have been with their explanations. It is always a daunting experience to undergo a surgical procedure and at least when nursing staff and doctors talk you through everything you feel like you can prepare better for the procedure. I always knew what treatment they were giving me and why they were doing it and this really reassured me and put me at ease before my operation. They answered questions that I had and if they were unsure of an answer they always came back to me. I am extremely impressed with the staff in Craigavon Hospital and would feel very happy to come again knowing how polite and accommodating the staff are.  \r\nOverall my ward space is extremely comfortable. I am lucky that I have been given a side room which is great as I get my own privacy and a TV. The presence of the TV really helps to pass the time. The room is very clean and the toilet and showering facilities are of the same high standard of cleanliness.  \r\nApart from my issues with waiting I have no complaints about the quality of my care in Hospital. It was my first time in Craigavon Hospital and the standard of care has been so good I will be returning here in the future if I ever have another health problem.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-08-08T14:03:51.5066667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-08-10T10:15:12.15","readBy":[{"name":"Southern Health and Social Care Trust","count":5}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/869115","id":"869115"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/869115/responses","id":"869115"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/869115/healthservices","id":"869115"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/869115/tags","id":"869115"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_32024_110","id":"ZT003_32024_110","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cleanliness","id":"cleanliness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good","id":"good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/great","id":"great"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lucky","id":"lucky"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/more%20staff","id":"more staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/operation","id":"operation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/patient%20privacy","id":"Patient privacy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/room","id":"room"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tv","id":"TV"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unsure","id":"unsure"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting%20times","id":"waiting times"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/welcomed","id":"welcomed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happy","id":"happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/impressed","id":"impressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/relieved","id":"relieved"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/time%20for%20questions","id":"time for questions"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20ease","id":"at ease"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20home","id":"at home"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/870287","id":"870287"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/870522","id":"870522"}]},{"id":869105,"author":"JBoy","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Warm and friendly","body":"I was admitted to Surgical Ward 2 after spending a few hours in A&amp;

In particular, I had 2 nurses who looked after me - Daisy during the day shift and another nurse whose name I didn't catch unfortunately (I was a bit dozy following the surgery), but who made sure I was looked after during the night shift. Both were really friendly and approachable and put up with all my questions about what medicines I was taking and what they would do.  \r\nIn addition, I would also like to mention the cleaning staff - the Ward looked spotless and when my room was cleaned on the morning of my discharge, it was done with a friendly smile.  \r\nFinally, a big thank you to Ashleigh who was the theatre nurse with me when I was wheeled into theatre. She did a great job of chatting to me and keeping my mind away from the surgery until I finally went under the anaesthetic.  \r\nEveryone I came across was a credit to the NHS and helped ensure my first (and hopefully last) surgery went smoothly and with minimal anxiety on my part.

Tom changed my life! He listened to me very carefully and identified ways to alter my thought patterns. Tom was so thorough that he even picked up on my moods and the language I used to describe events. Tom used his experience, wisdom and vast amounts of practical advice that helped me evolve within such a short timeframe. He was passionate about his knowledge and motivated me to overcome my obstacles. I didn't expect it to change my life.

I had a fall outside my house and broke my leg. The ambulance crew were very helpful and very knowledgeable. They were able to confirm that I had broken my leg by looking at it and organized for me to get transferred to Craigavon Hospital. They rang the hospital ahead so the staff were able to anticipate my arrival and get me sorted as soon as possible . I was waiting for a couple of hours at the reception but soon got a bed. I didn't really mind the wait as I was satisfied that staff were trying their best to organize a bed for me. I was X- rayed very quickly as well and this sped up the whole process of treatment. I am very happy with how quickly I was seen to which was brilliant as I was in a lot of pain. The staff did however listen to this and gave me adequate pain relief to make me feel comfortable.  \r\nThe staff on this ward have been so good. They are very pleasant and helpful and do everything and more for me. I am due to have my operation tomorrow and they have been helpful and informative with regards to the plans being put in place to allow this procedure to go ahead. I never knew how much needed checked before you can undergo surgery but the staff explained this to me so I haven't felt on edge or anxious.  \r\nI spoke with my surgeon as well and he was very nice to speak to.  \r\nMy ward space is very comfortable and I have no complaints. The level of cleanliness is also of a high standard.  \r\nThe food is good and there is a good variety however there is a lot of it given to you and when you do not have a large appetite there is a lot that goes to waste. It also very salty and this would be my only criticism overall.","criticality":"minimally critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-08-08T14:39:30.7733333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-08-10T11:57:02.06","readBy":[{"name":"Northern Ireland ambulance service","count":3},{"name":"Southern Health and Social Care Trust","count":3},{"name":"Ulster University, MBBS (Medicine) 2021","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/869118","id":"869118"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/869118/responses","id":"869118"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/869118/healthservices","id":"869118"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/869118/tags","id":"869118"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/nias-emergency","id":"nias-emergency","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_32024_110","id":"ZT003_32024_110","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxious","id":"anxious"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/brilliant","id":"brilliant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/broken","id":"broken"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/broken%20leg","id":"broken leg"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cleanliness","id":"cleanliness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fall","id":"fall"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good","id":"good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helpful","id":"helpful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hospital%20staff","id":"Hospital staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/informative","id":"informative"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kind%20staff","id":"kind staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/knowledgeable","id":"knowledgeable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/leg","id":"leg"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/listening","id":"listening"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20good","id":"not good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/operation","id":"operation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain%20relief","id":"pain relief"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/paramedics","id":"paramedics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgeon","id":"surgeon"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20satisfied","id":"very satisfied"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happy","id":"happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/satisfied","id":"satisfied"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/on%20edge","id":"on edge"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/clear%20explanations","id":"clear explanations"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/food%20variety","id":"food variety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20happy","id":"not happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/clean","id":"clean"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/salty%20food","id":"salty food"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/869514","id":"869514"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/869889","id":"869889"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/870289","id":"870289"}]},{"id":869145,"author":"Measles","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Great service following riding accident","body":"My son had a fall from his horse cross country schooling and we couldn't be more impressed by the swift and thorough care he received.

So I opted to get a taxi from Forfar to Perth which cost me £120 there and back.  \r\nAs I am on disability benefits, I got an expenses form and the person I spoke to initially said I should probably get at least half back, but later phoned me to say it was only 13 pence per mile I would get back - I received a payment for £11.00 this week. I feel its riduculous as Perth Royal Infirmary was the only hospital that could do this procedure and to get there has cost me a lot. Could this be looked into as I am sure there a lot of patients who have to travel from Forfar, Arbroath etc to Perth who really cannot afford this and have to wait again.

I was a bit hesitant to go there seeing as I was only used to being treated at North Middlesex Hospital but I was glad I did. The a and e department staff were all amazing. They did their utmost best to relieve my intense pain and anxiety which went on for hours. I kept being reassured and listened to. Even though I was extremely, bordering on impossible, hard to get a line into they did their very best and eventually got a line into my arm. I was later transferred to a ward where I was seen by the pain team and hooked up to a PCA. I was treated with enough pain medication, antibiotics and tlc as much as possible.Even when the pca stopped working because my cannula tissued the doctor made sure I was still being given enough pain relief, antisickness and antibiotics orally and subcutaneously to manage my sickle crisis until they could get another line in me. One time the kitchen accidentally missed me for lunch and one of the care worker, whose name I'm unfortunately not allowed to mention, rapidly offered to get me something to eat from the shop in the hospital with her own money. I mentioned a drink and a snack and she came back with a whole bag worth of snacks and drinks and even a hot food. I was so impressed and touched I almost cried. I couldn't thank her enough. On the day of my discharge the ward manager and other staff  were so attentive to my needs and kept asking if I felt well enough to be discharged and I assured them I was. One of my tta's was missing and they offered to clarify that for me immediately and I could get it the next day which I was okay with.

He waited in a queue for the best part of half an hour, & overheard the couple in front of him complaining to each other that they’d come into the surgery to make an appointment as there were 40 people in the telephone queue (approx 90 min wait) so it was quicker to visit than it was to wait on the phone. When my husband finally got to speak to the person on Reception they looked for the prescription (and even enlisted members of the Prescription team to help) for a considerable time before realising that they had been looking for it under my first name & not my surname. \n\nThis pretty much typifies the problems with this surgery at the moment. I have had a situation recently where I’ve had to bypass the surgery &  self-refer my daughter for physio because her e-consult was triaged by a receptionist NOT a clinician, & she was given a phone appointment for three weeks later for increasing upper back pain (she is 7). A GP then phoned the following day to say that they were having to check how the receptionist had triaged cases, to ensure that those who needed to be spoken to urgently didn’t slip through the net - a massive waste of time and effort! I understand that the practice of receptionist triaging has now been stopped, but it’s pretty alarming that it even started to be honest.\n\nOver the past three or four months I have had:\n\nReception respond to my e-consult by sending me a curt message telling to go & buy my own medication, when I’d specifically spent 20 minutes filling the form in so that I could get it on my prescription prepayment certificate. I then phoned the practice & was told to send an online message to Reception about it, but it was a Thursday & as I got no response on the Friday I was left in pain all weekend without the medication I needed. \n\nI have had a smear cancelled & been told to phone the surgery to rebook when it takes 45 minutes to get through at the quietest time of the day, to then have a 2 min rebooking conversation.\n\nI have been told via a message from the Prescriptions team to buy my own medication over the counter when I had requested my usual repeat prescription of it.\n\nI tried to call the surgery this morning & instead of being put into the queue I was cut off. Three times. I had to phone NHS111 who told the surgery I needed an urgent phone call.\n\nI realise Covid has created many problems, but my parents’ surgery in Derbyshire is efficient & timely, & is everything that Aspen is not. My Dad was a director in a major hospital for a number of years, & he is appalled by the service and standard of care we (& neighbours & friends as well to be honest) have been receiving from Aspen. \n\nI realise that after submitting this review, Aspen Medical Practice will suggest that I put in a complaint via their website.

I believe this Practice joined other local Practices in some sort of merger a couple of years ago and the service is unrecognisable now to what it once was. Most of the old team have left and been replaced by poor substitutes. This used to be a fantastic Practice that the residents and patients of Silsden were proud of, with staff that cared, GP's that were accessible, management that welcomed feedback. They were always willing to listen and engage. Now the residents and patients are treated with disdain when we try to access services and fobbed off. No doubt covid will be blamed but its not. Other Practices I know of have continued to deliver far better services in covid. If there was another local Practice I could join I would, but there isn't. I'm stuck with this shambles.

My start and end times are accurate, all other times are close approximations.\n\nBreakfast finished by 6.30, and on completion of household tasks, I set off for hospital at 9.30 am, arriving at 10.45 to start a long wait in the queue into A&E. I fully appreciate many people had put off long-standing aches and pains during the pandemic, so I expected a delay.\n\nI was registered at ca. 11.30, and then had to wait in the A&E waiting area for a minimum of 1 hour for triage. I was seen in triage at ca. 1.00 pm, and then had to wait again until called forward for examination. At ca. 3.00 pm, a junior doctor found no external signs of concern, but thought the continuing headache warranted a CT scan. I had to wait again to be advised accordingly after she spoke to her superior. \n\nAt ca. 3.20, the doctor took me to the CT scan area (she didn't know her way around, so she asked other staff how to get there). After almost an hour watching other patients being wheeled in and out, I asked a staff member to confirm they had me on their list. They didn't...! I had been transferred to the scan area but not booked in...! They apologised and pledged to get me in straight away. 20 minutes later, I had the scan, lasting approximately 3 minutes, and then returned to A&E at ca. 4.45 pm to await the results.\n\nI had had nothing to eat since 6.30 am.\n\nAt ca. 5.30 pm, I asked the same doctor why the results were taking so long. She said she would look into it. At 6.30 pm, I asked again, and was then guided by another staff member to the CDU waiting area to receive my results. At 6.45 pm, as staff changeover was about to take place, I asked the senior member (before she was about to leave) for an update on my scan results. She simply said, they haven't been sent up yet. \n\nAs new staff took over, I advised reception that I had already spent eight hours in the hospital and that it was now over twelve hours since I had eaten anything. They said they would look into my scan results. At 7.15 pm, I went back to reception and advised them that this whole situation was now ridiculous. Had anyone actually contacted the scan dept at any stage to expedite my results? \n\nAt 7.45 pm, I called for the senior staff member to advise him that having received a 5-minute triage, a 6-minute examination and a 3-minute CT scan, it was inconceivable that I needed to be in the hospital for a total of 9 hours. Over two-and-a-half hours after the scan, there was no sign of the results, nor any urgency in expediting them, so I had no option but to discharge myself. \n\nI got home 12 hours after leaving, and I still do not have the results of my scan...!\n","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2021-08-10T07:47:54","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-08-10T15:41:42","readBy":[{"name":"Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust ","count":1},{"name":"Healthwatch Sheffield","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/869562","id":"869562"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/869562/responses","id":"869562"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/869562/healthservices","id":"869562"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/869562/tags","id":"869562"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rhqng","id":"RHQNG","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/concern","id":"concern"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ct","id":"ct"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ct%20scan","id":"CT scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/head","id":"head"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/headache","id":"headache"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scan","id":"scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/signs","id":"signs"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/triage","id":"triage"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20home","id":"at home"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/869843","id":"869843"}]},{"id":869578,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Terrible Service","body":"Late delivery of medication, almost impossible to contact, do not answer email and unable to contact nursing team.\n\nMy medication was 2 weeks late being delivered.

He was rude not empathic and in my view if he had any queries about the NHS referral to Living Care he should’ve have addressed these in the weeks prior to the appointment with my consultant.

I recall the kindness & care involved.\n\nOn entry the reception was extremely tense, not improved by a nurse arriving with a pair of disposable gloves for me to remove jewellery, It was extremely undignified & intimidating being told that the metal would be ripped from my body by the machine whilst I’m in reception with my dress up, trying to remove it a gold (non-magnetic) belly ring. I wasn’t offered use of changing cubicles until I was taken through! That would have been a more appropriate option.\n\nI struggle with anxiety & panic attacks in enclosed situations & mentioned this to the nurse. This fell upon deaf ears, there was more concern with platinum (not magnetic) ear bars I was having difficulty removing. The radiographers manner was cold, dismissive & you could cut the atmosphere between them with a knife. \nI have learnt that anything not stainless steel can in theory remain if it proves difficult to remove & a magnet can confirm this. He refused to allow a magnet test when the nurse asked twice, just said they’re coming out!\n\nThe radiographer conducting the procedure was extremely brusk, aloof & cold whilst I felt overwhelmed and frightened. The nurse at one point offered me a tissue saying that she could see I was getting upset. He wanted the procedure dealt with as quickly as possible, without empathy. Nothing was explained to me in any detail, any questions I asked were dismissed monosyllabically, it was extremely upsetting.\n\nI asked about the face mask,  it contained a metal wire, I was told that was fine. Only to research later that metal wired masks should not be worn because they can cause burning to the bridge of the nose.  \n\nI asked procedure length & was met with a vague, 20 to 30 minute dismissive answer. At no point was I offered any music to help the situation so the loud machine noise was constant & anxiety making. My kids listened to music during their MRI \n\nThis situation could have been avoided if the team had shown compassion, empathy & understanding. But it seemed to me that they needed to get me in & out as quickly as possible especially as apparently the lady before me was late which had a knock on effect. The radiographer in question was particularly uncaring & unhelpful, maybe this wasn’t helped be me being his last appointment of the day. Even the nurse showing me out apologised to me about everything & said, you probably just want to go as quickly as possible don’t you\n\nWhilst I do understand the concerns regarding jewellery, there is no excuse for insensitivity towards a patient who was feeling anxious & vulnerable. I should not have to walk out of there shaking & in tears, feeling traumatised. It is grossly unacceptable & unfair, especially in a private hospital where patient care is one of the top priorities. That should also include mental well-being I would have thought. \n","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2021-08-10T09:12:07","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-08-10T15:45:39","readBy":[{"name":"BMI Healthcare Ltd","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/869561","id":"869561"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/869561/responses","id":"869561"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/869561/healthservices","id":"869561"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/869561/tags","id":"869561"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/nt401","id":"NT401","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxious","id":"anxious"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/concern","id":"concern"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frightened","id":"frightened"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20listened%20to","id":"not listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20upset","id":"very upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/deaf","id":"deaf"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dismissed","id":"dismissed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ear","id":"ear"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ears","id":"ears"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/face","id":"face"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helped","id":"helped"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mri","id":"mri"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/noise","id":"noise"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nose","id":"nose"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/overwhelmed","id":"overwhelmed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/panic","id":"panic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/test","id":"test"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/traumatised","id":"traumatised"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vulnerable","id":"vulnerable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fine","id":"fine"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/869683","id":"869683"}]},{"id":869559,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Wonderful, supportive treatment","body":"I attended the Royal Surrey as an outpatient for a gynaecological procedure - hysteroscopy. The door staff and others who saw me trying to figure out where to go were proactive and helpful. When I went in for my treatment the doctor and nurses were fantastic. They warmly welcomed me which makes a difference in boosting confidence about a procedure I was worried about. The doctor asks questions, listened actively and explained what he could do and what options were. We agreed to go forward. Heaps of support from him and the nurses throughout the procedure - telling me I was doing well, was being brave, and to breathe. Those things make a big difference. The doctor explained what he was doing and gave me the option as to whether or not to remove a polyp he found. I said yes as I knew the team would help me get through it. Afterwards I was given time to gain my composure - no rush. The doctor explained and showed me pictures of everything. As unpleasant as the procedure was the experience was VERY pleasant.

The advice was to book through the NHS app which is wrongly named on the interminable message played over and over again when you are holding on, there are never any next day appts on this app or go to walk in centre and spend another couple of hours waiting or queue outside the surgery at 8am. The last time I did this I had to queue from 7am in order to get an appointment. However if you do manage to get an appointment I have found the service to be very good and the reception staff helpful. It is very disappointing as I have been a patient for nearly 30 years and this used to be an excellent practice. I understand that years of underfunding had taken their toll even before Covid, but you must be able to do better than this. It is causing so much stress.

Sometimes good sometime pretty…","body":"Like many, I have been a patient at Elizabeth Avenue since the early 2000s. \n\nDuring the past 20 years, there has been a general problem with the receptionists who could all do with regular refresher training in general civility. Yes, we are aware there is a pandemic and everyone (including patients) are working long, extra hours, so the receptionists may be under additional strain, but this does NOT excuse attitude, impatience and rudeness. It is simply unprofessional and counterproductive. It's NEVER OK or defensible. Manner (and manners) are important, as are receptiveness in a receptionist. It's a basic requirement of the role -- otherwise, get a job on a building site where such things matter less. \n\nThe doctors and nursing staff are generally pleasant and accommodating and respond well to a bit of jollity and good tempered banter. I have managed to get jabs and referrals for key ailments over the years, but the Covid situation has seemingly rendered the surgery largely incapable of providing anything other than basic support. Despite 3-4 calls and conversations over the past year, I have yet to receive attention for a disorder which has seriously diminished my quality of life. The intervention of the same doctor over 6 months resulted in absolutely nothing, despite promises to the contrary. No follow-up calls or explanations have been received, so I guess I just have to continue to endure the problem or go privately, which is upsetting and disappointing.\n\nI've always been a massive supporter of the NHS and greatly appreciative of medical care this country has to offer, but if this is the 'new normal', then I am glad to be in the autumn of my life. I feel certain the current government has no genuine desire to help support an institution which was founded by (and is inherently linked to) welfare state principles espoused by their political opposites. Headline £spending figures and glib 3-word slogans do not a healthcare policy make. Sad times ahead for Brexit Britain, and our medical services will suffer like everything else.

I tried to contact the unit a number of times no one would answer the phone at all, I called the number on the prescription which was the UHL Parmacy Dept she informed me that the prescription had been badly filled out and I needed to contact them, in desperation I contacted PILs who were very helpful but also unable to contact the Unit eventually some seven hours later I managed to make contact with the person who issued the prescription who denied that the drug was unobtainable and advised me to contact my GP as he may be able to prescribe an alternative this was late on Friday afternoon so I could not contact my GP until Monday morning, despite being told by the hospital pharmacist I needed the drug on Thursday the day of issue. I contacted my GP on Monday to be told that this medication was only a trial (I was not informed of this at the time of issue) and advised me not to have it until further tests were carried out this is now being undertaken by my GP.
