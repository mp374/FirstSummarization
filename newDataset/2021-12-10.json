Every single time I call up the surgery for whatever reason the service is less than satisfactory. Previously I was promised a telephone appointment that never happened and when challenged the man on reception explained that whilst he had promised me a telephone appointment, after the call his manager advised him that this was not possible however he did not think it was necessary to call back and explain this to me, instead I was just left waiting for the call and having to call up to find out why I never got it.

She was very dismissive, did not ask what the problem was, suggested I could not have had previously prescribed medication without seeing a doctor. She went on to say that the first available appt. I could have would be 5 days later, again as I am well aware of my ongoing condition, I said that would leave my 5 days in pain and then possibly 2 more days before any medication would take effect. She then suggested I could see a doctor the following day! I found her manner totally unacceptable and borderline rude. I do hope calls are monitored, as this member of staff could certainly do with some extra training on how to deal with a distressed customer. I was left feeling humiliated, let down and most of all upset and angry, all of which could have been avoided by a more caring, professional individual. To end on a more positive note, the doctor I did see was exceptional, in these difficult and demanding times for all, she made time to listen and was supportive about my feelings concerning the receptionist I had the misfortune to deal with.

I had preeclampsia which led to me being induced and ultimately an emergency section. Micah also had some jaundice which led to quite a long stay. I'd like to say how much I appreciate all the care and support I received at the maternity ward. I can't remember all of the names but in particular I'd like to thank the midwives in 2 West who looked after us - Rachael, Cherry, Cherith, Ashleigh and others who were so helpful. I'd also like to thank all the domestic staff who kept us fed and watered and were always so kind and attentive. The nurses were also so helpful supportive and attentive during our stay. In the delivery suite, things got pretty stressful but the care we received was second to none - Dr Khan did an amazing job in keeping us informed, communicating the available options and giving me back control by asking me what I wanted - I appreciated that so much. I'd also like to single out Ann who looked after me all day after induction, and Orla and Fionnula who were there for us all night and through to the morning after my son was born. I was pretty out of it so can't remember everything you did for us but I know you ensured that our baby was delivered safely and I'm so grateful to you.

I did an initial Econsult which was very thorough although I did find it a little frustrating as the questions seemed to be repeating themselves however I got a call shortly after asking if I would prefer a call am or pm the next working day which was great. On the day of the call I received a text saying systems were down and it would have to be rescheduled. at which point more than a few choice words were screamed due to sheer frustration however within a couple of hours I did receive the call from a very nice doctor which was a little shock as website still reported much later in the day that systems were down and given a prescription and told to get back in touch if it didn’t work. It worked somewhat so I did another E-Consult this time I just got an email saying someone would be in touch by 6.30 the next working day, this didn’t happen so there’s a part on the email you can send a response saying you haven’t contacted me so it’s now approaching 6.30 two days after the second e-consult and still no contact. I’m loathe to try and call them in case they try and contact me while I’m trying to get hold of them but nevertheless tried a couple of times with no success. I really am at my wits end now I don’t believe they have any intention of contacting me I feel totally let down. I appreciate how busy they must be but I feel invisible to them I know from my partners recent experience at the surgery if you do mange to get in there is hardly anyone in there so what exactly they are doing is still a mystery.

She seemed fine. When early the next morning (3am) she started vomiting I called 111. I spoke with a fantastic call handler called Chris who was calm, friendly and put me at ease. He spoke with a nurse and the decision was made to send us to UHW ED. My daughter was very quickly triaged by a lovely nurse Janice and then seen quickly by Dr Patrick. It was busy but they saw her quickly. It was decided that a CT scan was required. This showed potential inflammation/infection to the bone behind her ear. Not related to the head injury. Within hours we were seen by Dr Nick from UHM Monklands ENT dept. She was admitted to the paediatric ward for 24hrs abx and obs. The next morning we had a ENT consultation with Dr Iyers. She was discharged home with follow up meds and OP appointment. Seamless care.  \r\nFrom start to finish her care was exceptional. From Chris the call handler, ED Dr Patrick, Dr Val, Dr David, ED nursed Janice, Nicola M, Mark, ENT consutants Dr Nick and Dr Arun, Ward 19 Dr David, Nurse Eleanor, Ward 20 nightshift nurse Ashley(this nurse was an angel and never stopped the whole night), Nurse Megan and even the domestic on ward 20 had the loveliest way with the children.  \r\nBoth ED and ward 20 were extremely busy but we never felt like a bother. All staff introduced themselves, spoke directly to my young daughter and treated both us and her with kindness and respect.  \r\nIt's easy to see the negatives in current times but all we witnessed was kindness and positivity from very hard worked staff.  \r\nThese members of staff deserve nothing but praise and Thank you just does not seem enough.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-12-08T19:18:58.88","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-12-10T11:49:45.507","readBy":[{"name":"NHS 24","count":24},{"name":"NHS Lanarkshire","count":14}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/901354","id":"901354"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/901354/responses","id":"901354"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/901354/healthservices","id":"901354"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/901354/tags","id":"901354"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l106h_120","id":"L106H_120","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l308h_180","id":"L308H_180","score":5},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l308h_420","id":"L308H_420","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/nhs24-111","id":"NHS24-111","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/call%20handler","id":"call handler"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ed","id":"ed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/efficient","id":"efficient"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ent","id":"ent"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/excellent%20care","id":"excellent care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nhs%20111%20staff","id":"NHS 111 staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/paediatric","id":"paediatric"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/safe","id":"safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20for","id":"cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/domestics","id":"domestics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/a&e%20triage","id":"A&E triage"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/901727","id":"901727"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/901747","id":"901747"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/901757","id":"901757"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/901758","id":"901758"}]},{"id":901689,"author":"Rs19","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Peterhead community maternity unit","body":"I gave birth in the Peterhead Maternity unit last month and honestly can't praise all of the staff enough.

I am a first time mum and was pretty clueless when it came to it all and all of the midwives were so reassuring and able to advise me on all of the questions I had. The midwives were so supportive during my labour and really helped me through especially with my husbands little incident. (Which makes a great story now ha)  \r\nThere was a student midwife working and you would never have thought she was a student, she was very great and able to answer all of my questions. I was in overnight in the hospital and again the care we both received was great inckuding support to breast feed. After I was home again the support was great, I had regular visits from various midwifes who were very supportive and able to help me with feeding and questions I had. If you have any doubts about going to a midwife led unit please don't they are fantastic! Thank you all so much again!","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-12-10T08:37:22.12","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-12-10T11:50:46.697","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Grampian","count":4}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/901689","id":"901689"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/901689/responses","id":"901689"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/901689/healthservices","id":"901689"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/901689/tags","id":"901689"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/n333h_501","id":"N333H_501","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/giving%20birth","id":"giving birth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kind","id":"kind"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/knowledgeable","id":"knowledgeable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/maternity","id":"maternity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/midwives","id":"midwives"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supportive","id":"supportive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassuring","id":"reassuring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/relaxed","id":"relaxed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported","id":"supported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good%20staff","id":"good staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/clean","id":"clean"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/903917","id":"903917"}]},{"id":901355,"author":"MoniqueLP","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Great service from Dr","body":"After having been to another surgery to try and get my contraceptive implant removed twice (which the GP had struggled to remove), I was then referred to the Lawson Practice. \r\n\r\nDr Shabana was polite, welcoming and made me feel at ease.

This was initially over the phone but Dr Box was keen to see me in person and got me in the next day. He really took my situation seriously and I felt heard. He organised additional investigations immediately. I made a 2nd appointment as symptoms got worse and saw Dr Singupta who has been looking after me now for 3 months. As with Dr Box, he listens, is attentive and it feels like he has been doing everything he can to investigate my symptoms as well as manage them. We're not at the bottom of my situation yet but I feel strongly that the care and dedication shown by the GPs including their wider healthcare and supportive admin team really need to be recognised for their excellent care.  \r\nDr Singupta has followed me up regularly via the phone or in person if he or I feel it necessary and has made swift referrals for investigations and to include other specialties. His calm and caring manner and the time he takes are to be commended.  \r\n2020/21 have been tough for most of us and for healthcare workers to be facing the same personal challenges and dilemmas as the wider population while still working to so diligently demonstrates such high standards of professionalism and humility.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-12-09T09:42:09.14","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-12-10T12:05:42.403","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lothian","count":5},{"name":"Office of Foysol Choudhury, MSP for North Edinburgh, Leith, Edinburgh Western & West Lothian","count":1},{"name":"Scottish Government","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/901445","id":"901445"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/901445/responses","id":"901445"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/901445/healthservices","id":"901445"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/901445/tags","id":"901445"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/ss9-general-practices","id":"SS9-general-practices","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20sample","id":"blood sample"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ct%20scan","id":"CT scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dizzyness","id":"dizzyness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/empathy","id":"empathy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/headaches","id":"headaches"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/humility","id":"humility"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/listen","id":"listen"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/monitoring","id":"monitoring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/my%20gp","id":"My GP"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professionalism","id":"professionalism"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/calm","id":"calm"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/early%20investigation","id":"early investigation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diligent","id":"diligent"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/903587","id":"903587"}]},{"id":901480,"author":"hoodie","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"My reiki sessions","body":"Having the peaceful time to be myself, to share my feelings, whatever they may have been, without fear or judgement in anyway. \r\nMy feelings changed from one visit to the next, and at no time did I ever feel there was every any fear of expressing that feeling and what a relief it was to unburden, and share something valuable. \r\nThere are many ways of reiki so Craig explained, sometimes we just talked on, I did!

The hospital has removed their advocacy service so people with conditions like dementia really have no voice or help once they get sucked into this broken machine. A complete lack of oversight and general breakdown in communication means that finding out how a loved one is becomes a quest of unimaginable frustration, and contradiction.  \r\nThe only positive experience in all of this has been the virtual visiting service which allows family to actually see for themselves how their loved one is. It made a huge difference for my mum and for her family. We were able to reassure her that she hadn't been abandoned, that she is loved, and we can do this everyday now.
