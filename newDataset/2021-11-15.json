She was admitted to hospital after antibiotics at home failed to cure her kidney infection and her situation had worsened by not eating and drinking. After issues with her gp, she eventually started getting treatment from the hospital at home team. They came out and assessed her and were excellent. They arranged her to be admitted to forth valley hospital as she was so dehydrated they were concerned she had sepsis.  \r\nShe was moved to AAU3 where an exceptional student nurse called Francie gave her fantastic care and attention. At home I had been trying to get my mum to drink and eat and had only managed small amounts of trifle. When I visited I had some trifle and spoon fed my mum a small amount and had managed to get her to take some water. Francie had came in as I was playing music to my mum.  \r\nThe next day when I phoned it was Francie who answered. She had been caring for my mum and had got her to eat a full yoghurt and take a cup of tea which was amazing! She had also put music on for her similar to what I had played the night before she also provided a full update of my mum's status and condition.  \r\nBy the time I went to visit in the evening Francie had managed to get my mum to eat a full bowl of soup and some more tea.  \r\nI have been informed Francie is due to qualify in a few weeks. I understand health care staff have a duty to make sure patients eat and drink but Francie had really paid attention to my mum and the music she put on was not necessary but it's these little things that make all the difference especially for a dementia patient.  \r\nI am so pleased Francie was there with my mum and the relief it gives a family member especially ones who's a carer is overwhelming.  \r\nMy big thanks to Francie and the team in Forth Valley Acute Assessment Unit (AAU and AAU3) and Carla from the Frailty Team for taking great care of my mum and going that extra mile to make her stay more comfortable","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-11-12T17:00:05.1966667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-11-15T09:12:29.133","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Forth Valley","count":10},{"name":"Scottish Government","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/895358","id":"895358"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/895358/responses","id":"895358"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/895358/healthservices","id":"895358"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/895358/tags","id":"895358"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/forth-valley-royal-aau","id":"forth-valley-royal-aau","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/forth-valley-royal-older","id":"forth-valley-royal-older","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/alzheimer's","id":"alzheimer's"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care%20&%20attention","id":"Care & attention"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dehydrated","id":"dehydrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dementia","id":"dementia"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/drinking","id":"drinking"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/in%20good%20hands","id":"in good hands"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/infection","id":"infection"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kidney","id":"kidney"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/person-centred","id":"person-centred"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/student%20nurse","id":"student nurse"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/relieved","id":"relieved"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/trust","id":"Trust"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/exceptional%20staff","id":"exceptional staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kept%20updated","id":"kept updated"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/896369","id":"896369"}]},{"id":892061,"author":"thomasmc007","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"anti biotics causing harm","body":"I recently got prescribed anti biotics for an ear infection which cleared my infection up ,however 3 days later, infection came back.

I have had blood pressure problems for more than 15 years. Since the beginning of the pandemic, I have not been able to be consulted by a GP at the treatment of blood pressure or physically consulted in this matter. I have asked many times to be sent to a cardiologist and to have a proper consultation done by a cardiologist doctor, when it about hypertension.  \r\nI received countless refusals to be consulted by at least one doctor from the GP. Unfortunately, my problems with hypertension continue. And the GPs are constantly changing the treatment over the phone. It's very frustrating for me to get here. You can only be consulted by a doctor by phone. Which is an aberration. It is against everything I have learned and I know it is done by a doctor.  \r\nIn the last month, I called countless times and prayed, I begged to be consulted by a doctor, not by phone. In the end, they made an appointment with a doctor from the GP. I also received the phone message reminding me not to forget about the appointment with that doctor.  \r\nI went there at the appointed time. I was invited to the office by the doctor. But the doctor came out and I stayed with the nurse. I thought that nurse would take my blood pressure and then the doctor would come back to talk to you.  \r\nBut, to my surprise, the nurse did not take my blood pressure, instead she started asking me:  \r\n1. How do I feel?  \r\n2. What if I have an allergy to something?  \r\nAt that moment, I became very careful and asked what these questions were for?  \r\nThe very serene and confident nurse told me that I will receive the flu vaccine and the one for Covid !(I wanna mention here that I had my Covid Vaccine in July 2021)  \r\nMy dear readers, the next second I got up from my chair and asked to call the doctor to give me an explanation.  \r\nThe doctor came, but he was very indignant at the refusal of the vaccines.  \r\nI answered like this:  \r\nI came here to the clinic today because I have a consultation with my doctor for my hypertension and to talk about treatment.  \r\nVery intrigued because I refused any vaccine, the doctor told me that I was not called for consultation, but I was scheduled for vaccination. He finally gave me a prescription by which he doubled one of the pills for hypertension, with a very short explanation, after which I was invited out of the office.  \r\nMy dear readers, we live in times we have never lived in our lives.  \r\nThe conclusion of my story:  \r\nThe best doctor is only yourself.  \r\nDo not have any expectations from anyone but you.  \r\nLondon 2021, taxpayer, to no longer be able to be consulted by a doctor physical and mental, only to hear him on the phone.  \r\nScience fiction movie script ???  \r\nUnfortunately no, it's a reality.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-11-08T17:10:17.1133333","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2021-11-15T09:20:04.37","readBy":[],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/894110","id":"894110"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/894110/responses","id":"894110"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/894110/healthservices","id":"894110"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/894110/tags","id":"894110"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/f85065","id":"F85065","score":1},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/access%20to%20gp","id":"access to GP"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20pressure","id":"blood pressure"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hypertension","id":"hypertension"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurse","id":"nurse"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/phone%20consultation","id":"phone consultation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/prescription","id":"Prescription"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/remote%20treatment","id":"Remote treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gp%20services","id":"gp services"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vaccines","id":"vaccines"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/access%20to%20face%20to%20face","id":"access to face to face"}]},{"id":894728,"author":"lizsh36","authorRoleId":4,"authorRole":"a relative","title":"My son wants to go home","body":"My son has autism and was diagnosed by a specialist with aspergers in 2020.  \r\nHe was arrested in February 2021, not released on bail, but sent to a mental health unit in Darlington, then Hartington Unit in Derbyshire, and the police did not notify me as I was looking for my son.  \r\nMy son is now in the Radbourne Unit in Derby.

Surely not! Please God that cannot have happened to our beloved good natured mother who has never a cross word for anyone.  \r\nTo be honest we were screaming for her to wake up as we tried to bring her round not knowing if she was dead or had just knocked herself out.  \r\nSo after about 15 seconds she came round completely dazed. But all we could think was that she was still alive. Thank God above.  \r\nWe phoned the ambulance and our neighbour and retired family doctor came in to assess the situation to reassure us and mum.  \r\nThe ambulance arrived and I went with her to A&E in Antrim hospital. Once she was assessed there, her brutal injuries were revealed to me by the IC doctor Ceril.  \r\nHis absolute concern for her was overwhelming to me and I will never forget his kindness.  \r\nMum had a deep cut in her forehead needing 7 stitches, a bleed on the brain, broken nose, shattered eye socket and disastrously a broken neck.  \r\nCeril handed her over to Gary in IC to continue urgent care along with his staff and between them and colleagues in the Royal Victoria we took a second ambulance to Belfast in the early hours of the morning as her face and head turned black and blue with bruising.  \r\nWithin less than 24 hours mum was admitted to Major Trauma. Her progress in the first week was surprising but maybe and who knows shock took a hold of her and she became very ill. By the following Tuesday before I had even written her surname in the visitors book a doctor was behind me to give me the update on her, which had no future.  \r\nBut you see I nor my family could give up on her. Once I had gathered myself and spoke to my siblings , yes we agreed should her heart stop she should not be resuscitated, but I pleaded with the doctors that they did not know her as we did and her care should continue as if she would recover. I understand doctors are realists but we have an amazing prayer circle , the pain for us was how could mum leave this world with so many injuries , why could she not have just had peace which she deserves and slept away.  \r\nSo the fight began from everywhere and everyone including her. Her phone call to me the first week continued to ring in my ears.  \r\nFrom the intense care and kindnesses of Major Trauma to the pressure madness of Ward4D, constant phone calls for updates from hierarchy in the system to nurses on the ground we never stopped.  \r\nThis was a frantic time for us because we could see how frantic the workload is for the staff in that ward. We worried that a ninety year old would get lost.  \r\nFour weeks later mum was admitted to Whiteabbey Acute Fracture rehabilitation.  \r\nFive weeks later after a time of three very difficult conversations with doctors in each of these wards of care to their astonishment mum has pulled through. The medicine and treatments have worked , the ‘Care’ on its own , ‘ What can I say?’ It was and is the care she has received from nursing. The doctors , nurses , assistants. Dieticians, Ambulance drivers , X-ray, that brought her to this stage of recovery.  \r\nThe staff I spoke to **doctors** Ceril , Gary , Antrim .  \r\n**Royal Victoria Hospital **  \r\nElise, Agor, Peter, Megan Doctors,  \r\nColm consultant Major trauma,  \r\nNurses Megan , Rebecca  \r\nKay  \r\n**Dietitian** Julie  \r\nKathryn ; Mr Verzin’s secretary  \r\nJanet, registrar  \r\n**Doctors **

His leg was checked over and no fracture or break ,they kept him in over the weekend for some physio and to see ot, I got to see dad on a Sunday afternoon, he didn't look well and had a crackle in his chest despite numerous phone calls from myself to say he can't lie flat due to his Parkinson's and can't breathe properly.  \r\nI called that night to be asked to speak to a doctor who asked me to come up straight away, They suspected a stroke and was going to treat for seizures to which I explained it was tremors due to Parkinson's, they commenced on a drip for fluids, antibiotic and glucose levels they stated over his bed they would treat him medically and it was basically his Parkinson's. They said he was confused and had incapacity which is untrue, he was refused drinks overnight which I complained about every visit, was being put in his notes and on the board above his bed. My dad tested positive on the day he was sent home, nothing on his patient notes to state covid. My dad was sent home for palliative care having been a man who walked with a zimmer, made his meals to someone double incontinent , unable to walk or talk and problems urinating because they also caused trauma trying to catheterize him when he had an enlarged prostate.  \r\nI received him home at 7.30pm on a Friday night with no continence aids. If it wasn't for the help of the care provider we would have had nothing.

We are part of the Small steps Big changes organisation. When i expressed my consern to the SSBC, my daughters family mentor sent out a home talk leaflet. Immediately I did a referral online and was contacted the very same day by email by a very pleasant gentleman who explained someone from hometalk will be in contact via phone in the coming week. 2 days later a lovely lady contacted me and explained in great detail what home talk was about, how it will benefit myself and my daughter and who I would be assigned to. The following week I was contacted by my speech therapist called Hazel. From our first conversation I was absolutely impressed. Hazel was so professional as well as friendly and I felt as if I could express my concerns to Hazel without any hesitation. From the very first visit I knew instantly that Hazel would help my daughter start to talk. From the first visit my daughter picked up new words from Hazel. Hazel talked me through the stages of children communicating and understanding, and this helped me understand why some children have a delay in speech. Our 6 visits consisted of multiple different activities including making play dough, books, bag activities, different accessories to label. I was completely impressed. Hazel also gave me several tips and tricks to help my daughter. Building up to the last few visits I, and several other family members had noticed a huge difference in my daughters speech. From only saying 5-8 words she was now saying about 30/40 words and had started saying about 20/25 words independently. I wholeheartedly cannot thank Hazel enough. She is absolutely phenomenal. I truly believe home talk as a whole organisation has helped myself as well as many other parents with delayed speech of their children. This service would benefit a lot more parents and children if it were available in all areas as it has helped me. I cannot express enough that if it wasn't for home talk my daughter would still be struggling with her speech.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-11-12T22:50:34.64","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-11-15T14:25:56.643","readBy":[{"name":"Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust","count":4},{"name":"Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists (RCSLT)","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/895410","id":"895410"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/895410/responses","id":"895410"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/895410/healthservices","id":"895410"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/895410/tags","id":"895410"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rha20-cyp-speech","id":"rha20-cyp-speech","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/more%20funding","id":"More funding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professional","id":"professional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/quick%20response","id":"quick response"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/speech","id":"speech"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/speech%20therapist","id":"speech therapist"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/understanding","id":"understanding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wider%20availability","id":"wider availability"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fantastic","id":"fantastic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20ease","id":"at ease"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/phenomenal","id":"phenomenal"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/901847","id":"901847"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/903515","id":"903515"}]},{"id":895807,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Caring, attentive, professional ","body":"During my recent illness I felt very cared for by GPs and nurses alike.

Throughout waiting, triage, and treatment, all members of staff were incredibly attentive and knowledgeable and really helped my child feel calm and relaxed throughout a very stressful situation. My child needed to visit the hospital, but could only do this through the ambulance service as she required a constant supply of oxygen. An ambulance could not attend the walk in centre until over 12 hours after we arrived for a diagnosis, meaning staff had to stay with us once the centre had closed until the early hours of the morning to keep my daughter on oxygen. Throughout this, each member of staff was incredibly kind and reassuring, providing her with an outstanding level of care and support, not once complaining even though they were all still in work hours and hours after their shifts should have finished.

I am so grateful and thankful for the care my child received from all of the staff at Halewood walk in centre.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-11-13T00:38:37.6766667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-11-15T14:42:29.523","readBy":[{"name":"North West Boroughs Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust","count":2},{"name":"Mersey Care NHS Trust","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/895412","id":"895412"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/895412/responses","id":"895412"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/895412/healthservices","id":"895412"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/895412/tags","id":"895412"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/kips-halewood-wic","id":"kips-halewood-wic","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/asthma","id":"asthma"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/attentive%20staff","id":"Attentive Staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diagnosis","id":"diagnosis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/exceptional%20care","id":"Exceptional care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/knowledgeable%20staff","id":"Knowledgeable Staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/the%20service","id":"The service"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/triage","id":"triage"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/896763","id":"896763"}]},{"id":895502,"author":"jdi21","authorRoleId":4,"authorRole":"a relative","title":"Ward 5E Royal Victoria Hospital - lack of any communication","body":"My 96 year old Mother fell at home in November 2021. Ambulance came and were terrific with her - took her to Royal Victoria Hospital A & E. The Doctor phoned to let me know there were no breaks in the xray but she still couldn't put weight on her right leg. An OT and Physio were to check on her.  \r\nThe OT rang me and said that Mum would be staying in overnight. The next day she was still unable to bear weight on the leg so she was admitted to ward 5E to have a CT Scan for soft tissue examination. This was carried out on the following day. I was able to visit that evening (only 2 visits per week permitted) but no results available. Mum was very confused and upset(she has never been in hospital before) . She has 2 hearing aids - one was in the wrong ear and the other was on her bedside cabinet. She was sitting in a chair in her nightie with her legs bare. I was shocked at the deterioration in her mental and physical being. Mum lived alone with help from myself and carers twice daily but she is definitely in a worse condition now. I saw an improvement towards the end of my visit once I reassured her and chatted a while.  \r\nFor 2 days now I have tried to ring the ward for update on the scan results but they don't pick up. Liaison team have also tried. Yesterday afternoon they put me through but the person I spoke to said they did not treat Mum but would get someone to ring me back but as yet they have not- I was able to arrange a visit for tomorrow.  \r\nI have this morning spoken to Liaison team again who are going to raise a paper request for a return call to me today as the Ward are still not answering phone. I realise how busy the staff are but compared to the Paramedics and the Team in A&E who are under extreme pressure, this experience with the Ward has definitely been lacking in communication skills and totally ignoring next of kin. Due to this experience I am more concerned about the care Mum is being given. I hope a stay in Ward 5E is not detrimental to her health and well being as it has certainly been detrimental to me.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-11-13T12:38:28.5566667","progress":"Change planned","dateOfPublication":"2021-11-15T14:51:50.837","readBy":[{"name":"Belfast Health and Social Care Trust","count":12},{"name":"Patient and Client Council","count":1},{"name":"Public Health Agency","count":2},{"name":"Ulster University, Faculty of Life and Health Sciences","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/895502","id":"895502"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/895502/responses","id":"895502"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/895502/healthservices","id":"895502"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/895502/tags","id":"895502"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt001_11021_110","id":"ZT001_11021_110","score":1},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/neglected","id":"neglected"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/answering%20phones","id":"answering phones"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ct%20scan","id":"CT scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fell","id":"fell"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hearing","id":"hearing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/leg","id":"leg"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/family%20kept%20informed","id":"family kept informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/access%20to%20results","id":"access to results"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/896221","id":"896221"}]},{"id":895498,"author":"BelfastBorn","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Keep up the great work","body":"Booster vaccine at the COVID vaccination centre Royal Victoria Hospital Belfast.

I have been experiencing severe dizziness/vomiting and headaches. I was told by the first midwife that it sounds like it was related to me having a low blood count which I haven’t been informed about. They said to wait and see my Community midwife at my appointment later in the week but to call back if I felt worse.  \r\nAround 1 hour later I called back as I felt really faint and I was told by the midwife that answered the phone that this is an a&e for pregnant women and that they were too busy to see me just for dizziness. They didn’t even allow me to tell them all my symptoms before saying this to me. I told them how I’m a high risk pregnancy due to a previous second trimester loss at 16 weeks and they still didn't seem concerned. I also made them aware that in my last pregnancy, I was ignored and ultimately that’s how I ended up losing my baby because it was just assumed it was a hormonal rash I had, when it was in fact slapped cheek.  \r\nI found the midwife to be extremely unprofessional. They gave me no reassurance whatsoever. Then went on to tell me it’s probably noravirus I’ve got? I told them so many times I’d like to be seen and I was told no.  \r\nI then ended up phoning St Johns triage who were more than happy to see me as they wanted my OBS checked. They were unable to access my notes so told me to phone NHS24 and advise them of the situation. I was also advised by St. John’s that forth valley triage should have an open door policy with me due to me being a high risk pregnancy.  \r\nI then phoned NHS24, who spoke to FV triage again and they still wouldn’t see me. So they got me an appointment at Stirling out of hours.  \r\nI was told at my appointment that I have 2++ protein, leukolytes and traces of blood in my urine.

I went to the surgery in their emergency slot, where I had an ECG. That gave a normal result and also my pain had subsided. Nevertheless, because of his knowledge and thoroughness in exploring my symptoms the doctor was concerned that there was something serious going on in my body. What that 'something' was he didn't know but he sent me to the hospital that same day where a scan revealed my spleen had ruptured and further tests diagnosed Non Hodgkins Lymphoma. This meant an immediate course of treatment was able to be given, which I had during lockdown, and which was successful. It would have been very easy, because my pain had subsided in its severity, for the doctor to send me home with a direction to go back if I still had pain but he didn't, he rang the N&N to find out where I should report to and then gave me a letter to take to them. So my heartfelt thanks - I am convinced you were instrumental in increasing the years of life I had left.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2021-11-15T12:48:28","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-11-15T16:07:25","readBy":[{"name":"Ulster University, MBBS (Medicine) 2021","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/895839","id":"895839"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/895839/responses","id":"895839"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/895839/healthservices","id":"895839"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/895839/tags","id":"895839"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/d82009","id":"D82009","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/concerned","id":"concerned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ecg","id":"ecg"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency","id":"emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency%20surgery","id":"emergency surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lymphoma","id":"lymphoma"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/normal","id":"normal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scan","id":"scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/spleen","id":"spleen"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tests","id":"tests"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20concerned","id":"very concerned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thanks","id":"thanks"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20home","id":"at home"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/896282","id":"896282"}]},{"id":895573,"author":"hamruniz","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Telephone consultation","body":"The consultant listened and noted my story, told me what may be wrong, gave me practical advice and suggested an investigation + treatment plan in the shortest reasonable time.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-11-13T19:05:28.6","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-11-15T16:07:50.363","readBy":[{"name":"Royal Devon University Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust","count":5}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/895573","id":"895573"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/895573/responses","id":"895573"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/895573/healthservices","id":"895573"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/895573/tags","id":"895573"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rbz12_101","id":"RBZ12_101","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/advice","id":"advice"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/prompt","id":"prompt"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/listened%20to","id":"listened to"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/895844","id":"895844"}]},{"id":895409,"author":"iamdisappoint","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"MRI scan at Newark hospital","body":"After seeing an ENT specialist at Kings Mill hospital for chronic inner ear pain, I was referred for an MRI scan. An appointment was made for me at Newark hospital - much further away from where I live than Kings Mill, so I assumed there were no MRI facilities at Kings Mill.  \r\nAfter a long journey and a long wait as appointments were nearly 30 minutes behind schedule, it was only when I got to the scanner unit that I realised that the scanner itself was too small to accommodate plus-size bodies- a standard MRI scanner is apparently just 60cm in diameter. I got in as far as my elbows before realising that the scanner was too tight.  \r\nThe technicians then told me that they could book me in for an MRI at Kings Mill, which has a bigger scanner. They also said they'd seen another patient that day who'd had the same issue, and there was someone else in the waiting room, due in after me, who was bigger than me and would likely have found the machine too tight as well.  \r\nThe specialist at Kings Mill saw me in person - I'm obviously not a slim person, so either the specialist was not aware of the equipment specs at Newark, or it didn't occur to them that someone my size might have difficulties, or whoever in admin booked the appointment didn't know that this might be an issue. But making a 6 hour round trip on public transport, only to learn that (a) the equipment was unusable for me, and (b) there was a scanner available much closer to home, was infuriating.  \r\nWhen facilities are not designed to accommodate fat bodies, and when staff do not give consideration to the needs of bigger people, then those people cannot access the same standard of healthcare that slim people get- this is literally systemic fatphobia.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-11-12T22:39:29.1133333","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2021-11-15T16:10:17.45","readBy":[],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/895409","id":"895409"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/895409/responses","id":"895409"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/895409/healthservices","id":"895409"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/895409/tags","id":"895409"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rk5bc_120","id":"RK5BC_120","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rk5hp_300","id":"RK5HP_300","score":2},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/annoyed","id":"annoyed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/accommodating","id":"accommodating"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/considerate","id":"considerate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mri%20scan","id":"MRI scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/radiographer","id":"radiographer"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/inclusivity","id":"inclusivity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/service%20location","id":"service location"}]},{"id":895577,"author":"Mrs Lump","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Lump removal","body":"All happened very fast.

Initially the experience was fine, the nurse admitting my little girl was lovely and made sure to speak to her as well as myself. The recovery staff member that took her to theatre was also great with her. The theatre staff - anaesthetist team - were all great with her. I was taken into the recovery area so that I could be there for her prior to her getting her GA.  \r\nDuring pre-assessment I was made aware that I would be in recovery with her, not initially, but that I would be taken along to be with my daughter, I told my daughter I would be there when she woke up - she is only 5 and only turned 5 the week before surgery - so I was shocked when the recovery staff wheeled her back into day surgery. They didn't communicate with me they literally dumped her in day surgery and left - I wasn't told how it went, what exactly she had done, etc. The first thing my little girl said to me was that I wasn't there and I had promised - I was so upset. I communicated the same to a member of staff was abrupt in their approach to me, demanding who told me I could go to recovery, I told her pre-assessment, they said well if that is the case they will be sending an email out to correct that information, as if I would change my mind.  \r\nThis staff member said it wasn't protocol, I wasn't allowed in recovery - bearing in mind I was there pre-op. Having been in other NHSL hospitals I know that parents are allowed in recovery. Its daunting for a little one to wake in a room full of strangers, strangers that I question the level of care given considering they didn't converse with me and didn't bother to say goodbye to her when they brought her back - did they actually comfort her on return from surgery - I doubt it.  \r\nThis member of staff then abruptly approached the parent next to me to make sure they knew they wasn't allowed in recovery. What a way to speak to anxious parents and to speak to me the way they did in front of my daughter who was already upset as I wasn't there when she woke, I was trying to console her and I had this person bark at me in an awful tone and manner. On return from theatre my daughter also came back to me with a scratch on her R cheek that no one could account for and a cut under her chin that no one seemed aware of, the anaesthetist did apologise for the same, they were also great in the care she provided to my daughter.  \r\nThe rest of my experience was fine, the two nurses looking after my daughter post-op where great and made myself and my daughter feel well looked after.
