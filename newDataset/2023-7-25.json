This was an amazing practice when I was a child, with doctors who were part of the community. It is now just a mess. Emails remain unanswered, it takes over 2 weeks to get a simple blood test and patients are still unable to request a face to face appointment with a GP without having to go through a triage call first where the doctor will determine if they want to see you. You never see the same doctor twice and it feels like they are doing you a favour. I feel very sorry for the reception and front line staff here who have clearly been instructed on protocols which do nothing but upset and annoy patients. The legacy and good name the former partners built up over 30 years has been utterly destroyed and the current partners should really be ashamed.

They were here within 20 minutes (felt like 3 days) and the 2 paramedics were genuinely amazing.  \r\nI was in a state of panic and they reassured me continuously and they spent a long time making sure my daughter was ok. She came round and was doing ok but her blood sugars were really low and she was again sick after food so they took us into RACH.  \r\nIt seems like she had a hypo because her sugars were so low because she can’t keep food or drink down. We are home again and she’s doing good but the genuine care from the paramedics and other staff was amazing. In a time where all I hear is bad about the NHS I wanted to post the positive.

In the first 2 cases, I was able to get a call-back when I reached the front of the telephone queue for reception. In each case I was triaged and in the first case I was given a same day appointment with a nurse practitioner. In the second case I was offered an appointment with a physio 6 weeks later. I declined this, restating my condition. I was finally given a same day appointment, again with a nurse practitioner. Today, I had need to call again - this time I was put into a queue with no option for a call-back and that didn't seem to be getting smaller. I was eventually disconnected. The website advises patients to download DrIQ, which I have done. None of the options for consultation, self help or medication align with my issues so I have no option but to contact the surgery by phone. I do not often have cause to contact the practice but, when I do, I am reluctant to do so because the experience is so painful. I would transfer to another practice were it not for the fact that the Camrose, Gillies, Hackwood Partnership is so big that there are few alternatives left in the borough","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2023-07-25T10:15:23","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2023-07-25T10:23:31","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1096199","id":"1096199"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1096199/responses","id":"1096199"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1096199/healthservices","id":"1096199"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1096199/tags","id":"1096199"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/j82069002","id":"J82069002","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/physio","id":"physio"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reluctant","id":"reluctant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disconnected","id":"disconnected"}]},{"id":1096200,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Quick and efficient service","body":"I went to the centre after having a fall over the weekend and being concerned about my hip which had been replaced less than a year ago.\r\nIt appeared busy but the receptionist was very helpful and said that the wait should not be too long as most patients were waiting for dressing etc rather than for an assessment.  I had barely sat down when I was called by the 'streaming' nurse and then hardly waited at all before seeing the next nurse who said he had worked in orthopaedics for 16 years.  He thoroughly examined my hip and thigh and said that the hip joint and femur were fine and would not require an X-ray. I had just suffered bruising above and below the hip joint as well as cuts and bruises to my face, hand and arm.

I completely understand that staff are on their lunch break but we were left in a corridor with no seating area available until the appointment time. It was only good fortune that another niece had accessed a wheelchair, rather than use the normal walker, that she was able to be comfortable in her seat. I do feel that access to seating is an important factor as many of the patients will be elderly and be unable to stand in a corridor.  \r\nOur appointment went generally well with the audiologist who carried out a hearing review and proposed getting a hearing aid fitted. I was however frustrated to learn that a mould of my aunts’ ear could not be taken today as she has a build of ear wax that would affect the shape of the mould. I understand the rationale behind this of course but it would have been useful if we had been told to have this looked at prior to our appointment.  \r\nThe GP referral occurred 9 months ago and frustratingly without an ear examination at the time or since. The GP surgery, in Ahoghill, also no longer do ear wax removal and I have now got an appointment with a pharmacy to clear her ear wax.  \r\nThis now means further outings for someone who is unable to be mobile for long, and a further delay in her hearing aid fitting.

Well done Harbury Surgery.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2023-07-25T11:14:41","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2023-07-25T11:19:48","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1096238","id":"1096238"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1096238/responses","id":"1096238"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1096238/healthservices","id":"1096238"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1096238/tags","id":"1096238"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/m84044","id":"M84044","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care%20plan","id":"care plan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pharmacy","id":"Pharmacy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doing%20well","id":"doing well"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"}]},{"id":1096237,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Many thanks.","body":"I would like to thank all the Doctors, Nurses, receptionist etc for all their professional care since I was first diagnosed with heart problem issues, they have all been fantastic since day one and I really can’t thank them enough.\r\nI would like to extend my thanks also to all the NHS Staff also at Broadgreen Hospital, in the Cardio Version team, echocardiogram staff, cardio rehabilitation and the Royal Liverpool echocardiogram staff.\r\nThey really have all been unbelievable. \r\nGot back to playing football with my six year grandson again, nearly beat him.\r\nThank you all, ","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2023-07-25T11:15:13","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-07-25T11:20:03","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1096237","id":"1096237"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1096237/responses","id":"1096237"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1096237/healthservices","id":"1096237"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1096237/tags","id":"1096237"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/n82003","id":"N82003","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/heart","id":"heart"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/rehabilitation","id":"rehabilitation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thanks","id":"thanks"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/like%20myself","id":"like myself"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1106351","id":"1106351"}]},{"id":1096241,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Referrals ","body":"After asking my Dr on numerous occasions to chase up my referral.\r\nI'm now find myself chasing up the referral and this isn't the first time with the Dr. ","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2023-07-25T11:16:05","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2023-07-25T11:21:28","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1096241","id":"1096241"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1096241/responses","id":"1096241"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1096241/healthservices","id":"1096241"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1096241/tags","id":"1096241"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l81007","id":"L81007","score":null}]},{"id":1095705,"author":"Shagq75","authorRoleId":8,"authorRole":"a staff member posting for a patient/service user","title":"The high dependency unit has me feeling a lot better","body":"HDU has been great.

I've been in and out of outpatient help. When my father (my biggest support/reason for staying sober) passed away in 2018, it sent me over the edge.  \r\nEverything has progressively gotten so much worse. My CPN who had supported me through all this passed away suddenly and unexpectedly. One of our 4 cats at home also passed suddenly and tragically in a car accident. She was my father's favourite, they had a special bond. I'm crying as I write this because I'm so overwhelmed constantly over the thought of death.  \r\nI am unable to understand or comprehend how my family have managed to move on and I feel anger towards them for doing it but also anger towards myself for being unable to do it. I feel lost and alone.  \r\nHowever, Lisa has taken time to ensure I never feel this way, to give me reassurance that I always have someone to talk to. She has been a rock for me and continues to show me that there can be people working in this field who really do understand and resonate rather than just going by a book. She is utterly amazing and I feel so lucky to have her as a support through this.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-07-21T20:28:55.46","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-07-25T11:24:10.61","readBy":[{"name":"Angus Health and Social Care Partnership","count":7}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1094955","id":"1094955"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1094955/responses","id":"1094955"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1094955/healthservices","id":"1094955"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1094955/tags","id":"1094955"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/s37000003-chpcs-mental-health-services-ncmht","id":"S37000003-chpcs-mental-health-services-NCMHT","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grief","id":"grief"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/addiction","id":"addiction"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/alcohol","id":"alcohol"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/alcohol%20addiction","id":"alcohol addiction"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bpd","id":"BPD"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/comforted","id":"comforted"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cpn","id":"cpn"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/death","id":"death"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/depression","id":"depression"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/heard","id":"heard"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lucky","id":"lucky"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20alone","id":"not alone"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/passed%20away","id":"passed away"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/persistence","id":"Persistence"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/someone%20to%20talk%20to","id":"someone to talk to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/understanding","id":"understanding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/withdrawl","id":"withdrawl"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing","id":"amazing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassion","id":"compassion"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported","id":"supported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sobriety","id":"sobriety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sudden%20death","id":"sudden death"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1096394","id":"1096394"}]}]
