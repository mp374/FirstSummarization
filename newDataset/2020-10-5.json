This staff member tried his best to make my son comfortable , never isolated and he did this whilst he was at his vulnerable living in university halls all alone over the summer vacation period. While I was 80 miles away, he managed to calm my worries down via the phone and review meetings to make the entire situation a better experience. I will never forget how his approachable professionalism adapted me to believe my son was in trustworthy hands and able to receive the care he needed. Any questions I needed answers to, he had the answer.. Any concerns, he always had the right things to say. I cannot thank him enough for his support throughout one of the hardest situations of my life. Now my son is back at home with the whole family, thanks to the support of this staff member, he sorted a hassle free transfer to a university closer by and further support from a Early Intervention in Psychosis team situated at our local general hospital.

The consultant who was supervising him did an excellent job of guiding him.  \r\nThe whole thing went about as well as I could hope, and I was pleased with the results of the test, too!","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-10-01T14:28:45.88","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-10-05T09:10:59.7","readBy":[{"name":"Somerset NHS Foundation Trust","count":5}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/791313","id":"791313"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/791313/responses","id":"791313"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/791313/healthservices","id":"791313"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/791313/tags","id":"791313"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rh5a8-endoscopy","id":"RH5A8-endoscopy","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/colonoscopy","id":"colonoscopy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/consultant","id":"consultant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/on%20time","id":"on time"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professionalism","id":"professionalism"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/receptionist","id":"receptionist"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/training","id":"training"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20pleased","id":"very pleased"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting%20time","id":"waiting time"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pleased","id":"pleased"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/796782","id":"796782"}]},{"id":791461,"author":"redge35","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"A lovely time","body":"Really good lovely time with her support worker","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-10-01T19:05:15.41","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-10-05T09:11:59.187","readBy":[{"name":"Midlands Partnership NHS Foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/791461","id":"791461"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/791461/responses","id":"791461"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/791461/healthservices","id":"791461"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/791461/tags","id":"791461"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rrex4-telfordandwrekin","id":"RREX4-telfordandwrekin","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good","id":"good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lovely","id":"lovely"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support%20worker","id":"support worker"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/794019","id":"794019"}]},{"id":791495,"author":"lioneg75","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"It was really helpful","body":"My husband and I are heroin addicts for 25 yrs.

I have been in hospital as an inpatient several times , at the GP , phoning calls to GP and attending a and e to be dismissed each and every time . I have told them since I received the few investigations into my case in June 2020 that my symptoms have changed / worsened and I am still being dismissed .To the point where one of the medical team I saw has wrote on my medical notes that the NHS have to provide no further investigation into my case and have made sure to have my Gp put on my medical notes that only reassurance has to be offered to me . I have complained to the health board , my local MSP and GP to no avail , to what I can only imagine is due to what it wrote on my medical notes (which I had requested a copy from my GP , so I can see what has been wrote) .I believe a member of staff wrote lies on my record and I am being discriminated against due to my medical notes , which a lot of claims made about me are untrue .  \r\nI am appalled by the treatment of the NHS and I will be taking this further .

Since they abolished the assigned GP to catchment area system, they have introduced this 'lottery style' appointment system whereby you must call at 8 am to get a call from a doctor (can no longer book in advance) and by 8:04 all appointments are taken. This system requires an immediate review as there have been cases with both myself, my family and neighbours were unable to get an appointment for very serious issues which could only be escalated by a GP. Additionally, the receptions are rude and lie about appointment availablity. After finally getting through, (I was put on hold for 10 mins and after picking up the receptionist forgot to mute herself and I overheard rude comments) the receptionist told me there were no appointments with the doctor I requested and when I told her that I do not feel comfortable talking to any other doctor (as I have been talking to my requested doctors for many years now) she then immediately told me she had an appointment out of thin air! Straight after telling me the doctor was fully booked....these 2 factors make the surgery seem highly unprofessional and off-putting to approach. I hope that there are some changes in the near future as I am not the only one who has encountered this.

The experience of being induced was fine, the staff on that ward could not have been more supportive. After a couple of days I was ready to be moved to labour ward to start the process I was offered the opportunity to go for a bath and have lunch and move to the ward at 12pm that day. I waited until around 3pm, I had not yet been moved yet no one came to inform me of any delays. I had to actively seek this out by pressing the buzzer. My partner was allowed to stay from 9am-9pm during this process. At no point was my partner asked to wear a mask as we were in our own room.  \r\nI was moved at 6pm, almost six hours, this was on the Wednesday after having started the induction process on Tuesday afternoon. Again when on the labour suite the midwife and student midwife were amazing. However one staff member was particularly rude to my partner due to not wearing a mask, they were however at the other side of a very large private room. I was in labour from 6pm that evening until the early hours of the morning however no concerns were flagged due to the lack of progress and the fact that the baby was back to back and very far up the birth canal. This was not flagged until a change of shift and a new midwife. Despite consideration being given to an emergency c-section at 4am due to lack of progress. I was left until 8am until decisions were made, this resulted in a very rushed and dramatic trip to theatre. Luckily my baby was born safe and sound, however this could have been a different situation given the decelerations that were noted during monitoring.  \r\nWithin the theatre, the team were amazing however I was slightly annoyed that I and my partner was asked to wear a mask, I protested and given I was throwing up the mask was reluctantly removed. My partner did however have to meet her daughter for the first time with a mask on which I feel is completely unacceptable.  \r\nI was then moved to the post natal ward, I had my own very large room and my partner was only allowed to stay six hours post-birth. As you can imagine I was extremely sore and had not even had the Catheter removed when they asked her to leave. She left and we were then informed that she would only be permitted to visit for two hours the following day, this despite me having a newborn and recovering from surgery. I could barely get on and off the bed or attend to any of my own personal care let alone look after a baby with little support. We were also surprised given she was permitted to stay from 9-9 during induction yet limited after her daughter had been born.  \r\nI was also provided with paracetamol and ibuprofen as my pain relief, only when being discharged was I provided with a prescription of Dihydrocodine and advised I should have been having these throughout. During the overnight stay I missed a dose of painkillers, this resulted in waking in extreme pain, it was only after I asked for them three times that I was provided with pain relief.  \r\nThe support within the postnatal ward was extremely lacking given partners were not permitted. I waited three hours on the feeding team supporting me which resulted in an upset mum and baby. This for me damaged my preference of breastfeeding and as a result I opted to give her a bottle. I was not offered a demonstration bath for the baby nor did anyone even check I had the appropriate supplies at home.  \r\nI feel the general care and wellbeing aspect within Wishaw General, more so within the postnatal ward was completely lacking. The food was awful, barely any fruit or veg to be seen. The room was disgusting, there were smear marks up the wall in the shower, which I cleaned myself with antibacterial wipes.  \r\nGiven the overall care I received within the postnatal ward I decided to leave at 4pm the following day after having an emergency section. I was in no way physically or emotionally ready to leave the hospital however I felt I had no choice due to the restrictions, poor conditions and lack of support.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-09-30T19:45:01.6866667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-10-05T09:45:40.323","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lanarkshire","count":6},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2022)","count":1},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":1},{"name":"South Lanarkshire Health and Social Care Forum","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/791111","id":"791111"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/791111/responses","id":"791111"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/791111/healthservices","id":"791111"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/791111/tags","id":"791111"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l308h_501","id":"L308H_501","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/annoyed","id":"annoyed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/alone","id":"alone"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/birth","id":"birth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breastfeeding%20support","id":"Breastfeeding Support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/c-section","id":"c-section"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dirty","id":"dirty"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency","id":"emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/giving%20birth","id":"giving birth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/induction","id":"induction"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/labour","id":"labour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/natal","id":"natal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain%20relief","id":"pain relief"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/postnatal","id":"postnatal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/postnatal%20care","id":"postnatal care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/private%20room","id":"private room"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/rushed","id":"rushed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attitude","id":"staff attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/theatre%20staff","id":"theatre staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/including%20partner","id":"including partner"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/visiting%20restrictions","id":"visiting restrictions"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/food%20options","id":"food options"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/793558","id":"793558"}]},{"id":792344,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"They never answer their phones ","body":"Iâ€™ve been in there for appoints and seen reception staff staring at a screen and letting the phone ring out.

I was informed of the many sources of help for patient and carer.  \r\nWe cannot fault the service we received from this department which made us feel valued as both patient and carer.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-10-01T18:48:41.58","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-10-05T12:21:02.243","readBy":[{"name":"Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust","count":17}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/791437","id":"791437"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/791437/responses","id":"791437"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/791437/healthservices","id":"791437"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/791437/tags","id":"791437"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rha-mhsop-county","id":"rha-mhsop-county","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rhann","id":"RHANN","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dementia","id":"dementia"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diagnosis","id":"diagnosis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/follow%20up","id":"follow up"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/information","id":"information"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/memory","id":"memory"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/signposting","id":"signposting"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sympathetic","id":"sympathetic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/valued","id":"valued"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/explanations","id":"explanations"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/792381","id":"792381"}]},{"id":791458,"author":"aquariusky58","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Support worker was really good","body":"Found it ok, the lady he was with as a supporter work was really good.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-10-01T19:03:34.2766667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-10-05T12:21:46.893","readBy":[{"name":"Midlands Partnership NHS Foundation Trust","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/791458","id":"791458"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/791458/responses","id":"791458"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/791458/healthservices","id":"791458"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/791458/tags","id":"791458"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rrex4-telfordandwrekin","id":"RREX4-telfordandwrekin","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good","id":"good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support%20worker","id":"support worker"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/service","id":"service"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/794025","id":"794025"}]},{"id":791496,"author":"humanitiesqx37","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"It was a little difficult","body":"Found the group session didn't help.

This disrupted a number of outpatient services, meaning clinics were running late or appointments were cancelled. This affects patient care and service efficiency. Further, the story was also picked up by several media outlets, affecting the reputation of the hospital.  \r\nThirdly, the increased footfall of smokers moving in and out the hospital is an infection control issue, particularly as the smokers are typically wearing masks around their necks and actively blowing/ exhaling their breath to the surrounding areas. This is not preventing the spread of COVID-19.  \r\nThis issue needs to be appropriately dealt with. The current 'no smoking signs' do not work. Furthermore, when staff have approached those smoking on hospital grounds they are more often than not met with verbal aggression.  \r\nMy suggestion is that either the Scottish Government bring in a law to make smoking / vaping illegal on hospital grounds or that designated smoking areas are built away from the front door.  \r\nI should also note this does not only happen outside QEUH. It happens at other hospital sites.","criticality":"minimally critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-10-02T08:20:58.4466667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-10-05T12:51:39.85","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":4},{"name":"Scottish Government","count":1},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/791635","id":"791635"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/791635/responses","id":"791635"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/791635/healthservices","id":"791635"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/791635/tags","id":"791635"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sj9-south-glasgow-hospital","id":"SJ9-south-glasgow-hospital","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fed%20up","id":"fed up"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fire","id":"fire"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/infection","id":"infection"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/smoking","id":"smoking"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/smoking%20area","id":"smoking area"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/smoking%20ban","id":"smoking ban"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/793454","id":"793454"}]},{"id":791655,"author":"Emmrd63","authorRoleId":10,"authorRole":"a volunteer/advocate","title":"Community Advocacy Service","body":"I referred myself to Advocacy Support Cymru for an advocate to help me re access the CMHT service after I recently requested a re assessment myself but the CMHT would not take me back on.  \r\nI was hopeful when ASC called me back but as I'm not under a CMHT, I was told they cant do anything other than sign post.

I was really keen to get to know my midwife & build a relationship but sadly this couldn't happen & I started to consider if a homebirth would be the right decision for me & my baby.  \r\nI emailed the team back in May & the even the email I got in return was compassionate & caring. I then (safely) met Mags when she came to my home to give me all/any information I needed & by the time she left I had signed myself into the care of the homebirth team. The support from Mags/the team began instantly & I began to relax about birthing during a pandemic. Mags treated me on a personal level & we built a relationship which was so important to me. I felt like I could reach out whenever I needed to & if Mags wasn't available another team member would step in & again I always felt I was speaking to a friend.  \r\nThe journey I have been on during Mags' care healed my previous birth trauma & I will always be incredibly thankful to her! I was then referred to a 4 week zoom class for Hypnobirthing with Diane & this proved to be invaluable! Diane really opened my eyes to how powerful hypnobirthing is & always took the time to answer any questions any of us had fully, nothing was out of bounds. Again, even over a zoom call Diane made me feel comfortable & supported.  \r\nI really believe this type of birth education is vital. I lucked out on the night my son decided he was ready to enter the world as Diane was on call for me & she took the time to call me to say she was on her way. I was excited to have a midwife who had taken the hypnobirthing classes & who I was familiar with!  \r\nGill was my second midwife on call & again when she arrived I felt instantly comfortable & familiar towards her. Diane & Gill were AMAZING. They supported me through the magical & empowering birth I had dreamed of having in the comfort of my living room. I led the way & felt in control knowing I had a dream team with me. All my wishes were respected & both Diane & Gill guided me where they knew I needed it. My partner also felt comfortable & supported which helped him relax & be a greater aid to me.  \r\nMy son was born around midnight one day towards the end of Sept & both Diane & Gill checked in on us via text/call later in the day time which meant so much. My son then had most of his checks with Diane & having consistency was another extremely important factor for me. It was so nice to have her back & we chatted the whole time she visited. Gill also made sure she got to come to see us all for one check & again we chatted the whole time. I will FOREVER be grateful to these 3 women who have made a huge impact on my birth story which I treasure & I hope they get the recognition they truly deserve. The homebirth service needs to be shouted about from the NHS.  \r\nMy recovery has been a breeze, my son is a calm & happy baby which I believe is down to how I experienced birth & how he experienced entering the world. I cannot express my thanks enough!  \r\nTHANK YOU!","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-10-02T09:09:06.1866667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-10-05T13:01:55.147","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Ayrshire & Arran","count":6},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/791663","id":"791663"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/791663/responses","id":"791663"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/791663/healthservices","id":"791663"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/791663/tags","id":"791663"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sa9-community-maternity","id":"SA9-community-maternity","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing%20service","id":"amazing service"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing%20staff","id":"amazing staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/birth","id":"birth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/excited","id":"excited"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helped","id":"helped"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/important","id":"important"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/in%20control","id":"in control"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/informative","id":"informative"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/midwives","id":"midwives"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pregnant","id":"pregnant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/respected","id":"respected"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supportive","id":"supportive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supportive%20staff","id":"supportive staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing","id":"amazing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/calm","id":"calm"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassionate","id":"compassionate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/empowered","id":"empowered"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happy","id":"happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/relax","id":"relax"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported","id":"supported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thankful","id":"Thankful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/educational","id":"Educational"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/felt%20important","id":"felt important"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thanks","id":"thanks"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/forever%20grateful","id":"forever grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/community%20midwives","id":"community midwives"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pandemic","id":"pandemic"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/792377","id":"792377"}]},{"id":791700,"author":"Nobby3","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Day Surgery operation","body":"The care and attention from start to finish was professional, caring and spot on. &nbsp; All the staff were considerate in their dealing and explantations. &nbsp; Felt very safe within a clinically clean environment. &nbsp; Great facilities and always kept clean.

In other words I needed help and support.  \r\nFortunately my GP also recognised this and pointed me towards a self referral to CGL (Change Grow Live).  \r\nFrom the moment I contacted my local branch (Tameside) and arrived for my initial consultation I knew that I was in the right place. The greeting was warm, friendly and supportive.  \r\nI suppose at first I felt like I was wasting their time and that mine was a minor issue compared to some of the people coming and going through the waiting area. However, the councillor I saw explained that everybody's journey with alcohol addiction was different but also very real, and help was available as long as I was prepared to be honest to myself and those supporting me.  \r\nThat short conversation convinced me that I could do this and regain control over my spiralling weight and declining health, so I made the commitment to myself there and then to take control.  \r\nThere are a number of options for managing alcohol dependence, and the team at Tameside are fully supportive in exploring the option that works best. There's no 'one cap fits all' approach. Each case is personal, and interestingly CGL is not anti-alcohol, but more about alcohol management and recognising that alcohol is a part of our social society.  \r\nFor me though - my choice after exploring all the options was to detox and take a break completely from drinking so that I could re-set my system and hopefully further down the line reintroduce drinking wine at a moderate and sensible level.  \r\nA complete detox is a medically supervised arrangement where you are given medication over 3, 5 or 7 days to help with the effects and symptoms caused by withdrawing from alcohol. Ordinarily a support nurse would call each day to monitor your health. Unfortunately, when I did my detox it was at the height of the Covid lockdown so house calls were not permitted.  \r\nHowever, the team at Tameside stepped up to the challenge with twice daily telephone contact including a support nurse, clinician and mental health councillor.  \r\nI honestly couldn't have felt more supported.  \r\nEven after the week long detox the support still continued throughout the abstinence period until I'd developed my own coping strategies, and even now (months into abstinence) the support is still there.  \r\nI can't thank CGL enough, and particularly the team at Tameside for their advice, support and dedication, especially given the unprecedented times we are currently in and the restrictive working conditions.  \r\nMany thanks.  \r\nP. s. I mentioned at the start that my thoughts were to one day hopefully reintroduce alcohol at a sensible and moderate level. As time has gone on my thoughts are now that I don't need it in my life anymore, and therefore it's very unlikely alcohol will have any importance or hold any sway in my life ever again.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-10-03T09:55:36.5066667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-10-05T14:27:16.66","readBy":[{"name":"Change Grow Live","count":3},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2020)","count":2},{"name":"Healthwatch Tameside","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/792013","id":"792013"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/792013/responses","id":"792013"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/792013/healthservices","id":"792013"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/792013/tags","id":"792013"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/nms-my-recovery-tameside","id":"nms-my-recovery-tameside","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/alcohol","id":"alcohol"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/councillor","id":"councillor"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/greeting","id":"greeting"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/recovery","id":"recovery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/team","id":"team"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported","id":"supported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/telephone%20support","id":"telephone support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/home%20detox","id":"home detox"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/802057","id":"802057"}]},{"id":791716,"author":"Kea","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Admitted to hospital unexpectedly","body":"I was referred to AAU after what I thought would be a routine GP appointment to discuss a recent recurring ailment.

My stay resulted in follow up appointments with DME/stoke pathway/neurology and each team were sympathetic, professional, empathetic and a true credit to NHS Borders.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-10-02T10:44:48.36","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-10-05T15:16:33.263","readBy":[{"name":"Office of Colin Smyth, MSP for South Scotland","count":1},{"name":"St. Andrews University ScotGEM Medical Students","count":1},{"name":"NHS Borders","count":15},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":1},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2021)","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/791716","id":"791716"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/791716/responses","id":"791716"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/791716/healthservices","id":"791716"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/791716/tags","id":"791716"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/b120h_320","id":"B120H_320","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/b120h_400","id":"B120H_400","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/b120h-acuteassessment","id":"B120H-acuteassessment","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/b120h-radiology","id":"b120h-radiology","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20test","id":"blood test"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/caring","id":"caring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ct%20scan","id":"CT scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dignified","id":"dignified"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ecg","id":"ecg"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good%20laugh","id":"good laugh"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gynea","id":"gynea"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/high%20blood%20pressure","id":"high blood pressure"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mri%20scan","id":"MRI scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/neurology","id":"neurology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professional","id":"professional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sympathetic","id":"sympathetic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ultrasound%20scan","id":"Ultrasound scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/xray","id":"Xray"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20for","id":"cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/empathetic","id":"empathetic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/light%20relief","id":"light relief"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20ease","id":"at ease"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appointment%20communication","id":"appointment communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/electrocardiography","id":"electrocardiography"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fantastic%20team","id":"fantastic team"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/794847","id":"794847"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/794976","id":"794976"}]},{"id":791828,"author":"Jojo56","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"understanding staff","body":"I had day surgery with the gynecology department.
