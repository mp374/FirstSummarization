He had taken ill again after 8 years of being healthy with no drugs, due to the stress of a family member being ill. Although diagnosed some years ago with Bi Polar Disorder we believed it was more of a lack of nutrition, vitamins and minerals and as said he was well for 8-10 years no drugs.  \r\nUpon entering this hospital they put him on Olanzapine at the time it was questionable what the diagnosis was other than high stress. When I I had read up about the drug and that it could push his sugar levels up the answer was well we will give him a pill for that if that occurs? ? ? ? ? ? He came home and was doing well but had a relapse and mania was showing again due to high stress. This time they put him on higher doses of Olanzapine and monitored him. Then they decided to put him on Respiridon and they had him on both tablets citing that they had to put him on both to take him off olanzapine this took about a week.  \r\nThen he had a Parkinson's shake because of one of the drugs and a rash, we don't know which drug caused this. So they put him on another drug to stop the shakes. All this time on messenger where I could see him he looked doped up but the doctor would not have it. I talked about bringing in a Nuitritionalist and they were ok about that but afterwards it seemed to make things worse for my husband.  \r\nThe following weekend staff said he was high, well in fact I thought he was subdued, when I mentioned I thought he was subdued I got ignored, I asked for the doctor to give me a ring again. They have not to date. Because staff thought he was high they would not discharge him and then have since put him on a mood stabilizer, all because some staff who do not know my happy, jolly, ebullient husband thinks he is high.  \r\nI dislike the staff who are caring for my husband for they know not what they do. I believe nutrition is the way forward. But how can I implement that when he is in there. I am getting to know nothing, just getting ignored, I am not being brought into the decision making or any meetings either and I want to make a formal complaint against them all.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-05-19T11:19:13.9","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-05-20T09:27:58.26","readBy":[{"name":"Plymouth University, MClinRes 2022","count":1},{"name":"Tees, Esk and Wear Valleys NHS Foundation Trust","count":1},{"name":"Yorkshire & Humber Patient Safety Research Collaboration","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/769679","id":"769679"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/769679/responses","id":"769679"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/769679/healthservices","id":"769679"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/769679/tags","id":"769679"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rx3mm","id":"RX3MM","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ignored","id":"ignored"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stress","id":"stress"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diagnosis","id":"diagnosis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/drugs","id":"drugs"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20believed","id":"not believed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nutrition","id":"nutrition"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/769985","id":"769985"}]},{"id":769766,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Classroom techniques ","body":"I needed to see a physiotherapist around June/July 2019 I got an appointment quickly however, on arrival I was stood 10 minutes waiting for someone to direct me to the correct area.

The staff in AMU were lovely. However he was transferred to ward 20B later on that night where things changed.  \r\nAlthough some staff on the ward were lovely, the very next day nurses accused my dad of being aggressive on them trying to wash him.  \r\nIt was made clear to them on his admission that he would never go to the hospital, doctors or dentist; he was terrified of them, and he also wouldn't allow washes so they should have known this.  \r\nHe wouldn't allow a lady to wash him anyway. It's his dignity. He would say to me about me seeing a doctor \"a man for a man; a woman for a woman\".  \r\nHe would even look for me at home like a child looking for their mother to make sure I was still there with him, and no one was even offered by staff to stay with him and at night I would usually have to comfort him at home as he thought the bed was going to kill him frightened and he was in hospital all alone with people he didn't even know. It must have been very traumatic for him there.  \r\nHe should have just came home with me. If he had a slight infection, which was diagnosed by paramedics, I could have treated it as I always did. He should have just had a permanent catheter fitted (due to big stones he'd had in his bladder for some years) and then come with me but instead they made him stay there.  \r\nAnyway on my arrival a nurse spoke to me terribly so I felt my dad wasn't being respected. He kept being chemically restrained with sedation (causing him to have low blood pressure and fast heart) and given antipsychotics both against family's wishes, from then onwards just for walking around and it seemed like them wanting to control him, claiming he was giving them an headache and thus he was missing meals and drinks because of it. But also it was being done even when no doctor was prescribing it.  \r\nMy dad had a drip fitted as he was slightly dehydrated yet the doctor removed it and refused to fit it back up as he told us that we wont force him to have something done that he doesn't want done, however as I was stressed and worried about my dad being left at the hospital I didn't think clearly at the time to tell them everything.  \r\nAs time went by my dad was allocated some carers, a night one which seemed really nice, then two others mainly on during the day, which pushed him about and then the one carer he had more often and they kept throwing my dad's sandwiches away I was buying him and showing a great disregard towards my dad's feelings and needs and even intimidating his visitors. Thy kept lowering his voice, almost in a whisper, to me and my sister saying -he should be medicated if the man in the next bed was your father you would care. And saying comments about how, he will fall down keep walking around and behaving in an intimidating way to us on our visits.  \r\nBefore the hospital went in lockdown I hadn't noticed my dad being given any food at all by any staff member, this was after he started to walk around eating sandwiches a kind nurse from another ward initiated to get him to eat, for some reason I could no longer see any food coming to him days before their lockdown, and I cried to my mom over the phone really worried about him, for him to be got out of the hospital however he ended up staying in there, with this carer in charge, and was discharged nearly 6 days later after their lockdown, almost 3 weeks stay in hospital, staff claiming he was fit to go.  \r\nTo me he seemed very poorly, having severe dehydration and malnutrition, clearly not being fed after their lockdown, dying. They may have on their records he was fed as it was written down wrong at least once before when I was visiting him and I had to correct a member of staff about it because they said he'd ate more than he had which I only realised when she came around to check his meal book. My brother who collected him even said he tried to drink a antibacterial handgel from the bottom of someone's bed because of his thirst.  \r\nHe sadly passed away at the beginning of April. He did not deserve such treatment and was kind to everyone outside of hospital, he would never hurt anyone. He will sadly be missed by everyone, friends and family, including those around Shirley, as many loved him.","criticality":"strongly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-05-14T13:10:12.3233333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-05-20T14:15:15.963","readBy":[{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2020)","count":1},{"name":"University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/769190","id":"769190"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/769190/responses","id":"769190"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/769190/healthservices","id":"769190"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/769190/tags","id":"769190"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rrk99","id":"RRK99","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stressed","id":"stressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/alzheimer's","id":"alzheimer's"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bladder","id":"bladder"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bladder%20stones","id":"bladder stones"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/catheter","id":"catheter"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dehydrated","id":"dehydrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dehydration","id":"dehydration"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dementia","id":"dementia"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disregarded","id":"disregarded"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/drip","id":"drip"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dying","id":"dying"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/infection","id":"infection"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/passed%20away","id":"passed away"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sedation","id":"sedation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20worried","id":"very worried"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/walk","id":"walk"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/walking","id":"walking"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/770001","id":"770001"}]},{"id":769214,"author":"ophiuchusbp48","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"My time in Ty Llidiard","body":"I was admitted to Ty Llidiard in 2018 and was there under section 3 MHA for 4 months. I was treated for anorexia, anxiety with OCD tendencies and depression, and was heavily self harming at the time.  \r\nUpon arrival I wasn’t told about the rules especially the rules about “rest”. Some of the staff were extremely rude towards me and during my admission I had a very bad experience with a certain staff member. They told me that I was just jealous of other people, that I was “attention seeking” and commented on my weight, bear in mind I was severely underweight and being treated for an ED. This person restrained me many times for feeds and when I told them it was too much and that I was in pain, they would ignore me and I had large bruises afterwards that staff said were just “because I was underweight”.  \r\nThe staff didn’t check up on patients as much as they should and I was able to engage in anorexic behaviours and attempt suicide whilst on the ward, meaning that the staff were not doing their jobs properly. However, the were staff who were very supportive and helpful including my Key workers and some of the nursing assistants. They saved my life and I’m forever thankful for that. My psychiatrist was very helpful and I am very thankful for everything that he did.  \r\nOverall there are many things that the staff can do to improve to help the patients.","criticality":"strongly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-05-14T16:33:37.7966667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-05-20T14:18:18.313","readBy":[{"name":"Kings medical students, 2020","count":1},{"name":"Cwm Taf University Health Board","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/769214","id":"769214"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/769214/responses","id":"769214"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/769214/healthservices","id":"769214"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/769214/tags","id":"769214"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/7a55e","id":"7A55E","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anorexia","id":"anorexia"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/attention","id":"attention"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bruises","id":"bruises"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/depression","id":"depression"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ed","id":"ed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/end%20of%20life","id":"end of life"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helpful","id":"helpful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/information","id":"information"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ocd","id":"ocd"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/section","id":"section"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/some%20staff","id":"some staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attitude","id":"staff attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/suicide","id":"suicide"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supportive","id":"supportive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/weight","id":"weight"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thankful","id":"Thankful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/life%20saving","id":"life saving"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/770934","id":"770934"}]},{"id":769801,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Great practice","body":"I attended my regular appointment for my eye injection for macular degeneration.

I received excellent care from my community midwife Sandra throughout my pregnancy and was scanned at T+7 to check on my baby’s growth and amniotic levels.  \r\nWith each day over my due date, I felt more apprehensive as I was so overdue and no guarantee when I would be admitted for induction (the process being you were phoned as soon as a spaced became available and T+12 being the earliest date due to being low risk).  \r\nI naturally went into labour early that morning and attended the assessment unit when my contractions were every 3-5 minutes. Unfortunately I was still in early labour and was sent home. After a few more hours at home I felt I wasn’t coping with my labour pains and contractions were less than every 3 minutes so we headed back in. Again I was still in early labour but the midwives reassured me I would not be sent home again. I was offered pain relief and we hired a tens machine. As my labour intensified I was given gas and air (my preference for pain relief) and a swiss ball. My baby was back to back despite my best efforts in the lead up to my due date.  \r\nI was transferred to labour ward around teatime meeting the day staff. Unfortunately the midwives unit was full. My labour was still slow to progress and my waters were broken to help speed things along. I became hysterical as my waters were stained with meconium (baby had pooped), a sign of foetal distress which I was all too familiar with as a health worker. My baby was monitoring well and the staff tried to put me at ease that this is quite common when babies are over due.  \r\nI had Senior charge midwife Jenny and staff midwife Michaela looking after me on the night shift who were absolutely amazing. It was decided the best thing for me was to have an epidural and hormonal drip as my cervix was swollen, slowing dilation and needed a chance to catch up. I hadn’t been keen for an epidural but my birth plan was “go with the flow”. I am so grateful to Jenny for being to the point with me and helping me agree to an epidural. Once the epidural was in place (big thank you to the anaesthetist!) I was able to think rationally whilst continuing with gas and air. I got some respite between contractions, my labour progressed and I delivered my baby naturally.  \r\nThe only feedback I have is that the seating for birthing partners in labour ward was limited and uncomfortable, and the waiting times/admission for induction process. A chair with arms for my husband and my mum who were my birthing partners to get some rest would have been amazing. They had a hard seat with no arms so were unable to get any rest for 20+ hours.  \r\nAround my due date there was an exceptionally long wait time for induction which can’t be helped. The process for being admitted for induction amplified my anxiety. I felt very fortunate to have gone into labour without induction as waiting would have taken me even further beyond my due date.  \r\nI can’t put into words the appreciation I have for all the care I received throughout my pregnancy. I will especially remember all the kindness and support from Michaela and Jenny. So much love for you guys! And again thank you all for everything.","criticality":"minimally critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-05-19T20:42:45.48","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-05-20T14:54:28.697","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Grampian","count":3},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":1},{"name":"Scottish Government","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/769740","id":"769740"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/769740/responses","id":"769740"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/769740/healthservices","id":"769740"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/769740/tags","id":"769740"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/n161h_501","id":"N161H_501","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/apprehensive","id":"apprehensive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/above%20and%20beyond","id":"above and beyond"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/birth","id":"birth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cervix","id":"cervix"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/contractions","id":"contractions"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/epidural","id":"epidural"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gas%20and%20air","id":"gas and air"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hysterical","id":"hysterical"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/induction","id":"induction"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/labour","id":"labour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/maternity","id":"maternity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/midwives","id":"midwives"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain%20relief","id":"pain relief"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassurance","id":"reassurance"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/understanding","id":"understanding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting%20time","id":"waiting time"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassion","id":"compassion"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/uncomfortable%20chairs","id":"uncomfortable chairs"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/769804","id":"769804"}]},{"id":769721,"author":"Marpm83","authorRoleId":7,"authorRole":"a staff member posting for a carer/relative","title":"Hospice at Home Service","body":"Sarah and Sidika have been a huge help for our dying mother. &nbsp;

After looking at the results it stated some scanty growth of culture. He phoned the surgery today around 12.30 to get some clarification as to whether he did need treatment or if this was insignificant the reason being as I’m nearly 12 weeks pregnant and anything relevant could affect me. He spoke to a receptionist who was being quite difficult in answering his questions about the results and said she couldn’t see or read anything and the results he was reading from can’t have been from the surgery - my other half\nExplained he just collected the print outs from the surgery! I tried to explain it clearer to the receptionist to which she said she can’t discuss it with me for which my other half then gave permission to talk to me but she still refused to listen. My other half then kindly suggested could he speak to a Dr - receptionist said fully booked and phone tomorrow. I asked about being fully booked when it’s only telephone consultations at the moment and explained we were extremely anxiously about getting clarity if there was an infection there as I was pregnant. She said try after 2 for a cancellation. I asked to talk to a manager when she said no manager in, I said is there a more senior person there she said no. My other half then asked to talk to Another receptionist we were more familiar with and she then cut me off and ended the call to which I was disgraced at. \nWhen we called the surgery back The receptionist who we knew answered and we explained everything from scratch and She arranged within 15 minutes for a Dr to call which they did.\nThe other concern we had was out of the two test results the first one had to be ‘repeated’ as the original dr said sample was unlabelled - even though we was adamant we had labelled it fully, then the second results came back negative. When speaking to a Dr today we was told first results showed scanty culture and second was okay. So was we originally told by the first dr it was ‘unlabelled’ when really something showed up ? We are none the wiser as we did not receive both results as part of our subject access request even though we asked for copies of ALL results. \nAs a person who works in general practice I was very shocked with the attitude and vagueness we experienced and was so mad when I was hung up on! That is not something a receptionist should do. I know someone else has told me the receptionist put the phone down on her too recently and wonder if it is the same person???\n\n","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-05-20T14:48:11","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-05-20T15:08:05","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/769806","id":"769806"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/769806/responses","id":"769806"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/769806/healthservices","id":"769806"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/769806/tags","id":"769806"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/f81732","id":"F81732","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/concern","id":"concern"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/shocked","id":"shocked"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/growth","id":"growth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/infection","id":"infection"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/insignificant","id":"insignificant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pregnant","id":"pregnant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/test","id":"test"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tests","id":"tests"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/770040","id":"770040"}]},{"id":769805,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Outstanding","body":"I had my styloid bone removed and the care and professionalism of all staff involved was nothing short of amazing.

An excellent representation of the NHS.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-05-20T15:12:53","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-05-20T15:22:08","readBy":[{"name":"Frimley Health NHS Foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/769808","id":"769808"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/769808/responses","id":"769808"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/769808/healthservices","id":"769808"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/769808/tags","id":"769808"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rdu50","id":"RDU50","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/elderly","id":"elderly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/passed%20away","id":"passed away"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/rushed","id":"rushed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happy","id":"happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/770036","id":"770036"}]},{"id":769809,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Great Service Excellent Doctors  & Staff","body":"I needed an online consultation, called the surgery was given instructions what i had to complete to avoid coming into surgery and a telephone consultation would be arranged ..Absolutely brilliant service especially as i am currently shielding ","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-05-20T15:17:27","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-05-20T15:22:53","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/769809","id":"769809"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/769809/responses","id":"769809"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/769809/healthservices","id":"769809"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/769809/tags","id":"769809"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/e84601","id":"E84601","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/brilliant","id":"brilliant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/775728","id":"775728"}]},{"id":769705,"author":"atlasey65","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Treated me with utmost respect.","body":"I was recently admitted to ward A22 with a suspected stroke.  \r\nFrom my admittance to my discharged everything was handled in a very professional and cordial manner.

I can not praise them highly enough, and thank them profusely for the excellent care that they have provide for our family.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-05-20T21:26:46","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-05-21T03:02:28","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/769923","id":"769923"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/769923/responses","id":"769923"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/769923/healthservices","id":"769923"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/769923/tags","id":"769923"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/d83008","id":"D83008","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood","id":"blood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20test","id":"blood test"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/test","id":"test"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/879828","id":"879828"}]},{"id":769921,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Excellent treatment ","body":"I would just like to thank all the staff involved in the Endoscopy Department of Kings Mill Hospital, my appointment today was part of my deferred surgical pathway for rectal cancer.\nIn our new environment of the coronavirus epidemic, the staff at Kings Mill truly professional & caring in every aspect of my time at the hospital.\n\nThank you\n\nPhil Peat","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-05-20T21:29:54","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-05-21T03:02:58","readBy":[{"name":"Sherwood Forest Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/769921","id":"769921"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/769921/responses","id":"769921"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/769921/healthservices","id":"769921"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/769921/tags","id":"769921"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rk5bc","id":"RK5BC","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cancer","id":"cancer"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/rectal","id":"rectal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/778689","id":"778689"}]},{"id":769925,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Rude, dismissive healthcare.

I don’t believe this has anything to do with the Covid crisis, because it’s always been the same.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-05-20T11:22:50","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2020-05-21T10:34:40","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/769942","id":"769942"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/769942/responses","id":"769942"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/769942/healthservices","id":"769942"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/769942/tags","id":"769942"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/f81099","id":"F81099","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/crisis","id":"crisis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency","id":"emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/leg","id":"leg"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"}]},{"id":769763,"author":"inclusiongg53","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Homefirst Team","body":"I had the hometeam care after being in hospital. &nbsp; They cheered me up each and every day. &nbsp; Not only did they see to my morning ablutions their kindness made them seem more like my friends. &nbsp; I want the lasses to know that I really appreciate them and am grateful for the care given to me. &nbsp; To carry on doing what they are doing is so much appreciated especially during this lockdown, they sometimes are the only people us elderly see. &nbsp; thank you very much","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-05-20T09:26:01.8733333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-05-21T10:37:51.743","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lothian","count":4},{"name":"Scottish Government","count":1},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/769763","id":"769763"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/769763/responses","id":"769763"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/769763/healthservices","id":"769763"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/769763/tags","id":"769763"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/s9-midlothian-hath","id":"s9-midlothian-hath","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care%20at%20home","id":"care at home"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kindness","id":"kindness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/769965","id":"769965"}]},{"id":769767,"author":"casingtm58","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Grateful for all the care from the team","body":"I had a stroke in January and after eight days in hospital was able to come home.

Every day he was washed, as well as once even shaved. The nurses turned him several times a day to make him more comfortable. All this with tremendous care and very good humour.  \r\nWilliam had severe breathing issues and could no longer take solid food, just a little water. He fought so hard to live but eventually the fight was lost and, 8 days after arriving, my Love & my Life, finally passed.  \r\nOnce again, the staff were tremendous. They provided sympathy, comfort and a lot of tea in my hour of need.  \r\nI thank everyone at the hospice from the bottom of my heart for the care, and most all, the dignity they gave to my husband of 35 years in his final days.  \r\nI believe that hospices are hugely undervalued, after all who wants to contemplate their loved ones ever needing this kind of care, let alone consider ever needing it themselves.  \r\nBut should that day come, please remember that St Luke's is only 40% funded by the government, the rest is made up by fund raising and donations and without hospices like St Luke's the world would be a much more difficult place for the terminally ill and their carers.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-05-20T10:08:06.23","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-05-21T10:41:10.62","readBy":[{"name":"St Lukes Hospice (Harrow & Brent)","count":5},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2020)","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/769769","id":"769769"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/769769/responses","id":"769769"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/769769/healthservices","id":"769769"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/769769/tags","id":"769769"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/8ga90","id":"8GA90","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/alone","id":"alone"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breathing","id":"breathing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/empathy","id":"empathy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/end%20of%20life","id":"end of life"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fight","id":"fight"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/garden","id":"garden"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good","id":"good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/heart","id":"heart"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hospice","id":"hospice"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/humour","id":"humour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/palliative","id":"palliative"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dignity","id":"Dignity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support%20for%20family","id":"support for family"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/loved","id":"loved"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/770188","id":"770188"}]},{"id":769940,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Great Care","body":"I have been having cancer treatment since January 2020, and Oaklands have supported me through this.

There were stressful moments when it looked as though I wouldnt be able to deliver here and of course the restrictions of Covid 19. The thought of having to deliver elsewhere broke my heart. I'm a born fighter and wasnt prepared to accept I had no choice. My wonderful midwife arranged a consultant appointment for me with the Consultant I had seen when I had complications after my first labour. A plan was put in place to allow a local delivery on the understanding that if complications arose I would be transferred.  \r\nTowards the end of March i was experiencing light cramping as the cramps become more rapid it dawned on me they may actually be contractions. We phoned the on call midwife and were advised to go to the Unit, we arrived around midnight. The two midwives on call were Helen & Charlotte. Around 1am my cramps intensified and felt like proper contractions. I asked for gas & air and after an examination my waters broke.  \r\nThe team knew I wanted to use the pool so Charlotte set about filling it. However our baby girl wasn't prepared to wait she made a very rapid appearance and was lovingly delivered by Helen around 2.30am  \r\nI honestly can't fault the care we received in labour and feel so blessed to have a wee Campbeltonian ( even though she was 9lbs 3)  \r\nMy experience of labour here was amazing and Im still a bit overwhelmed by how amazing it was.

Not once was she asked how she was. It would have made the world of difference if the midwife had taken two minutes to show an interest and to show that there was someone in the healthcare system who cared about her wellbeing, but that didn't happen.  \r\nWhat makes this even more disappointing is that it is really tough for pregnant women and their families in lockdown because they are only able to receive a very limited amount of support from friends and family.  \r\nIt is also Mental Health Awareness week, something that has clearly passed this particular midwife by, and even more of a reason for someone just to ask how my wife was doing. This is the second time my wife has seen this particular midwife and the treatment was the same last time.  \r\nIt is a real shame that my wife had to experience this because when we had our first baby, the staff at Stoke Mandeville were superb and when we have been on the paediatric ward everyone has been amazing.","criticality":"mildly

user","title":"Maternity Services in Moray","body":"My little boy has just turned 6 weeks old and I would like to extend my thanks to the wonderful team of midwives we encountered. My community midwife was Lorraine from the Buckie, Keith and Cullen Team and it was like a reunion with an old friend as she had cared for me 4 years prior with pregnancy one. The obvious big change from last pregnancy was the loss of obstetric backup based in Dr Grays Hospital. I was lucky enough to have had a straight forward pregnancy last time was happy to book with Ward 3 on the basis of the positive experience I had encountered there before. Lorraine organised all the routine scans and conducted her routine antenatal care in her usual friendly and reassuring manner sometimes with a student midwife or return to practice midwife present benefiting from her knowledge and experience.  \r\nThe scanning midwives were skilled and patient as my little boy was a bit camera shy on both occasions but they took the time needed to get the information required allowing me to drink more water and move around rather than reschedule appointment when I had already swapped shifts at my work to be there.  \r\nThen came corona virus and all the necessary changes to service provision that came with it. My last antenatal apppointments were over the phone until I was over my dates. I was anxious to do anything to avoid having to go down to Aberdeen for an induction and especially with the new and necessary restrictions in visiting. Aberdeen was also a good 60 miles away for me, I had a 4 yr old at home and it was spring time - one of the busiest times in the year for my farmer husband. Also, with the country in lockdown this added extra pressure of whether I would have childcare for our 4 yr old or whether I would have to go through the labour on my own.  \r\nLorraine saw me at around midday and performed a sweep to try and encourage labour to start and organised post dates scan and induction in case it was required. Fortunately, she worked her magic and I went into ward 3 later that night. The timing was perfect as my 4 yr old was in bed oblivious and our farm worker slept in the spare room at home to be there for him if required. In ward 3 I was met by Midwife Rebecca. I was disappointed in myself that I wasn't as far through the first stage as I thought (or hoped) but Rebecca was quick to remind me that this baby was coming and would be born tonight and that she anticipated that labour would progress quickly from here. She was right (I should have asked her for the lottery numbers when I was in) and was helping me through to the delivery suite about an hour later. She was kind, supportive and kept me going with some added humour and was in control when I was at the stage where I no longer knew what to do with myself and no doubt talking rubbish on the entonox. She called for another midwife when delivery was imminent and Midwife Fiona appeared. She was brilliant too. A calm and reassuring presence who encouraged me over the finish line. She took the baby and did his initial checks while Rebecca was left with a bit of stitching up to do. She did this quickly and skillfully and everything healed with no problems. They also made the best coffee and toast! Husband was back home for a sleep and then able to wake our firstborn to the news he had a wee brother.  \r\nThe next morning midwife Deborah came on shift and did all the usual post natal checks for both me and my baby efficiently even while getting used to the new PPE guidance giving us the green light for discharge home. Follow up with Lorraine and her colleague Kirsty for a weekend visit ensured that initial breast feeding hurdles were overcame.  \r\nWe are grateful to all these amazing ladies for their expert care which we were lucky to have locally. They provide an excellent service in challenging times in a challenging location and are to be applauded!","criticality":"not

I was always happy they would help me to sleep and make me more confident in life.  \r\nAfter 2 years my sister finally noticed my addiction and she rang the doctors, which I was then made an appointment to see a doctor and she put me on anti depressants and just told me to stop taking codeine, I did try I managed a year without them, but then I started again but this time it got worse.  \r\nI was taking 32 tablets within 2 days. I would get angry and agitated if I never took them, I started having therapy for my anxiety which then I told my story of addiction to my therapist, she then referred me to cgl which I wasn’t going to go at first as I didn’t think anyone could help me and didn’t want anyone taking my happy pills away from me, but I was so worried about the damage it was causing to my body. I was also so numb everyday I was in a world of my own, so I went to my appointment with cgl, and they was great.  \r\nIt didn’t take long before they put me on a plan to help me ease of the codeine tablets I always thought I was weird that I was addicted to tablets I thought I was the only one until I started reading up and was amazed there was so many others like me that was addicted to codeine and couldn’t see a way out, so I’m now on espranor tablets I take 10mg a day And they're working great.  \r\nThe first 2 weeks I was sick but I couldn’t believe that I wasn’t even thinking of codeine tablets once on espranor, it’s been 5 months now and I haven’t had any codeine I haven’t once thought about it either and I’m such a happier person. I didn’t realise what damage it was doing to me I didn’t even recognise myself I was numb everyday didn’t speak to anyone, always tired, I am so thankful to the cgl team they have been great, even call me once a week to see how I am and just for a chat.  \r\nI’ve also found another way to control my migraines and would never touch a codeine tablet again they ruined me and are just so addictive, I urge anyone that can see there getting addicted to get help straight away, I was a lucky one my blood tests came back ok but my insides could have been damaged a lot more if I would of carried on or I could have overdosed myself, a big thank you to cgl they work so so hard and are there to help anyone who has an addiction, they act more like there your friend than doing a job,","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-05-21T10:45:30.9866667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-05-21T15:03:33.97","readBy":[{"name":"Change Grow Live","count":9},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2021)","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/769943","id":"769943"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/769943/responses","id":"769943"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/769943/healthservices","id":"769943"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/769943/tags","id":"769943"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/nms-cglb-east","id":"nms-cglb-east","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/angry","id":"angry"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/worried","id":"worried"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/addiction","id":"addiction"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anti%20depressants","id":"anti depressants"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/follow%20up","id":"follow up"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hard%20working","id":"hard working"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/inspired","id":"inspired"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/migraine","id":"migraine"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/team","id":"team"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thankful","id":"Thankful"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/770532","id":"770532"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/840449","id":"840449"}]},{"id":769949,"author":"bagpuss36","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"COVID 19","body":"I was told to self isolate by my previous job as I used to work in a prison.

I felt really listened to and informed my whole pregnancy and supported in my choices by my midwives Kate and then Rosie. Kate helped me feel empowered to choose what was best for me and to know my rights.  \r\nRosie provided continual care as well as yoga and hypnobirthing and was very caring and supportive when I got a bit upset after speaking to the obstetrician whose words unintentionally had me doubting my own decision making skills. She took me through my previous birth minute by minute which was exactly what I needed. In the end I am so so thankful to have been able to give birth in Oban hospital - it was a healing experience and took away that lack of control and doubt from my first birth. Miaread was incredible in her unflappable, unobtrusive and intuitive support during labour. The nurse who put in my cannula (though I wasn’t able to speak to her by this point) was also really calming and friendly and helped turn around something I was initially afraid of and reluctant to do. I truly couldn’t have asked for a better birth experience and never thought I would get the gentle and empowered experience that I did.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-05-21T20:12:40.67","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-05-22T12:06:49.87","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Highland","count":5},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/769975","id":"769975"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/769975/responses","id":"769975"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/769975/healthservices","id":"769975"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/769975/tags","id":"769975"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/c121h_501","id":"C121H_501","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/birth","id":"birth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/calming","id":"calming"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/caring","id":"caring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gentle","id":"gentle"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/in%20control","id":"in control"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kept%20informed","id":"kept informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/labour","id":"labour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/maternity","id":"maternity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/midwives","id":"midwives"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/obstetrician","id":"obstetrician"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pregnancy","id":"pregnancy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supportive","id":"supportive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/empowered","id":"empowered"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported","id":"supported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thankful","id":"Thankful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/involved%20in%20decisions","id":"involved in decisions"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/770128","id":"770128"}]},{"id":769559,"author":"AnneG","authorRoleId":1,"authorRole":"a carer","title":"Support Phone Calls during Covid","body":"My mum had been attending choir and tai-chi at the hospice before going on the 12 week out-patient programme which she absolutely loved. Covid interrupted this but staff continued to call once a week. During the first 7 weeks of lockdown, mum lived with our family but as her care needs increased dramatically she sadly had to be placed in care. This has been a roller-coaster of emotions for all of us and the calls from staff at the hospice were welcomes. Staff understood and empathised and this was invaluable at times. Thank you for your care.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-05-18T11:07:04.3966667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-05-22T12:20:00.353","readBy":[{"name":"Scottish Government","count":1},{"name":"Kilbryde Hospice","count":4},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":2},{"name":"South Lanarkshire Health and Social Care Forum","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/769559","id":"769559"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/769559/responses","id":"769559"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/769559/healthservices","id":"769559"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/769559/tags","id":"769559"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/cs2003050656","id":"CS2003050656","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/kilbryde-hospice","id":"kilbryde-hospice","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dementia","id":"dementia"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/empathy","id":"empathy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kept%20informed","id":"kept informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/understanding","id":"understanding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/parkinson's","id":"parkinson's"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/like%20someone%20cares","id":"Like someone cares"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid-19","id":"covid-19"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/telephone%20support","id":"telephone support"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/770000","id":"770000"}]}]
