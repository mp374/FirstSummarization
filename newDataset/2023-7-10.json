Recently, I’ve experienced a sudden worsening of my anxiety symptoms and started to endure frequent, intense panic attacks. I’m super aware at the moment of the pressures on NHS services and staffing levels and I very rarely ever reach out for help. Despite my best efforts to manage my current situation independently, I felt I had no option other than to contact my gp practice.  \r\nAs a patient, receiving regular texts from my practice that there is either no gp cover or reduced staffing levels - always makes me feel that I shouldn’t bother anyone and I honestly would only contact them if absolutely necessary. I don’t find it easy to speak about my mental health but the panic attacks have gotten so frequent I’m worried it will affect my ability to attend work, so I called the practice.  \r\nI’d spoken with a GP a couple of days earlier about a medication change, to help manage my current exacerbation. On collecting my prescription I noticed that the medication had been reduced, instead of increased as discussed and agreed. I thought this would be a simple error and tried to raise this with a patient advisor (receptionist).  \r\nI tried to explain the situation and apologise for contacting again but that I was worried this would lead to a worsening of my already unmanageable condition. The patient advisor was very dismissive and abrupt. They began telling me that I had already just had a medication review and I would have to give the medication time to work.  \r\nI reiterated that I didn’t think they had caught what I was trying to explain and that rather than increase the medication as agreed, I believed it had been reduced in error. I was then told that I was taking the maximum dose (despite this being incorrect) and again that I would just have to manage the situation myself.  \r\nThe patient advisor had zero empathy for my situation. I was made to feel like a nuisance and despite trying to explain that I was really struggling and would need someone to clarify this for me. I was then told bluntly someone would call me nearly 3 weeks later - the earliest opportunity.  \r\nNormally I have always had amazing care from my GP practice and last year they helped save my life when I was unaware how unwell I was and required emergency surgery. However this week when trying to access support for my mental health, it has been the most embarrassing and shaming experience, making me feel like I can’t reach out during a crisis.  \r\nI appreciate anxiety and panic attacks are not life threatening but despite trying all of the self care advice that is on NHS inform and having sought specialist mental health advice from other NHS services I was following the advice to have an urgent medication review.  \r\nI’d just also like to highlight that at no point this week has anyone explored any thoughts of harm. My anxiety has gotten so bad it’s left me feeling at my absolute worst. Suicidal thoughts have been overwhelming at times and this is absolutely out of character for me.  \r\nI’m not someone who complains and for me I have a voice and feel I am able to politely challenge poor care but I would like to highlight how difficult it is to pick up the telephone, to discuss mental health. Especially when you know there’s every chance there are no gp’s or nurses available to help. Also that when experiencing a mental health crisis people may be overwhelmed and at their lowest point. Quite possibly experiencing thoughts and/or acts of harm.  \r\nNot listening to patients, fobbing them off, being rude and dismissive is not helpful to anyone and especially not when facing mental health challenges. I now fully understand why many people do not reach out to discuss mental health.  \r\nI genuinely feel that NHS GG&C must look to improve staffing levels at GP practices. I feel that it is a patient safety issue not having adequate staffing levels, to assess patients. Further, to extend the importance of understanding it takes a great deal of courage to reach out. We don’t expect patient advisors to be mental health experts but listening to patients, considering basic risk and not dismissing genuine concerns will save lives.  \r\nI can’t wait for a week where I don’t receive a text message telling me that our practice has no staff available, reduced staff or reduced hours.  \r\nI am a proud supporter and advocate of our precious NHS and I am forever thankful for staff working hard under unforeseen conditions but please, please we need to make this better for everyone and soon.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-07-07T14:08:28.42","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-07-10T09:20:03.343","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":3}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1088779","id":"1088779"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1088779/responses","id":"1088779"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1088779/healthservices","id":"1088779"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1088779/tags","id":"1088779"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sj9-general-practices","id":"sj9-general-practices","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/embarrassed","id":"embarrassed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20listened%20to","id":"not listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20listening","id":"not listening"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nuisance","id":"nuisance"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/abrupt","id":"abrupt"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/access%20to%20services","id":"access to services"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/active%20listening","id":"active listening"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/availability","id":"availability"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/belittled","id":"belittled"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dismissive","id":"dismissive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/empathy","id":"empathy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gp%20practice","id":"GP practice"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/my%20gp","id":"My GP"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nhs","id":"NHS"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/receptionist","id":"receptionist"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staffing%20levels","id":"staffing levels"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health%20crisis","id":"mental health crisis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/shamed","id":"shamed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/spoken%20over","id":"spoken over"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/panic%20attacks","id":"panic attacks"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nhs%20staff","id":"nhs staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health%20help","id":"mental health help"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lack%20of%20resources","id":"lack of resources"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gp%20coverage","id":"gp coverage"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1089673","id":"1089673"}]},{"id":1089456,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Superb service","body":"I went to pharmacy for BP check.

Sat in telephone queue for over an hour at 19th in queue which didn't change. In that time I have driven to the surgery from work. with my phone still on hold to walk into the surgery and find 2 receptions chatting over cups of coffee, no one in waiting area and no phone ringing?? if you complain their attitude is 'go somewhere else' I know of at least 2 people who have died due to late diagnosis of cancer due to this. They have apparently taken on an extra 3000 patients. Why do this if you don't have the capacity to deal with the patients you already have. There are more reception staff than doctors, and the doctors only work part time. My partner is told by doctor to come back in 7 days for cancer results, 21 days later and he just manages to get a telephone appointment. My daughter is pregnant but unable to get a referral for a scan and I need to discuss operation aftercare but am not allowed to see my doctor as appoints are already booked up to 2 weeks in advance. it is akin to a 3rd world country medical care. The practice manager has turned a local village doctors into a total disgrace. Still trying to blame everything on Covid but the truth is it was already going downhill fast. More interested in funding than medical care. Total breaches of gdpr with reception staff and failure to abide by hypocratic oath from the doctors. They need a full investigation by someone doing a secret shopper role. Online portals don't work for many patients but it seems that the ones who mange to have got it take a majority over the appointments as there are very few released for telephone booking. (i believe it is 3) They do not cater for people who work as you need to ring every day at 8.30am and stay in queue for an hour to be told all appointments have gone and to try again tomorrow. Same and repeat. Killing the nhs as people will choose to go private for the sake of their health when there are serious issues. Referrals are impossible to get. Took me 2 years to get one from GP and then hospital can see me and book in operation in a matter of months so it is GP who is causing backlogs.  Serious investigations are needed into this practice as it is all about the money and how much they can claim from the government rather than offer any quality care.

Where do they recruit these people from I wonder?\n\nI am done with this practice and will now finally move to another.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2023-07-07T11:15:41","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2023-07-10T09:42:05","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1089477","id":"1089477"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1089477/responses","id":"1089477"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1089477/healthservices","id":"1089477"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1089477/tags","id":"1089477"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/k81074","id":"K81074","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20listened%20to","id":"not listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unhappy","id":"unhappy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/in%20the%20way","id":"in the way"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/listened%20to","id":"listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/like%20myself","id":"like myself"}]},{"id":1089486,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Gives a bad name to good physio","body":"Just awful.\nSeveral texts and phone calls over the course of a day to get me to fill out the endless questionnaires that don’t always contain the info you need to input.\nOne telephone consultation later with me repeating the same info, I was asked to go in. They then ask the same questions at your appointment! Then they give a short examination and send you on your way telling you they will email an exercise plan. Physio without being shown what to do is useless. I have a chronic condition, I’ve been under physio several times before and have always found it helpful. This time I am sure I made my pain worse but not completing the exercises correctly.\nThen they ask to see you in 4 weeks….. except there aren’t any appointments available in 4 weeks! They kept requesting that I travel to the next location which is difficult for me to do with my problem. I told them I couldn’t keep taking time off work to come in the middle of the day by they can’t seem to ever provide Morning or late afternoon appointments. I was referred to them again this year and I’ve declined. It’s just a shambles. Physio does not work without face to face guidance and examples. I wish Connect Health would look at all the 1 star reviews here and take notice of how terribly their patients are being treated. But I don’t think they will, as at the end of the day, several boroughs now only use Connect health for NHS physio referrals so they’re getting the all the business without having to improve patient care.

However, like many others commenting on here, they are let down by an awful phone system, which causes much frustration and anxiety when trying to book appointments or just ask a general query. A recent example is when I called the other day just to query a referral which was made 8 months ago. On calling I was advised that I was number 7 in the queue which I thought was reasonable. 55 minutes later I had finally reached number 1 where I remained for another 20 minutes!! At this point I had to hang up as I had an appointment to attend. Surely this can’t be acceptable. What has happened to the call back option which I have used previously, and seemed to work ok? I fully appreciate how busy you all are with how many people are contacting you, but there must be a better way of managing the phone lines. Are there enough staff available to man them? Do the different options offered when calling go to separate lines or are all calls queued on the same line? More than happy to discuss this further if necessary, but look forward to receiving whatever feedback you have. As stated earlier I have no issues with the great service you have kindly provided me with for over 20 years, and thank you all for your kind attentions. \nRegards,\nStephen","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2023-07-07T20:17:38","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-07-10T10:26:50","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1089538","id":"1089538"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1089538/responses","id":"1089538"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1089538/healthservices","id":"1089538"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1089538/tags","id":"1089538"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/m88013","id":"M88013","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/awful","id":"awful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/better","id":"better"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happy","id":"happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/in%20the%20way","id":"in the way"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20happy","id":"not happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20happy","id":"very happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20great","id":"not great"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/like%20myself","id":"like myself"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1098708","id":"1098708"}]},{"id":1089578,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Equal access to NHS?

There are many struggles with the NHS but the staff and care I experienced needs to be recognised. \n","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2023-07-09T09:45:43","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2023-07-10T10:30:48","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1089579","id":"1089579"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1089579/responses","id":"1089579"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1089579/healthservices","id":"1089579"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1089579/tags","id":"1089579"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/nqa","id":"NQA","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breast","id":"breast"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lumpectomy","id":"Lumpectomy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"}]},{"id":1089562,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"poor outcome","body":"I was taken from my gps surgery by ambulance with very severe back pains.
