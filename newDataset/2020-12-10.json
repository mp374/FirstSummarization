However, having only left the house a number of times since March, I was quite taken aback.  \r\nPatients were required to wait outside (no marking for social distancing) for admittance by one of the admin staff. It was a particularly cold November morning and this is not appropriate for some elderly and vulnerable people. A one way system had been put in place for the clinic - no chairs had been provided for those who were unable to stand for long periods and as a result the corridors was lined with people that were leaning against and touching windowsills and walls. Whilst there was sanitiser available at the entrance, I didn't see anyone being asked to use it. Masks were being worn and temperatures were being taken although how accurate these were after a lengthy period standing in the cold is debatable. Hand sanitiser was available again before patients were called into the clinical area and apart from myself, I did not see anyone use it. Whilst patients were waiting to be called in, numerous staff were arriving at work or returning from or leaving for visits, many with bags and trolleys and all using the same entrance, causing congestion at the doors - why was everyone using this entrance?  \r\nHaving been called into the clinical area, by one person, another two members of staff were giving out pieces of paper to indicate vaccinations to be given - I am not sure why it was necessary to do this particularly as these would be handled by people with unsanitised hands and passed to clinical staff. There were several cubicles in which vaccinations were being given and patients left the building via a side door although there was no signage to indicate how to return to the car park. Not one member of staff introduced themselves or spoke politely to me nor anyone around me, whilst appreciate that instructions need to be given - please and thank you can be useful additions to the imperative.  \r\nQuite frankly, it felt like a cattle market - herd them in - herd them out.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-12-04T10:38:38.2633333","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2020-12-10T12:20:01.45","readBy":[{"name":"Northern Health and Social Care Trust","count":6},{"name":"Public Health Agency","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/807432","id":"807432"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/807432/responses","id":"807432"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/807432/healthservices","id":"807432"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/807432/tags","id":"807432"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/nigp-pn4030","id":"nigp-pn4030","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stress","id":"stress"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/elderly","id":"elderly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/flu%20vaccination","id":"flu vaccination"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hand","id":"hand"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/signage","id":"signage"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attitude","id":"staff attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20introduction","id":"staff introduction"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vaccination","id":"vaccination"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vulnerable","id":"vulnerable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting%20area","id":"waiting area"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/social%20distancing","id":"social distancing"}]},{"id":808808,"author":"skibird45","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"More confusing than enlightening","body":"I was having ureteric stent fitted.  \r\nOnce admitted to hospital both the registrar and the anaesthetist were exceptionally good at explaining what was going to be happening. The anaesthetist also spoke to me about what he was doing until I fell asleep. For the first time since the hospital records were computerised EVERYONE managed to call me by the name I have always been known by, although it is my second name. I can’t overemphasise what a difference that makes, rather than being called by what feels like somebody else’s name. I felt increasing relaxed, following my less happy experience of the the pre-op assessment.There the staff were kind, but I felt quite overwhelmed by the amount of paperwork they gave me to read at home. I received:3 booklets: “Patient admission and information booklet”, “Department of Scheduled Admissions” and “”Fasting before your operation”. These were all clear, readable and laid out in a way that made it easy to find the information I wanted.A 24-page A4 booklet called “ Anaesthesia explained” covering everything from details of general anaesthetic to paracetamol, and all the grades of staff involved. This was far more than I needed to know, and in the absence of clarity as to which form of anaesthetic I was going to receive (see below) was more confusing than enlightening. A single sheet about the relevant form of anaesthesia would have been simpler to absorb. Information about whether and when to stop each of my medications before the operation. This was presumably important, and was clear. Two questionnaires to complete at home, and return. Both consisted of questions I had already been asked at the pre-op assessment. One for hospital records, which at least was simple. The other was described as a pre-operative anaesthetic questionnaire. This was more difficult as I was not clear which aspects of my medical history under the different items were really relevant, and I did not know how the nurse who had conducted the interview at the assessment had completed it in the interview. I was instructed to complete it and bring It with me when I came into hospital. When I saw the anaesthetist, I said: “I have a completed questionnaire to give you”, and he said: “I don’t think so”. So I needn’t have worried!A 5-page leaflet described as Patient Information for Consent, R14 Inserting an Anterograde Ureteric Stent. This I found both confusing and stressful as it contained information which not only differed from what the consultant had previously told me, but positively contradicted it at times, although I did know that I was having a ureteric stent fitted. I phoned the consultant’s secretary to arrange a telephone consultation. The consultant was unaware that information about procedures was being given out at the pre-op assessment, and said he would be quite interested to see it. After discussion about what it said he informed me that I had been given information about a different procedure from the one I would be getting. I was able to be reassured that the leaflet I had already been given by the consultant, produced by BAUS, was the relevant one rather than the NHS Grampian one. This did, however, leave me slightly nervous as to whether I would be receiving the correct procedure when I was admitted. (I was totally reassured by the registrar on admission.)A sheet giving me the telephone number of the consultant’s Secretary, with instructions to contact her about any changes to my health. This phone number would have been very useful ( see above) if I had not already been given it. I reached the letter starting “Please find enclosed admission documents.....” last, which probably didn’t help as my stress level was already raised. This wasn’t helped by the fact that about half of it was in bold. There was a statement “ “If you do not adhere to this advice, your procedure may have to be cancelled” (in bold) beside an item I could not comply with as I live alone. Thankfully I had said this to the nurse at the interview, and she had not been concerned (though she had noted it), but this still left me somewhat uneasy. There were other statements: “failure to do so may result in your appointment/admission being delayed” - twice, once in bold - and “FAILURE TO DO SO MAY RESULT IN A DELAY TO YOUR TREATMENT.” Clearly the instructions are important, but could there not be one warning to cover them all, rather than what comes across as repeated threats? The original part of this letter was clear, but the part added in relation to Coronavirus had very obviously not been vetted by someone with an interest in plain English, I had to read two of the paragraphs more than once to pick up the main point. For example: instead of saying : “ It is now policy that all patients attending for a procedure must adhere to strict and comprehensive social distancing measures for a period of 14 days prior to their admission date coupled with strict hand hygiene measures. The guidance around strict and comprehensive social distancing are ensuring that you remain a 2 metres physical distance from anyone outwith those within your own household”, why not just say: “For 14 days before your admission you must keep at least 2 metres away from anyone who is not a member of your own household. You must also wash your hands frequently.”NOTE: It is not the first time in the last 13 months that I have found that those at the coal face were not aware of the information being given to patients prior to attendance, or that that information was not correct. I also experienced both recently when attending the cataract clinic. It appears that there may be a pattern here in Grampian Healthcare.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-12-07T16:05:17.3033333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-12-10T12:25:31.3","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Grampian","count":6}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/808808","id":"808808"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/808808/responses","id":"808808"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/808808/healthservices","id":"808808"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/808808/tags","id":"808808"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/n101h_101","id":"N101H_101","score":5},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/n101h-day-of-surgery-admissions","id":"N101H-day-of-surgery-admissions","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nervous","id":"nervous"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stress","id":"stress"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anaesthetic","id":"Anaesthetic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cataract","id":"cataract"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helped","id":"helped"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/information","id":"information"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kindness","id":"kindness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/operation","id":"operation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/overwhelmed","id":"overwhelmed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pre-op%20assessment","id":"pre-op assessment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/respect","id":"respect"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attitude","id":"staff attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stent","id":"stent"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ureteric","id":"ureteric"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/urology","id":"urology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/relaxed","id":"relaxed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/explanations","id":"explanations"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/information%20leaflet","id":"information leaflet"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/conflicting%20information","id":"conflicting information"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/using%20my%20name","id":"using my name"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/809764","id":"809764"}]},{"id":808893,"author":"kmitch","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Excellent care at the max fax department at RCH","body":"I am a member of staff at the trust and am immensely proud to work here anyway, but I have to say that the care that my son received has been outstanding.

My local dentist liaised with the max fax department and they were able to offer us an appointment 2 days later.  \r\nThe doctor we saw was amazing with my little boy, putting him completely at ease at what could have been a really worrying time. Everything was explained to me really clearly and I left knowing exactly what the plan was and what we had to look out for to know if things were getting worse. This was really reassuring as a panicking Mother! I found out today, after a phone call from my dentist, that the doctor has called them to arrange a follow up for us in the next couple of weeks. The communication between the max fax department and my dentist has been outstanding.  \r\nAs an aside the doctor apologised for us being late into our appointment- for a start there was no need to apologise as we had been fitted in to be seen within a couple of days which was great and we were so grateful for that. Also while we were waiting I had seen this doctor taking his patient over to the scanning department in the hospital himself- what excellent care for that patient and a demonstration of this doctor going above and beyond for those in his care.

as well learn new techniques and information on battling mental health.\r\nThe team’s coordinators Alice & Lucinda absolutely fantastic hosts.\r\nThey made me feel very welcome and appreciated and they maintained a very positive group.\r\nI learned and gained so much over four weeks that by the last session I was actually really sad that it had ended.\r\nI look forward to joining the next group and improving my mental health.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-12-08T11:58:01.29","progress":"Story has a

So it was back to Gartnaval for a further rehabilitation assessment.  \r\nWhilst in Gartnaval my mum tested positive for Covid. Prior to the Covid outbreak I visited my mum most days wearing PPE to help feed her however after the outbreak visiting stopped and was replaced with anxious phone calls regarding my mum's health! I have full Guardianship and have always taken a very active role in my mum's care! However it became apparent during the course of these phone calls that accessing the information that I needed was not forthcoming! Extracting information other than the perfunctory \"you're mum's fine but her appetite is very poor\" from staff was like pulling teeth! I felt like I was an irritant holding staff back from other duties and when I did press for further information it was vague, contradictory and inaccurate! Giving the impression that their was little collaboration with colleagues!  \r\nI was losing confidence in their ability to look after my mum! Despite the fact that up until this point my mum had received excellent care! I am all too aware of the heroic efforts and sacrifices being made by hospital staff at this challenging time.

My only regret is simply that I had done this sooner, I couldn’t recommend this more as I feel I am now at the happiest and strongest point in my life after finally completing my sessions.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-12-09T11:57:29.4433333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-12-10T17:53:49.577","readBy":[{"name":"Midlands Partnership NHS Foundation Trust","count":5}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/809416","id":"809416"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/809416/responses","id":"809416"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/809416/healthservices","id":"809416"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/809416/tags","id":"809416"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rrex4-inclusion-thurrock","id":"rrex4-inclusion-thurrock","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/life%20changing","id":"life changing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happy","id":"happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/flexible%20service","id":"flexible service"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/810548","id":"810548"}]},{"id":809812,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Test results on line","body":"I was unaware that test results could be found on line and feel it's a great advantage to the surgery and patients, so much better than trying to phone the surgery","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-12-10T14:38:53","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-12-10T18:08:15","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/809812","id":"809812"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/809812/responses","id":"809812"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/809812/healthservices","id":"809812"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/809812/tags","id":"809812"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/m87003","id":"M87003","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/test","id":"test"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/810669","id":"810669"}]},{"id":809813,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Great practice ","body":"My mum attended the clinic today for a cataract removal ,excellent service staff 100% would highly recommend ","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-12-10T17:37:01","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-12-10T18:09:07","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/809813","id":"809813"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/809813/responses","id":"809813"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/809813/healthservices","id":"809813"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/809813/tags","id":"809813"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/npg06","id":"NPG06","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cataract","id":"cataract"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/811086","id":"811086"}]},{"id":809811,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Exceptional practice","body":"The doctors always go above and beyond what you would expect.

I can quite honestly say that she has saved my life and I cannot express in words how she has helped me to turn my life around. Through receiving counselling with her, I am able to rebuild my life. I feel very safe with her when I am talking through and exploring the difficulties I face on a daily basis. This has enabled me to gain greater understanding and insight into my emotional and mental health challenges an above and beyond this, she has also equipped me with essential strategies and techniques which make my life more bearable. I am able to comfortably use them to help me cope in my life and face new challenges. I have had counsellors in the past when I have needed them, but her counselling expertise and skills are by far a cut above the rest! She is also incredibly patient, compassionate, kind and empathetic. She is everything and more that a counsellor should be, but what sets her apart from the rest is that she makes you feel as though you are the only patient that she is seeing. I am grateful beyond words for her support and I use the strategies that she has equipped me with to help me make my life more bearable in every way every day. If you are in need of support don't face it alone, I highly recommend the Psychology Lead’s counselling service at Claremont Medical Centre, in fact this is the first time that I have felt compelled to leave a review! I am here today thanks to receiving counselling with her and I am well on my way to leading a fulfilling and happy life. I am extremely grateful and thankful for her support and I'm sure I speak on behalf of many others that she has supported over the years.

I have only been living in Lincolnshire for the last two years, having come from London so I was not expecting a very good experience.  \r\nHowever I was completely wrong in my thinking. My memory for names is not wonderful so I can only refer by department.  \r\nI first went to have an ultrasound. On arrival I waited no more than 5 minutes. The Sonographer I saw was absolutely lovely. She explained everything to me and made me feel so comfortable and the scan was over in no time. She then guided me to Ward 1B (Women's Health Ward).  \r\nI arrived at Ward 1B and the first person I met was the receptionist. She made me feel very welcome which I have to say is not something I have ever been made to feel in an NHS hospital in London.  \r\nAfter about 10 minutes I was called in by the Nurse Practitioner. What a delight she was. She took my history, explained everything to me and made it quite clear that should I be at all uncomfortable with any of the procedure it was my call to stop it and it would be stopped.  \r\nWe proceeded to another room where there were two other members of staff. All through the procedure everything was explained and although slightly uncomfortable it was quick and painless. They were all very chatty and happy people who made and they all made me feel very safe and in good hands. To cap it all, one of the staff had a cup of tea waiting for me at the reception when the whole process was completed. (Lifesaver)!  \r\nAll I can say is that if a visit to a hospital can be described as pleasurable then this was certainly the occasion at this hospital. I know that the staff in hospitals are very busy but to be made to feel that I was the only patient around with no rushing and explanations for everything and for the care they ALL gave is something that all patients should feel when visiting a hospital and for which I am very grateful.  \r\nWELL DONE ULTRASOUND AND WELL DONE ESPECIALLY WARD 1B (WOMEN'S HEALTH WARD) AND THANK YOU.  \r\nIf whoever reads this is able to pass my thanks on to the staff I would be grateful.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-12-09T15:44:31.87","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-12-10T18:53:22.553","readBy":[{"name":"United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust","count":7}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/809471","id":"809471"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/809471/responses","id":"809471"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/809471/healthservices","id":"809471"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/809471/tags","id":"809471"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rwdla_502","id":"RWDLA_502","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/biopsy","id":"biopsy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/clear%20explanation","id":"clear explanation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gynaecological","id":"gynaecological"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lovely","id":"lovely"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/safe","id":"safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sonographer","id":"sonographer"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ultrasound","id":"ultrasound"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting%20time","id":"waiting time"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/welcome","id":"welcome"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/welcoming","id":"welcoming"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20for","id":"cared for"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/809993","id":"809993"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/810007","id":"810007"}]},{"id":809824,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Unprofessional Receptionist","body":"I have been at this surgery for 45 years and have never experienced the kind of rudeness that I suffered yesterday (09.12.20) The day before I made an appointment for my 84 year old mother (also a patient at the practice) for routine blood tests following an operation. I was told that the appointment was for 3.30 pm and that when she arrived she would need a blood test form which is to be collected from Reception. I then called Reception and was told the form had been printed and would be available to picked up when she arrived. When my mother arrived at the surgery yesterday afternoon the reception staff seemed to know nothing about the form.  As a result she could not have the blood test and was sent away.\nWhen she came back home, after a completely wasted journey to the surgery, I called to find out what had happened. I was given little or no opportunity to explain what had happened or to ask why the form/letter was not at reception as I had been informed it would be . Instead I was made to feel that the whole situation was my fault. Even an apology that there had been a mis-communication or mistake would have a gone a long way. Instead the receptionist spoke over me, was rude and then eventually hung up with the threat that somehow the surgery would be penalising me. All I was doing was making enquiries on behalf of my 84 year old mother and trying to get to the bottom of what had happened.\nIt was an upsetting experience which left me unsettled for hours afterwards. Sometimes contacting the GP can be a bit of ordeal because of rude or uncaring receptionists. This situation was well above the norm in terms of unhelpfulness and aggressive use of language.\nI should add that i have previously had some great service from this Practice.  \nThe receptionist said there were only two staff in and this may have added to the stress but nonetheless this behaviour is unacceptable.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-12-10T11:52:48","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-12-10T18:53:47","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/809824","id":"809824"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/809824/responses","id":"809824"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/809824/healthservices","id":"809824"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/809824/tags","id":"809824"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/g85005","id":"G85005","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stress","id":"stress"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood","id":"blood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20test","id":"blood test"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20tests","id":"blood tests"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/language","id":"language"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/operation","id":"operation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/test","id":"test"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tests","id":"tests"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/832650","id":"832650"}]},{"id":809472,"author":"betasc38","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"My stay was very much a pleasure","body":"My stay at xhouse hospital was very much a pleasure.
