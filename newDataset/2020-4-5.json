I flew back to the UK from my holiday and was seen within a few hours in A & E. I was then booked into the fracture clinic, and was operated on within a few weeks. The nursing staff was amazing in day surgery. My surgeon was amazing. Everyone has commented on how well the ankle has been fixed, and how neat the scar is. He is a real asset to the department and I have been amazed with how good the care has been from start to finish. He was personable and professional. the NHS is an amazing asset, and this hospital excels every step of the way. Thank you for fixing my ankle after a terrible injury, and making the process as seamless as possible for me.

I thought no don’t do that, I’ll die of old age before I get into complex care, then they’ll only tell me to get a job stacking shelves in Morrisons. Then there was the practices policy on the ‘effectively’ bed ridden, which must be locked in a vault somewhere, because still till this day a year after joining the practice and despite numerous emails and being ‘effectively’ bed ridden I still till to this day, haven’t got a clue what there policy is?, assuming they have any policies at all, it’s all a bit ‘ad hoc’ down Penn Manor. I’ve met a doctor that hasn’t got a clue on the practices policies, you’re lucky if they’ve got your medical records and even if they have they are a shambles. Then there was the doctor who was supposed to see me (as I sort of lay in bed in constant pain), well he couldn’t be bothered showing up could he, the practice is only 5 minutes away. I had an ambulance driver attend me, he spent two hours with me, whilst I was in constant pain, he said ‘it’s not much, but I can get your doctor to see you tomorrow.’, but of course the doctor never showed up, I think my brother pursued the matter for two weeks, ‘where is this doctor!’, well then gave up. Cost me six months in bed in constant pain, after say four years of exactly the same thing!. Then there was the doctor who well said ‘I have reviewed the letter we have received from Nottingham Hospital. She has advised as you had no acute cardiac problem when she saw you she feels that no referral is required at present.’. I’ve got it in writing. Well I hadn’t been over in Nottingham for 5 years, I had been in Wolverhampton, the last 5 years!, she sat in the appointment and she said ‘well I need to get medical records over from Nottingham on your heart’. I said ‘why?, I’ve been camped out in some Wolverhampton cardiology dept for the last year, it’s only up the road.’, no she wasn’t having it!. So she spent six weeks, received some letter from Nottingham, who hadn’t seen me for 5 years! (sort of ignored I was at Wolverhampton cardiology), won’t be making a referral to Wolverhampton cardiology (where I was) and was due to undertake 6 monthly check-ups but missed one because I was till Ill to attend (bed ridden).\n\n","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-04-05T22:19:48","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2020-04-06T07:16:16","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/753766","id":"753766"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/753766/responses","id":"753766"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/753766/healthservices","id":"753766"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/753766/tags","id":"753766"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/m92011","id":"M92011","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ignored","id":"ignored"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cardiac","id":"cardiac"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cardiology","id":"cardiology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/die","id":"die"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/heart","id":"heart"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/shoulders","id":"shoulders"}]},{"id":753768,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Exceptional staff and doctors","body":"The practice manager should be applauded for this lovely practice.

They asked me to do another test in a week's time, after which I called again. From then on, every time, they told me to wait another week or two, and finally gave me another telephone number to call, without explanation. It turned out that this was Radford Medical Practice, the central place for making a first midwife appointment in Nottingham. I provided my contact details and never heard back. I called and called, having many problems getting through to a midwife, and then again, being told to wait another week or two, and that they will call me back. At week 13, they had me 'on the radar' and by week 14, things were very urgent and everything suddenly had to happen. I had just started a new job, not told anyone at work about the pregnancy yet and I don't drive, making same-day visits on the other side of the city in the middle of the day quite difficult. I felt like a failure, with the indirect messages, also coming from midwives and nurses, that the baby was not important to me. I was terrified of losing my job, as I was in the middle of a four-week probationary period, although, as mentioned above, I had called the medical practices as early as possible. I was suddenly swamped with appointments all over the city, during the day, with the longest lasting 3 hours, which I had to work around. It was very stressful. I did then have a community midwife appointment local to where I live.  \r\nI don't know what went wrong, as everyone I told this story has been surprised. I felt not cared about, including the baby. At the worst points, I considered abortion, because I felt utterly powerless to do my job as a mother, while at the same time facing the accusations for it. The problem was that I had no idea, how pregnancy works in the healthcare system - and no one to ask! The messages from the medical practices were contradictory (call later / call the other number / we don't do pregnancy tests - how should I know??)  \r\nOnce I got into the system, my first scan was arranged quickly for NUH things improved and the healthcare professionals there and at Queens were very caring, friendly and helpful. It took a while, before the situation relaxed. I also passed my probation and my colleagues have been very supportive, which is kind of a happy end to the story.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-03-31T11:09:43.4066667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-04-06T09:46:28.39","readBy":[{"name":"Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust","count":1},{"name":"Cripps Health Centre","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/752722","id":"752722"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/752722/responses","id":"752722"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/752722/healthservices","id":"752722"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/752722/tags","id":"752722"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/c84023","id":"C84023","score":3},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rx1cc_501","id":"RX1CC_501","score":4},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rx1ra_501","id":"RX1RA_501","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confused","id":"confused"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20cared%20for","id":"not cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/terrified","id":"terrified"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/call%20back","id":"call back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/caring","id":"caring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diabetes%20type%202","id":"diabetes type 2"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/integrated%20care","id":"integrated care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/judged","id":"judged"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/powerless","id":"powerless"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pregnancy","id":"pregnancy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attitude","id":"staff attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surprised","id":"surprised"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/timeliness","id":"timeliness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/contactable","id":"contactable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/information%20clarity","id":"information clarity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/conflicting%20information","id":"conflicting information"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appointment%20flexibility","id":"appointment flexibility"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/753841","id":"753841"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/758077","id":"758077"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/770819","id":"770819"}]},{"id":753652,"author":"FFMN13","authorRoleId":4,"authorRole":"a relative","title":"Lack of communication","body":"My father unfortunately had to be admitted to ward 6 at Monklands hospital for investigations and subsequent treatment for whatever is ailing him.

I have had this condition for 10 years plus and have never had so many issues in getting a repeat prescription before.\n\nEvery single month for as long as I can remember I have had to request my prescription multiple times to go to my nominated pharmacy who I have also requested the medication from. They regularly tell me that the surgery is not requesting the prescription, thankfully they are kind enough to give me emergency prescriptions as they've told me they've had complaints from others about the surgery.\n\nThe reception staff both male and female (unsure of names) are 9 times out of 10 rude, they regularly speak over me and don't allow me to explain clearly what my issue is so the phone call takes 5 times longer and have to explain myself multiple times. They can also be extremely condescending, luckily I am young and not vulnerable so can't imagine how unpleasant it can be for more vulnerable and elderly patients to be spoken to in such a way.\n\nI have tried my best to be as pleasant and understanding as possible, especially given the circumstances but to say I am growing short on patience is an understatement. There have been multiple instances I have run out of medication needlessly for 3-4 and have been left feeling very unwell.\n\nToday I asked to raise a complaint and was completely dismissed, I was told that because of corona it has caused issues, when I explained this was ongoing for a long time it was completely ignored and no offer to look into the isse, just stated well I don't know why this has happened - neither do I and would love to have an answer. After having to take time off from work today for a phone consultation to get an emergency supply of medication (which the receptionist told me was impossible until I complained conisistently to be offered one) I still have no answers.\n\nThis has left me feeling upset and stressed out month to month and I would like a resolution. \nI will be making a formal complaint regarding this matter.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-04-06T10:00:48","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2020-04-06T11:00:37","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/753781","id":"753781"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/753781/responses","id":"753781"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/753781/healthservices","id":"753781"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/753781/tags","id":"753781"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/f82023","id":"F82023","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ignored","id":"ignored"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stressed","id":"stressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20upset","id":"very upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dismissed","id":"dismissed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/elderly","id":"elderly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency","id":"emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pharmacy","id":"Pharmacy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unsure","id":"unsure"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vulnerable","id":"vulnerable"}]},{"id":753765,"author":"catsandflowers","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Serious Lack of Professionalism and Care","body":"I went for an assessment here and in my opinion I feel it was not even worth going.

My wife called for an ambulance and the result being that I was taken to the Musgrove in Taunton. The professionalism of the staff in A&E was absolutely first class although I can remember little of it due to my serious condition. After a while i was transferred to the SAU ward where the staff were exemplary at all times, despite having some difficult patients.  \r\nHaving been diagnosed with a Heart Attack ,Pancreatitus, damaged Bile duct and gall stones plus infections , the care and attention to detail given by Mr Vickery and his team was very reassuring.No doubt my medical records from Royal Papworth were of considerable interest but I felt that your staff needed to be fully aware of my colourful cardiac history!  \r\nAfter a brief stay in Montacute Wing I was transferred to Fielding Ward. Once again the staff were brilliant and caring.There I was looked after by Ward staff led by Richard ,Anna and Maggie and my recovery was very well managed. I was finally discharged by Mr Dayer with appropriate instructions to complete the course of anti-biotics and to lose some weight. A bit personal but noted and being acted upon (I've lost a stone+ since discharge. My discharge was at least one day premature but was dictated by being able to get back to Bedford and the lockdown starting.  \r\nI am now recuperating at home awaiting follow up appointments from Royal Papworth and Bedford Hospitals. No doubt these will not take place until the Covid 19 crisis is resolved.  \r\nOnce again I would like to express my gratitude to the paramedics and excellent dedicated staff of the Musgrove.Congratulations on being such a brilliant example of the NHS at its very best.  \r\nWould you please ensure this message is passed to the relevant clinicians and nurses.  \r\nWith my Deepest Gratitude.  \r\n","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-04-05T11:27:11.7433333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-04-06T14:43:40.553","readBy":[{"name":"Somerset NHS Foundation Trust","count":6},{"name":"Sheffield University Medical School 2020","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/753749","id":"753749"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/753749/responses","id":"753749"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/753749/healthservices","id":"753749"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/753749/tags","id":"753749"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rc110_320","id":"RC110_320","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rh5a8-100","id":"RH5A8-100","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rh5a8-180","id":"RH5A8-180","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rh5a8-320","id":"RH5A8-320","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/ryf-emergency","id":"RYF-emergency","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ambulance%20crew","id":"ambulance crew"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/attention%20to%20detail","id":"attention to detail"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bile%20duct","id":"bile duct"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cardiac","id":"cardiac"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/exemplary%20care","id":"exemplary care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gall","id":"gall"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gall%20stones","id":"gall stones"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/heart","id":"heart"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/heart%20attack","id":"heart attack"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professional","id":"professional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/weight","id":"weight"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassuring","id":"reassuring"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/753809","id":"753809"}]},{"id":753811,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Year on year good practice","body":"We have been with Northgate practice for many years.

We phoned 111 it took over an hour to get thru but the call handler was lovely. A doctor called back and said it sounded like I had the virus and got a prescription sent to the chemist for anti sickness pills and antibiotics for a possible chest infection. The anti sickness pills stopped me throwing up but didn’t deal with the constant nausea. I couldn’t get out of bed or eat so had no energy.  \r\nA few days after my call to 111, I phoned my gp as I was so distressed with the nausea. They said because I’d called 111 before I had to call them again, it was nothing to do with them. I called 111 and was basically told that it didn’t matter that I hadn’t eaten for nearly a week as long as I was drinking fluids I’d be fine and that was it. The following day I took another turn and started being sick again, still not eating, was still having night sweats. My husband called 111 this time and spoke to someone who got a nurse to call me back and I had to explain everything which reduced me to tears, then someone else phoned me back from the covid19 centre and had to explain it again. They said they would send a doctor out. By this time it was early hours of the morning.  \r\nThe doctor arrived and made me explain it all again as I was trying to throw up continuously. They gave me a different anti sickness pill, again said food didn’t matter just plenty of fluids and any more problems to contact my own GP -I explained they weren’t interested and they said they’d have to be. Not once did they listen to my chest which is still wheezing now. It’s been a week now and I’ve had a piece of toast. Tiny steps. But I’m still worried about my wheezing/breathing and I don’t know where to turn to ask someone to have a listen to it to see if I have a problem.  \r\nI understand people are busy and scared but I

The staff at SpaMedica in Manchester are amazing.  The receptionists, Nurses, Medics and Surgeons are so friendly, patient and professional.  The actual procedure took around 10 minutes.  Drops are put into the eye to freeze it and you feel a slight pressure on the eye.  If I can go through the procedure anyone can.  My eyesight is very bad, I am short sighted.  On the trip home; my wife was driving; about an hour following the operation I was able to read the car number plate in front of us.

I was initially due to go else where but the company that should have done that scan told me there was a 8 week wait.  Not wanting to wait that long i contacted ScanAssure who told me thay could scan me within 7 days and in Bolton. The scan went ahead and the chap who did they scan explained that the body part the doctor had asked him to scan looked fine and did the report. He explained to me he thought the pain i was experiencing was referred pain and would like to do another scan as he was confident he knew what my problem was, but without a referral from the doctor for that specific body part he was unable to do that scan. I returned to my doctor and asked for a new referral. This was sent to the original company I was due to go to back in January, despite me insisting I would like to go back to ScanAssure. My scan was booked with the other company. I appreciate its difficult times for all but my scan was cancelled 4 times. 4 times i took time off work and 4 times it was cancelled. I contacted ScanAssure personally and was told there Scans were still going ahead, adhering to strict Cornoavirus guidelines and safety precautions. My scan took place 3 days later, the same guy who my first scan, was wearing protective equipment and he diagnosed my straight away with what he though I had several weeks ago. I can now get the treatment I need and stop worrying.

I received an invoice of £360. The time booked was changed to 50 minutes rather than an hour.\n \n2.\tOver-charging\n \nThe next day, Dr xxx asked me to pay an extra £180 before consultation because he needs to read some documents I sent about my symptoms. \n \n3.\tUnprofessional question\n \nDr xxx asked me where I was. I said I stayed with a friend. He asked me “do you have sex with him?” I straightforward rejected him and said “I am not going to answer it”.\n \n4.\tMistakes in Report; Missing points in Report\n \nThere are some mistakes in the Report which I think do not represent my situation because Dr xxx did not listen carefully to me, or misunderstood my answer. I corrected them. I also noticed Dr Xxx did not include my further information into the Report so I supplemented them.\n \nDr xxx refused to amend his Report on the ground that the later supplemented information was not given in the interview.\n \nHowever, (1) Dr xxx agreed in writing to include my later submitted information into the Report; (2) Dr xxx himself included my AQ10 Result into the Report which was done after the Interview.\n \nIt is unreasonable not to include my supplemented information into the Report.\n \n5.\tIncomplete Interview and Inaccurate Result\n \nI was not interviewed fully in the telephone consultation which leads to my answers incomplete, and this leads to inaccurate Report. The way Dr Xxx conducted interview only gives partial and inaccurate result.\n \nTruth is very important to me- I do not try to cover up any my mental illness and likewise I do not want to exaggerate it. I do not need support, help or whatever because I enjoy being independent, but I paid for it and deserve a proper Report which is accurate. I cannot accept a Report which is more or short for my real mental status.\n \n6.\tAnxiety and Waiting- Patient’s Needs not Met and Patient Made Mentally Worse\n \nAfter Dr xxx’s service I went worse. The Admins (some of them) are very quick and pleasant when they ask for payment, but became withdrawn, slow and hiding when I made my complaint. My anxiety does not allow me to tolerate their blowing hot and cold.

The foot was just flapping around. The A&E guys gave me a couple of shots of morphine before wrenching the dislocated ankle straight, then put a temp plaster on the leg and sent me up to Ward 52.\n\nA young consultant came to explain that they were intending to operate on me the following morning. The operation was about 3 hours long using a spinal anaesthetic. I was awake, and when they projected the X-ray display on the back wall I could see that they had a metal plate down the outside of the leg, and were drilling through the bone and putting screws through to the metal plate to fix the broken bits together. The anaesthetist gave me a simplified running commentary on what was going on. The surgeons ended up putting a surgical boot over the foot and lower leg to hold everything securely.\n\nIn the evening after the operation, a physio team came to give me practice at using a walking frame, taking care not to put weight on the left leg. The first couple of steps were quite tricky, but I succeeded in going to the loo and washing my hands at the hand-basin without mishap.\n\nI stayed a second night Sat 4th-Sun 5th Apr in Ward 52, looked after by the extremely helpful and friendly nurses and auxiliary staff. I give them 10 out of 10 on every point.\n\nOn Sun I had another visit by the physio guys who gave me a short course on walking on crutches. I had a couple of visits by the doctors and the nurses to explain the conditions of my discharge and what I had to do next.\n\nThe whole experience was wonderfully positive, and I have already told everyone I have met (online only) that the NHS is truly priceless. The guys in UHCW Ward 52 were an absolute delight.\n\nAbout 10 years ago I had a much more minor operation in a good quality US hospital, and had to pay a few hundred dollars for every small item - a shoulder splint from A&E 70 bucks, hospital non-slip socks 70 bucks etc. (eventually I got my occupational insurance company in on the act). Quite apart from the money paid in advance  (taking 3 blood samples, sending them to 3 different laboratoris for analysis, each paid separately), the time and worry about dealing with many dozens of small but expensive items was totally maddening.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-04-08T00:37:59","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-04-08T08:06:37","readBy":[{"name":"University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/753889","id":"753889"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/753889/responses","id":"753889"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/753889/healthservices","id":"753889"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/753889/tags","id":"753889"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rkb01","id":"RKB01","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anaesthetic","id":"Anaesthetic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ankle","id":"ankle"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood","id":"blood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bone","id":"bone"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/broken","id":"broken"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/crutches","id":"crutches"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dislocated","id":"dislocated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/foot","id":"foot"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good","id":"good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hand","id":"hand"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/leg","id":"leg"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/morphine","id":"morphine"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/operation","id":"operation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/physio","id":"physio"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/plaster","id":"plaster"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/screws","id":"screws"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/shoulder","id":"shoulder"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/spinal","id":"spinal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/spinal%20anaesthetic","id":"spinal anaesthetic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/weight","id":"weight"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/x-ray","id":"X-ray"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/758532","id":"758532"}]},{"id":753892,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Wouldn’t trust these people to look after my cat!!","body":"Absolutely diabolical place.

I have been waiting years for this opportunity, and though I understand there may be rationale in cancelling, the way this was handled was with great indifference. Firstly, no one actually got in touch with me, so I continued taking hormones and I had to call and ask before they confirmed the cycle was cancelled. When they did confirm, I was given no reason, other than just a mention of COVID-19. It would have been helpful to know if this was due to lack of capacity, or risk to the treatment or future pregnancy. I was then told I would get a call when they're ready to start treatment and the nurse hung up. This was obviously devastating for me, though the nurse showed no compassion and cancelled my cycle with no explanation, no assurance of how and when I may be able to start again (even if this is unknown, it should have been stated). In inductions, the Drs stress how important mental health is, and how emotionally tolling the process of IVF is. They ask us as patients to reach out to them for support during treatment as they are there to help, however I have rarely been treated with much compassion about my feelings or emotions in the RMU clinic. The staff do not 'practice what they preach' and if at all possible I will be looking for treatment elsewhere, and would not recommend anyone who can avoid it to have treatment here. If possible, find a clinic where the nurses and doctors are caring.

Just for example, across the foyer there is the RVS shop, which has clearly marked squares to maintain social distancing whilst waiting to pay a cashier that is protected by a plastic screen. These screens are unobtrusive and still allow you to be seen and understood whilst affording the staff protection from any germs that may be transmitted.  \r\nLooking at the outpatients area and the reception in particular there are some markings on the floor which are laid out in a haphazard way and certainly aren't two metres apart, there are no screens or any form of PPE available to the staff manning the desk. Whilst I appreciate that it is a designated \"green\" area, patients are not screened at the main entrance and questions about any COVID symptoms are asked at the reception desk, therefore the first person they meet is unprotected. The acquisition of screens similar in design to those in the RVS shop will afford some protection to staff.  \r\nCome on Dr Grays management, give these wonderful staff the protection they deserve in these trying times!","criticality":"minimally critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-04-07T11:17:21.9733333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-04-08T11:31:04.643","readBy":[{"name":"St. Andrews University ScotGEM Medical Students","count":1},{"name":"NHS Grampian","count":7},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/753847","id":"753847"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/753847/responses","id":"753847"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/753847/healthservices","id":"753847"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/753847/tags","id":"753847"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/n441h-outpatients","id":"N441H-outpatients","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/attentive","id":"attentive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/concerned","id":"concerned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helpful","id":"helpful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/infection%20control","id":"infection control"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happy","id":"happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wonderful%20staff","id":"wonderful staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/service","id":"service"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ppe","id":"ppe"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/754097","id":"754097"}]}]
