I understand that we don't make the best patients but I can honestly say that the NHS has changed for the worse. \nI can't understand why nurses and nursing assistants are allowed to wear so much makeup to work. I was in considerable pain one evening and a fresh faced nurse went to get me some medication. I was getting in more discomfort and feeling quite worried as she was taking an awfully long time. She finally returned with a couple of paracetamols (did not touch the pain) in full makeup plastered on including false eyelashes! She must have been doing herself up whilst I was in agony!! The doctor had to be called and I was given morphine. I ended up having a dreadful night.\nOther nurses had tattoos all up their arms not covered up. I may sound old fashioned but why is this allowed? It looks dirty to me and some of the tattoos featured nudity. Not a great look on an elderly ward, very offensive.

If you wish to book an appointment deemed routine by their reception staff, you will have a very long wait.  Most of the reception staff are polite (if somewhat brusque and lacking in empathy) but one, in particular, is downright confrontational.  Whilst waiting to see a GP, I witnessed this person - who was talking so loud the whole waiting room could clearly hear - bully a very vulnerable patient who was concerned and merely trying to get an appointment.  The patient had probably tried 'phoning the practice - a thoroughly miserable experience since you will be kept waiting for an extremely long time.  When you finally get through, you have very little chance of getting an appointment.  You are told that nothing is available and that you need to call back the following morning - between 08.00 and 08.30 to book an appointment weeks in advance.  It may be that other GP surgeries are just as dire but I doubt it.  The doctors are, of course, absolutely fine; the issue is trying to see one.  The bizarre thing is that, despite clearly struggling with existing patient number, this practice is happily taking on new patients.    My advice would be to find another practice.

Prior to birth I was offered an online course (via facebook), a group 'parentcraft' session, and a 1-to-1 session with my infant feeding support worker Daione. I did all three and felt prepared for breastfeeding.  \r\nAfter birth Daione offered home visits, which I was lucky enough not to require. The weekly drop-in sessions she runs have been invaluable - the perfect set-up for new mums. A relaxed environment and fellow mums and healthcare professionals to answer questions on any worries, not only breastfeeding. I attend weekly even if I have no issues myself. No other baby groups offer such a welcoming place for mums with babies as young as a few days around other mums who know exactly what you are going through. As well as ensuring I have a well fed baby the group also greatly helps my mental wellbeing.  \r\nOn top of breastfeeding support Daione also arranges other ventures to drop-in to the sessions - such as baby sling demos, play support workers, and baby sensory tasters. These are all really useful too!  \r\nI am also lucky that living midway between two feed support groups on weeks when the DIngwall group cannot run I am made to feel really welcome at the Alness group run by Lana.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-02-19T14:11:32.2666667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-02-20T10:43:44.35","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Highland","count":4},{"name":"Scottish Government","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/743171","id":"743171"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/743171/responses","id":"743171"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/743171/healthservices","id":"743171"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/743171/tags","id":"743171"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sk9-highland-community-services-bfs","id":"sk9-highland-community-services-bfs","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/answering%20questions","id":"answering questions"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breastfeeding%20support","id":"Breastfeeding Support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/brilliant","id":"brilliant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/environment","id":"environment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support%20with%20feeding","id":"support with feeding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/useful","id":"useful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/welcome","id":"welcome"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/welcoming","id":"welcoming"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/relaxed","id":"relaxed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wellbeing","id":"wellbeing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/drop%20in%20service","id":"drop in service"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/online%20services","id":"online services"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/747384","id":"747384"}]},{"id":733507,"author":"SH987","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"My son hurt his finger","body":"I would appreciate if someone could pass on a huge thank you to Carol in minor injuries.  \r\nMy son hurt his finger at school today and Carol was amazing.

No one was answering the phones behind the desk You have over a 1000.00 patients and still taking on more when you can’t cope with what you already have.You need more phone lines ?. And more doctors that are going stop there not different ones each time.Its very difficult to get to see the same doctor that knows you and your illness.

I believe there are over 14,000 patients between 7 - 8 Doctors. You cannot see your regular doctor unless you wait up to 2 weeks in advance and they wont book that far ahead. So basically book your illness in advance. Getting repeat prescriptions is a joke as you run out before they are authorised and specialist attention with the likes of diabetes is non existent. The phone staff are rude and really do not have any interest. When I threatened to make a complaint their response was \"do it\" I did. The response from the practice manager was 8 weeks later and could not do anything because they did not know who was working on that day. This is a typical example of an over worked practice which appears to be working for profits over patient care. I feel for the doctors but their \"duty of care\" for patients has to come before making money for the surgery by swamping it with patients who cannot get an appointment! What is the point of having patients who cannot get appointments. Not everyone s computer literate to do things online.

Next day at 8am I rang to get an appointment and was eventually told I had to fill in an econsult. I filled the form in but it did not contain a box to tick appertaining to why I needed an appointment, so i ticked something else and a message popped up to say someone would contact me before 6pm on Monday. someone did contact me very quickly. On Monday 17th I received a letter from the surgery saying from 24th February patients have to use econsult form online. Why was i not able to make an appointment via telephone on 14th February. What would happen in you are at work or on public transport when the ring back service ring you and you cannot pick up. What about the elderly and frail who may not have access to the internet. The cost of ringing the surgery plus the time people who have no internet have to pay for an appointment is unacceptable. My husband has wrote to the practice manager but has yet not received a reply. I have wrote to our M.P. and would urge any patient who is not satisfied to do the same.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-02-20T11:34:41","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-02-20T11:50:09","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/743470","id":"743470"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/743470/responses","id":"743470"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/743470/healthservices","id":"743470"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/743470/tags","id":"743470"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l83006","id":"L83006","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/elderly","id":"elderly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frail","id":"frail"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20satisfied","id":"very satisfied"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/satisfied","id":"satisfied"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/748161","id":"748161"}]},{"id":743468,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Good Modern Practice ","body":"No nonsense, no fuss.\nNew iconsultation works very very well\nSaves phone call waiting for an appointment and gets the job done quickly and efficiently where possible ( eg my recent sick note experience ) ","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-02-20T11:43:30","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2020-02-20T11:52:59","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/743468","id":"743468"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/743468/responses","id":"743468"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/743468/healthservices","id":"743468"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/743468/tags","id":"743468"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/j81005","id":"J81005","score":null}]},{"id":743472,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Very member of staff re stars ","body":"From arriving at  A&E, onto resus unit and then on to CCU my care and how I was treated could not have been better.\n\nEvery department and me ever of staff I have mentioned should be congratulated in their level of care.\nEvery single member of staff were complete stars from reception, nurses to doctors.\n\nI would place my life in their hands which I pretty much will be doing in a months time\n\nWell done burton, and well done the NHS\n\nProud","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-02-20T11:51:09","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2020-02-20T11:54:47","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/743472","id":"743472"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/743472/responses","id":"743472"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/743472/healthservices","id":"743472"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/743472/tags","id":"743472"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rtg02","id":"RTG02","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ccu","id":"ccu"}]},{"id":743216,"author":"TaylorB","authorRoleId":3,"authorRole":"a parent/guardian","title":"Endocrinology Appointment","body":"My daughter was given an outpatient appointment with the Endocrinology Department, within the Children's Hospital at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital for the beginning of February 2020.  \r\nThe date of the appointment clashed with a weekend away our family had planned, so I contacted the central booking office to ask if this could be re-scheduled. The central booking office cancelled the appointment, but told us they could not re-book and that the Endocrinology department would be informed and re-book for us asap.  \r\n2 weeks had passed and I had received no new appointment for my daughter. I called the central booking office, they could give me no information. I called Endocrinology secretary directly, and got an answer phone. I left a message on the voicemail with my daughters CHI number, my name and number and requested a call back.  \r\nI got no response, so one week later I called the Endocrinology department again. The phone was answered by a member of the admin staff who took my daughters name and acknowledged we had called the week before, but they personally hadn't been here and noone is checking the phones.  \r\nThis admin staff member told me my daughters appointment would be re-scheduled. They could not tell me how much longer we would have to wait or when the new appointment would be.  \r\nThis staff member also inferred on the phone that we had simply not turned up for the appointment, which was most worrying. I cancelled 3 weeks in advance, as I am well aware of the pressure on the services, and issues with DNAs.  \r\nI asked for a call back and was told they would speak to the relevant Consultant and get back to me that day or the next. It is several days down the line and I have had no response.  \r\nDue to a simple clash with our weekend away and the appointment, we have now waited an additional 3 weeks on top of the 10 weeks we waited for the appointment in the first place.  \r\nI am becoming more concerned by my 5 year old daughters presentation, the details of which I won't go into here. This is causing anxiety for myself and my husband.  \r\nThe communication here has been very poor, and I am extremely disappointed at the lengths I have had to go to wait in telephone queues, leave voicemails, be told I was getting contacted and have a return of absolutely nothing. I do wonder how those less able than myself cope in these situations.  \r\nFor this reason I thought best to put this through Care Opinion in the hope it doesn't happen to someone else, with a health concern about a small child.  \r\nIn the meantime I will need to keep plugging away to get a response. Not ideal with a busy job and life.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-02-19T15:55:46.0666667","progress":"Change planned","dateOfPublication":"2020-02-20T11:55:14.193","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":11},{"name":"Office of Clare Haughey, MSP for Rutherglen","count":1},{"name":"Scottish Government","count":1},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/743216","id":"743216"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/743216/responses","id":"743216"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/743216/healthservices","id":"743216"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/743216/tags","id":"743216"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sj9-children-paediatrics","id":"sj9-children-paediatrics","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/annoyed","id":"annoyed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/worried","id":"worried"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/attitude","id":"attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/call%20back","id":"call back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/concerned","id":"concerned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/endocrinology","id":"endocrinology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication%20between%20departments","id":"communication between departments"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/743540","id":"743540"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/743566","id":"743566"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/746183","id":"746183"}]},{"id":743476,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Disappointing","body":"I managed to eventually make an appointment for which I had to wait 3 weeks - fine as it wasn't too urgent; just a great deal of discomfort from something I had experienced before.

I know that I can trust this care home to provide the care that my mother needs and to take into account her wishes.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-02-13T18:06:04.65","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2020-02-20T12:20:01.227","readBy":[],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/741732","id":"741732"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/741732/responses","id":"741732"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/741732/healthservices","id":"741732"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/741732/tags","id":"741732"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/1-120221452","id":"1-120221452","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/attention%20to%20detail","id":"attention to detail"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care%20home","id":"care home"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/caring","id":"caring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/safe","id":"safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/trust","id":"Trust"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/person%20centred%20care","id":"Person centred care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/family%20kept%20informed","id":"family kept informed"}]},{"id":743482,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"grotty and uncared for","body":"Filthy windows, graffiti that's not cleaned off, doors that need painting, patients with dementia left to rot in bed.

I was told that she did not need to be assessed at that time but was given open access to the Ward if she did not improve. I was happy with this and when I phoned the Ward, they were helpful and there was no issue arranging an assessment.  \r\nOn arrival, the Ward was busy, but we were shown to a waiting room and triaged promptly, where my daughter was found to have a blood sugar of 1.7. This was treated promptly by nursing staff with good communication of what was happening and my daughter was quickly taken to a treatment room to have blood taken and a venflon inserted. My daughter was then put in a bed.  \r\nI was told my father and 10 month old baby could not stay as this would mean there was 3 visitors around the bed and the Ward policy is 2. I feel that some discretion could have been used here but it was a minor issue. I was asked to take a urine sample from her and give her a glucose drink. My daughter was lethargic and was refusing oral intake as she vomited every time she tried to take fluid, as she did during her triage, and therefore despite me trying, she refused the glucose drink. I informed nursing staff of this promptly.  \r\nThe next time we saw nursing staff was for a set of observations, when I asked when a decision would be made regarding admission as I am a single mum with a 10 month old who I would need to arrange childcare for and it was now evening. I was told medical staff would come and assess my daughter. She fell asleep 10 minutes before being reviewed by medical staff. I did not feel it was appropriate to keep waking her as I had done as she continued to refuse fluids and I had informed staff and was distressed ++ when woken.  \r\nThe member of medical staff did not introduce themselves to me. The opening sentence was that a decision could not be made on whether my daughter would be admitted or not if I don’t try and give her fluids and that this staff member had been busy dealing with an emergency. I would like to clarify that I never commented on how long it took my daughter to be reviewed by medical staff and that I only asked when a decision would be made to allow my 10 month old daughter to be taken home if my 2 year old was being admitted as it was 8pm at night, no childcare arrangements had been made and we live a 30 minute drive from the hospital.  \r\nWhen I tried to explain that my daughter was referred as she was refusing fluids due to associating this with vomiting as she had been unable to keep fluids down up to this point and that I can’t force her to drink when she does not wish to, I was told I was “confrontational”. I was upset by this as I am a medical professional myself and did not raise my voice or use abusive language. I had also spent by this time the best part of 24 hours trying to get my daughter to drink and failing and I felt it was implied I wasn’t trying hard enough.  \r\nThis medical staff member then proceeded to try and take an extremely brief history, which I feel may have been helpful initially to understand why my daughter was there however any rapport was lost by this stage. Examination was through and I was told my daughter would be admitted for Iv fluids and to no longer try to give her oral fluids and allow her to rest, contradictory to what I had been told by the same member of staff 10 minutes previously.  \r\nShe was transferred to Ward 20 and I cannot speak more highly of the night shift staff who took care of my daughter. I was allowed to settle my daughter in the way I felt appropriate, was shown around the Ward and my daughter was checked on frequently and appropriately. Communication was excellent and I was aware of what was going to happen and when. There was toys available on the Ward which helps keep the children entertained, particularly if they can’t leave the bed.  \r\nMy only other issues with Ward 20 is that adult cutlery is supplied with meals. My 2 year old couldn’t fit the spoon in her mouth making it difficult for her to eat the soup so more age appropriate cutlery would be a good idea. My daughter also had a cows milk allergy and I had to provide my own food as there was no appropriate alternatives on the ward, however I appreciate this was mainly due to time constraints. There did appear to be a lack of communication among staff about dietary allergies as my daughter was given food with milk in it and although meant kindly, the member of staff did not appear to realise my daughter’s allergy. In this case, not a huge problem however in more serious allergies, this lack of communication could have had serious consequences.  \r\nI appreciate staff are extremely busy and are working very hard however no parent wants their child admitted to hospital and good communication skills, particularly from medical staff more than nursing staff in this case, would have gone a long way to making this a better patient journey.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-02-19T20:28:17.9666667","progress":"Change planned","dateOfPublication":"2020-02-20T12:32:14.78","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lanarkshire","count":10},{"name":"Plymouth University BSc Adult Nursing 2019-09","count":1},{"name":"North Lanarkshire Health & Social Care Partnership","count":1},{"name":"Partnership for Change","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/743287","id":"743287"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/743287/responses","id":"743287"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/743287/healthservices","id":"743287"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/743287/tags","id":"743287"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l308h_420","id":"L308H_420","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/allergy","id":"allergy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood","id":"blood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20sugar","id":"blood sugar"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fluids","id":"fluids"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helpful","id":"helpful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kept%20informed","id":"kept informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lethargic","id":"lethargic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/oral","id":"oral"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/paediatric","id":"paediatric"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20introduction","id":"staff introduction"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/toys","id":"toys"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/triage","id":"triage"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vomiting","id":"vomiting"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reluctant","id":"reluctant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/building%20rapport","id":"building rapport"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/flexible%20visiting","id":"flexible visiting"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/allergy%20precautions","id":"allergy precautions"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cutlery","id":"cutlery"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/743494","id":"743494"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/753432","id":"753432"}]},{"id":743291,"author":"J and J","authorRoleId":4,"authorRole":"a relative","title":"The Amazing ....Ward 4C Haematology","body":"When my partner was diagnosed with leukaemia and admitted to the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital , Ward 4C we instantly knew that this ward was special and very different to anything we’d seen before.  \r\nWe arrived on the ward in shock and just broken with the news having just came through a tough year with him battling throat cancer .
