[{"id":1071796,"author":"Carl825","authorRoleId":4,"authorRole":"a relative","title":"Their love, care, and dedication shine through","body":"I am writing to express my heartfelt appreciation for the incredible care and support provided by the Fife Palliative Care Team, specifically, the remarkable ladies I have had the privilege of meeting: Alison, Hannah, Anne, Suzanne, Lynne, Jane, and Lisa.  \r\nFrom the moment I encountered this dedicated team, it was clear that their commitment to their work goes far beyond just a job—it is a genuine calling. The care, compassion, and unwavering dedication they exhibit are truly remarkable. Each member of the team brings a unique blend of expertise, kindness, and empathy, creating an environment of comfort and support for both patients and their families and friends.  \r\nAllow me to share a story that captures the essence of their extraordinary approach. It reminds me of the timeless tale of the three bricklayers who were constructing St. Paul's Cathedral following the devastating fire of London in 1666. In 1671, Christopher Wren, the architect, observed the bricklayers diligently working on a scaffold. He approached the first bricklayer and asked, \"What are you doing?\" The bricklayer responded, \"I'm a bricklayer. I'm working hard, laying bricks to feed my family.\" The second bricklayer replied, \"I'm a builder. I'm building a wall.\" However, it was the third bricklayer, the most productive and future leader of the group, who responded with enthusiasm, \"I'm a cathedral builder. I'm constructing a magnificent cathedral for The Almighty.\"  \r\nWhen I think of the Fife Palliative Care Team, this story resonates deeply. They are not merely healthcare professionals fulfilling their duties; they are driven by a higher purpose. Their love, care, and dedication shine through in every interaction, especially in the exceptional support they provide to my dear Mum. I cannot express how grateful I am for their presence in our lives. They have truly gone above and beyond, surpassing any expectations I could have had.  \r\nAlison, Hannah, Suzanne, Lynne, Jane, and Lisa have not only cared for my Mum's physical needs but also provided immense emotional support during this challenging time. Their attentiveness, expertise, and genuine concern have brought immeasurable comfort to me and friends. I am constantly amazed by their ability to create a warm and nurturing environment, making my Mum feel safe and cherished.  \r\nI wanted to take a moment to acknowledge and celebrate the Fife Palliative Care Team for their extraordinary work and the positive impact they have made on countless lives. Their unwavering commitment to their calling is an inspiration to us all. I firmly believe that their dedication and compassionate approach are deserving of the highest recognition.  \r\nPlease convey my deepest gratitude and appreciation to Alison, Hannah, Suzanne, Lynne, Jane, Lisa, and the entire Fife Palliative Care Team. Their devotion and exceptional care have touched our hearts and provided solace during a difficult journey. I couldn't have asked for a more remarkable group of individuals to support my Mum during this time.  \r\nThank you for providing me with the opportunity to share my gratitude. The work of the Fife Palliative Care Team truly deserves to be celebrated and acknowledged.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-05-27T15:07:27.19","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-06-01T07:22:14.347","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Fife","count":8}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1071796","id":"1071796"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1071796/responses","id":"1071796"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1071796/healthservices","id":"1071796"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1071796/tags","id":"1071796"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sf9-community-services-comms-palliative-care","id":"SF9-Community-Services-comms-palliative-care","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/concern","id":"concern"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/above%20and%20beyond","id":"above and beyond"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/empathy","id":"empathy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/expertise","id":"expertise"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/great%20service","id":"great service"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kindness","id":"kindness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/palliative","id":"palliative"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/safe","id":"safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/well%20cared%20for","id":"well cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appreciative","id":"appreciative"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassion","id":"compassion"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported","id":"supported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/great%20team","id":"great team"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/forever%20grateful","id":"forever grateful"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1073101","id":"1073101"}]},{"id":1072837,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Disappointing and unhelpful service ","body":"A GP referral for me. The 1st appointment was very disappointing. I was basically taken through a questionnaire I had pre-filled before the appointment and asked the same questions again that were clearly profiling me. The therapist was not listening or interested just rushing through the questionnaire. Despite telling the person I lived alone they still went on to ask questions if I was a threat to children or others in my household. I reminded them I lived alone only to be scolded and told they had to ask all the questions in front of them. Unpleasant experience, was so impersonal and very robotic. In the end I answered the questions with the answers I felt they were looking for, I didn’t see the point being honest as I clearly wasn’t being listened to anyway, it was just box ticking exercise. Once the questions finished I was told my answers would be reviewed by a senior therapist team leader and I would get a phone call back the next day or definitely emailed with feedback if they didn’t have time to call me. Weeks later and I have not heard anything back from them. Not surprised really it was an appalling experience and not one I wish to repeat. I will battle on trying to work out things on my own and whatever little support my GP can offer.

I can't remember seeing the paramedics or any staff in A&E as I was so unwell. I was moved up to MHDU, where I spent 4 days and the care I received was absolutely brilliant. I can't fault anything and wish I could remember the staff's names, but unfortunately I've forgotten. I was then transferred to ward 43 where again the care I received was faultless and the staff where always kind and cheerful. I spent over a week there and then I was moved onto my 3rd and final ward on the Monday night. This is when the highs became the lows of my patient journey. After arriving in ward 6, I was placed in a bay with another 2 patients. The nurses station was right outside and the noise during the night from staff talking, laughing etc was unbelievable (but as much as I couldn't sleep, it was nice to hear laughter). I had lost a lot of weight (9lbs) since coming into hospital (20 days) as I was lactose intolerant and I was supposed to be on an energy dense diet, this rarely happened, but was told by the dietitian that I can eat what I want as I knew my own body. In the 5 days I spent in ward 6, I was offered a wash twice and I was weak so I needed assistance which I didn't get most of the time. I also needed help getting to the toilet, which was down the corridor. Many times I pressed my buzzer and after watching staff standing outside the bay on their mobiles they'd eventually come and switch the buzzer off. Sometimes they'd switch it off, leave and not come back. My daughter, who is a nurse, had to toilet me and help me wash and dress and get me out my bed quite a few times while I was in hospital as staff would switch off my buzzer then disappear, this is basic nursing care. As someone with severe copd I was left to lie in bed, even after I asked if I could sit in my chair. One morning a nurse put me on 4 litres of oxygen as she deemed my o2 sats too low, they were 88% which is the normal range for copd.On the Friday after arriving in ward 6, myself and my daughter were told I was getting home that day. The Dr said they'd get physio to cast an eye on me and then I could go home. My daughter left to get things sorted and said she'd come in later on when I was getting discharged. The physio came and saw me and was happy for me to go home so I messaged my daughter to tell her. She tried phoning the ward multiple times, but was hung up on a few times. When she got through to a staff member it was nightshift who told her I wasn't getting home as physio needed to see me, even though that had already taken place. The next day my daughter arrived on the ward and I just cried and begged her to get me out of here because I didn't think I would last much longer. I explained that the housekeeper had taken away my soup, as they said they weren't getting in trouble for me eating leek and potato soup. Instead for lunch I was given 2 bits of dry bread and a banana (not even a knife to cut it). I was 38kg on admission and 33kg on this particular morning. My daughter then spoke to staff and said that I was for discharge the day before and that my medication and letter was sitting on my table. Again they mentioned about the physio and that I wouldn't be seen until the Monday or Tuesday and again my daughter said the physio had seen me the day before. A member of staff then got my notes and read that the Dr, physio and Dietitian were happy for me to go home on the Friday, the staff member then said that they were too busy to discharge me home. My medication etc were on my table and my daughter was coming for me, so everything was in place. Within half an hour I was out the door and within 2 weeks I'm walking longer distances on my own, have put on a stone and my mental health has never been better. I know the NHS is under pressure and they do a fantastic job under pressure, but I felt there was zero communication between staff and no basic nursing care in this ward. I was just left to lie in a bed even though I asked to sit in a chair many times then had the embarrassment of my daughter dressing me and helping me onto a bedpan, it was undignified to say the least. My mood was so low and hope I never have to return.As I said before A&E, MHDU and ward 43 where brilliant. It's a shame that the experience of the last ward is what sticks in my mind most of all.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-05-28T16:14:11.5866667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-06-01T07:50:07.333","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Fife","count":13},{"name":"NHS Education for Scotland","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1072007","id":"1072007"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1072007/responses","id":"1072007"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1072007/healthservices","id":"1072007"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1072007/tags","id":"1072007"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/f704h_180","id":"F704H_180","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/f704h_340","id":"F704H_340","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/f704h-medical-high-dependency","id":"f704h-medical-high-dependency","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/f704h-sdu","id":"F704H-sdu","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/embarrassed","id":"embarrassed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/copd","id":"copd"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diet","id":"diet"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/discharge","id":"discharge"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dressing","id":"dressing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kind","id":"kind"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/level%20of%20care","id":"level of care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nursing%20care","id":"nursing care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/oxygen","id":"oxygen"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/physio","id":"physio"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/respiratory","id":"respiratory"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/undignified","id":"undignified"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/walking","id":"walking"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/weight","id":"weight"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cheerful","id":"cheerful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/noisy%20ward","id":"noisy ward"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1073177","id":"1073177"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1076291","id":"1076291"}]},{"id":1072054,"author":"phipper","authorRoleId":3,"authorRole":"a parent/guardian","title":"Rude receptionist","body":"We found the the receptionist very rude.

The helpful staff member appeared extremely upset at being humiliated in front of a patient and immediately got up and left the office  \r\nI asked them later if the person was a volunteer and was told no.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-05-29T12:03:29.9133333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-06-01T08:15:14.6","readBy":[{"name":"Dorset County Hospital NHS Foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1072140","id":"1072140"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1072140/responses","id":"1072140"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1072140/healthservices","id":"1072140"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1072140/tags","id":"1072140"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rbd01_110","id":"RBD01_110","score":3},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/angry","id":"angry"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hand","id":"hand"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/orthopaedic","id":"orthopaedic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/receptionist","id":"receptionist"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/rudeness","id":"rudeness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/section","id":"section"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attitude","id":"staff attitude"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1080508","id":"1080508"}]},{"id":1072176,"author":"David23","authorRoleId":4,"authorRole":"a relative","title":"Support at home","body":"Linsay from the Reach team came out as my mum was having mobility difficulties at home.  \r\nShe was friendly, knowledgeable, caring and compassionate and arranged several different aids to help make things easier at home.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-05-29T13:40:31.85","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-06-01T08:17:18.993","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Forth Valley","count":2},{"name":"Falkirk Health & Social Care Partnership","count":7}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1072176","id":"1072176"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1072176/responses","id":"1072176"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1072176/healthservices","id":"1072176"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1072176/tags","id":"1072176"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/s37000013-fch-reach","id":"S37000013-fch-reach","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/advice","id":"advice"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/aids","id":"AIDS"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/better","id":"better"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/caring","id":"caring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/knowledgeable","id":"knowledgeable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mobility","id":"mobility"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/understanding","id":"understanding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassionate","id":"compassionate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported","id":"supported"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1073184","id":"1073184"}]},{"id":1072851,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Poor experience ","body":"I recently attended a&e personally for first time due to severe pain for a week.\nWe waited 4.5hr as busy so although frustrating/in pain I accepted this.

She was seen promptly and the nurses and support workers were great in helping my daughter feel at ease. Warmth and understanding at every stage. The wait for our surgery slot was made easier by a well equipped and varied playroom and play coordinator which helped keep our Daughter from becoming too anxious. It was evident that the unit was well led by the kind charge nurse and staff enjoyed their jobs. Freddie the surgeon and his team also examined, explained and approached with such care and friendliness. A great experience which we don’t often face with a child who has invisible and often misunderstood needs.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-05-30T06:09:16.53","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-06-01T08:43:17.123","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lothian","count":9}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1072261","id":"1072261"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1072261/responses","id":"1072261"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1072261/healthservices","id":"1072261"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1072261/tags","id":"1072261"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/s225h-crw","id":"S225H-CrW","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anaesthetic","id":"Anaesthetic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/asd","id":"ASD"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/eye","id":"eye"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/eye%20examination","id":"Eye examination"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/level%20of%20care","id":"level of care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/prompt","id":"prompt"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgeon","id":"surgeon"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/understanding","id":"understanding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendliness","id":"friendliness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20ease","id":"at ease"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1074856","id":"1074856"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1079558","id":"1079558"}]},{"id":1072868,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Unable to make followup appt, 30mins hold no…","body":"Had a good session with physio.

I explained my problem as briefly as possible and told him that there was no need to ring back if the department couldn’t help. I didn’t want to take any more of their valuable time. Dr Beverland had to refer my query to one of the Consultant Immunologists. I am not sure if Dr Devlin , Dr Coulter or some other senior member of staff approved my request. Dr Beverland relayed my query very accurately and I received a letter with exactly the information I required.  \r\nI am very thankful to Angela, Dr Beverland and all the staff in the immunology department who support me as I navigate my health issues.

Perhaps 'management' need reminding that the service is funded by clients taxes and is not 'free' and therefore in their gift to provide services as and when they like.\nI accept the pressure the NHS is under, however this practise could at least soften its telephone messaging and at least try to give a better impression of providing a community health service.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2023-05-30T10:50:59","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-06-01T09:02:25","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1072873","id":"1072873"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1072873/responses","id":"1072873"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1072873/healthservices","id":"1072873"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1072873/tags","id":"1072873"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/j82051","id":"J82051","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/better","id":"better"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/content","id":"content"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/delivery","id":"delivery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gift","id":"gift"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doing%20well","id":"doing well"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/under%20pressure","id":"under pressure"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/like%20myself","id":"like myself"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1075473","id":"1075473"}]},{"id":1072871,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Post Op ","body":"Had mvd surgery in 2020.

Unfortunately they had no emergency appointments so I decided to try a local optician. I was surprised that they were open. A very helpful receptionist took the details . She explained that she needed to ask a few triage questions. She listened carefully and was reassuring.  \r\nShortly afterwards an optician called Laura phoned back. She explained that my husband needed urgent attention and said that she would make time to see him.

She put in pain relief drops and prepared his eyes so that they would be ready for examination at Altnagelvin Hospital. He was given a letter to bring to the emergency eye clinic at the hospital.

The midwives and admin staff, not happy with her being mask-exempt, treated her as if she had covid or the plague, very rude toward her also. The staff on the day of the c-section and the antenatal ward were not happy being near her due to not wearing mask as she is exempt.  \r\nShe then reached out to the mental health midwife during the pregnancy but was offered no help. She was late in receiving antibiotics for an infection in her c-section wound.  \r\nRefused entry into the GP practice for a check up with our son. Then she moved practice, to still be not allowed entry due to not wearing a mask, even though being mask-exempt, and also told by receptionist that they refused to speak to her because her surname was different to our son's.  \r\nSo she removed herself from the GP practice altogether. The GP didn't try to stop this even though she was on the waiting list for the mental health team, which is a complete failure in the duty of care, in my eyes.  \r\nA new health visitor was sent out to the house again due to my partner being mask-exempt. The health visitor told her to stay back from them, even though there was a good bit between them and they were at the front door - the health visitor had no mask on by the way. The health visitor was upset at the attitude (non-existing) shown by my partner, went and reported to the GP even though no longer a registered patient, social services were called for no reason at all.  \r\nHad called the mental health team in the hospital due to feeling suicidal, was told by the nurse to ring lifeline instead.  \r\nNot being able to attend appointments with either of our children, our daughter's speech and language appointments or vaccinations for either children, due to not being registered with a GP and being mask-exempt. GP also not willing to talk or discuss the children with partner due her not being registered with a GP practice.  \r\nTold her problems will go away once registered again with a GP practice.  \r\nNot one person she has spoke to within the health care system believed any of these experiences during COVID 19 were true. Made to feel it was all in her head.  \r\nI really hope this is published as this site is for everyone to share their experiences whether good or bad.

I had to resort to the frankly useless NHS app to show nurses at the hospital which tests the surgery had ordered, and what the results were. Prior to that, a consultant had to write to the surgery with some urgency, asking them to commence treatment for one condition, in order that I could be treated by the hospital for another.\nOne thing I am certain of, no-one at the surgery would want their health issues dealt with in such a haphazard fashion. How difficult can it be to phone or email a hospital department and coordinate treatment? Why do they rely on something as fallible as a patient, who is not a medical professional, to do it for them? Something as simple as a repeat prescription takes days to process. How can that be called effective or efficient, or even an improvement on what went before? The information screens in the waiting room fall well short of what they ought to. The receptionists try their best, but the layout of the room does not help them. Neither does it assist the medicos to have to come to reception and call the patients' names. Not at all 21st century, is it?\nI could go on at even greater length, but why should I?

It has become so bad, we actually ended up in A&E due to the physical symptoms she has been experiencing. Even her consultant who sees her for coeliac disease got involved and referred her to CAHMS with a view to being prescribed medication to help her to cope. CAHMS themselves say they strongly suspect she suffers from Autism. Yet she has a 2 year wait to be assessed for this. Despite all this, and the fact that her nervousness and anxiety is now affecting her college application, we have had a letter this week telling us CAHMS is not accepting the referral! They say she’s on a waiting list for Base51 counselling and that should be enough. The truth is we’ve had our initial assessment this month, and they’ve said it will be several months before we hear from them again! This is not helping at all!  \r\nThis is getting to the point now where I’m considering getting a solicitor involved and taking legal action, as this is seriously affecting her career prospects, not to mention the fact she is suffering so much. She can’t even bring herself to apply for a Saturday job due to her struggles, and we have found CAHMS absolutely awful in their support towards her. At the one meeting she had, she came away very upset as she felt ‘blamed’ for not doing the CBT she was given months before. But in actual fact, when her motivation is zero due to depression, this stops this from happening. Feeling blamed has completely turned her against the CBT.  \r\nTo now be refused any further help or medication is insulting. It’s as though no one believes her when she says she feels the way she does. CAHMS seem to be neglecting her needs and dismissing my concerns about her mental health. It should not be this hard to get support! You’re told to not be scared to ask for it, but when you do, you get dismissed!","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-05-30T07:59:12.9933333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-06-01T09:35:05.177","readBy":[{"name":"Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust","count":5}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1072269","id":"1072269"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1072269/responses","id":"1072269"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1072269/healthservices","id":"1072269"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1072269/tags","id":"1072269"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rha-camhs-city","id":"rha-camhs-city","score":1},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/angry","id":"angry"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frustrated","id":"frustrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ignored","id":"ignored"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20listened%20to","id":"not listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/autism","id":"autism"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cbt","id":"cbt"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/coeliac","id":"coeliac"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/counselling","id":"counselling"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/depression","id":"depression"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dismissed","id":"dismissed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lack%20of%20support","id":"lack of support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unhelpful","id":"unhelpful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting%20times","id":"waiting times"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/like%20a%20nuisance","id":"like a nuisance"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/help%20and%20support","id":"help and support"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1074897","id":"1074897"}]},{"id":1072922,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Continuing Excellent Practice ","body":"As always at Werrington and at Peterborough a prompt, efficient, thorough and confidence boosting service always restores faith in the NHS .

There is no other way for this to happen except under general anaesthetic.  \r\nThe care and support we received on the day was amazing but even more exceptional was the work done in the background on the lead up to the day which meant it was the best experience for our son as it possibly could be. Ensuring he was first into the ward, had his own room, everything was kept calm, and the staff went with whatever worked for him. They were prepared to give him an alternative pre-med having read his notes and seen one he had previously hadn't worked. He was also first on the list so we didn't need to wait any longer than was necessary for him to be taken to theatre.  \r\nAll through the day the staff were all brilliant, taking our lead, keeping the environment as calm and settled for our son as possible. We don't know all the names of the staff who support our son, the dentist was Jill and the procedure took place at the at the start of May 2023. We would love it if those who supported our son were recognised for the wonderful work they do and that they know how much we, as a family, appreciated them.  \r\nIn addition, when we first knew our son would need to go into hospital and be under general anaesthetic his own dentist, Gillian, who is based at the Royal Alexandra Hospital dental department, asked us if there was anything else we would want done. We asked about a hair cut and later about the possibility of giving him a vaccine he hadn't had. These might seem straightforward things but to a child like our son, who is now a teenager, big and strong it is impossible to get anywhere near him to do things he doesn't want to. We hadn't been able to cut his hair for 3 years and he hadn't had any vaccinations since he was 5yrs old.  \r\nWe don't know who, but somebody in the NHS arranged for a professional hairdresser to be in theatre with our son that day, the anaesthetist give him the HPV vaccine he hadn't been able to have and the dentist even cut his finger and toe nails. We would love if someone could find out who the wonderful person was who arranged for the hairdresser, and say a massive thank you from us. The hairdresser, herself did an amazing job, our boy looked so handsome when we got him back from theatre and for all the staff in theatre who we didn't meet on the day for working round all of this going on, just to make our son's and our lives just a little bit better, we truly can't thank them all enough.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-05-30T13:58:42.6933333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-06-01T10:14:31.32","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":15}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1072415","id":"1072415"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1072415/responses","id":"1072415"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1072415/healthservices","id":"1072415"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1072415/tags","id":"1072415"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/c418h-dental","id":"C418H-dental","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sj9-children-dental","id":"sj9-children-dental","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/all%20staff","id":"all staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anaesthetic","id":"Anaesthetic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/autistic","id":"autistic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/calmness","id":"calmness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care%20and%20support","id":"Care and support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care%20planning","id":"care planning"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dental","id":"dental"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hair","id":"hair"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/learning%20difficulties","id":"learning difficulties"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nails","id":"nails"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/positive%20experience","id":"positive experience"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thoughtful","id":"thoughtful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wonderful","id":"wonderful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20thankful","id":"very thankful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hpv%20vaccine","id":"hpv vaccine"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1073286","id":"1073286"}]},{"id":1072442,"author":"chamaeleonfx34","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"It felt like VIP treatment!","body":"I had an operation on my lower eyelid, at the Mater hospital in Belfast today.
