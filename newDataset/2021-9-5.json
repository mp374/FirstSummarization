It is basic knowledge to know a bit about the patient in order to help treat them, this makes the patient feel at ease to know your doctor is aware about your medical history. \n\nUnderstandably due to covid everything is a telephone consultation, however some rules can be put in place for a patient to be seen by a GP if absolutely necessary. \n\nThe Phone lines and appointment system is also terrible, Seems to me nothing is properly organised. \n\nHow on earth do they expect over 1000 patients to be calling at 8.00am be held in a queue to get an appointment by 8.30am. \n\nWhen you finally get through the appointments are all gone for that whole day. \n\nThey don’t even have a afternoon timing to call which makes no sense, there are working people who cannot call at 8.00am and as everything is a telephone appt you can’t book online either, slots are blocked! It like a never ending nightmare! \n\nClearly there is a lot of faults with this practice and a lot needs to change in order for things to run smoothly and for a patients care to be prioritised.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2021-09-03T17:39:24","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2021-09-05T06:42:24","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/875505","id":"875505"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/875505/responses","id":"875505"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/875505/healthservices","id":"875505"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/875505/tags","id":"875505"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/f82621","id":"F82621","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appalling","id":"appalling"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confused","id":"confused"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/shocked","id":"shocked"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/terrible","id":"terrible"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/feel%20at%20ease","id":"feel at ease"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20ease","id":"at ease"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/prioritised","id":"prioritised"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid","id":"covid"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%2019","id":"covid 19"}]},{"id":875504,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Impossible to Contact.!!!","body":"Dreadful dreadful dreadful, impossible to contact by phone, was no.19 in the queue, updated as my position rise to number 3 and then a continual loop of music, have been waiting one hour and twenty minutes to be answered...

I arrived at 12:45pm for a 1pm appointment and was seen pretty much straight away. After the scan the sonographer informed me I had to have a review by the doctor and to register at the ANDU desk for this. I handed in my notes and was asked to be seated. Fast forward to 3pm, a very busy waiting room full of expectant mothers all waiting to see a GP and not one of us had been called. At this point I was getting a little frustrated and anxious so I enquired in regards to my appointment and the wait. I was told I was 3rd in the pile and the doctor was on dinner. I had to await a further hour until eventually I was called in, only to be told I didn't really need to wait as I already have an induction booked and just to plan and come back for that.\n\nFeel really let down that it has taken near 3 hours for a doctor to review my notes, only to tell me I need to await my induction and to go home. On top of all that she wasn't even sure why I was booked an induction in the first place. When I explained she told me that I mught as well have it anyway as I'm 39 weeks. I complained in regards to the wait time as without my husband (who had to wait in the car) I had got worked up and anxious, and the doctor just told me they are short staffed Friday and that was that.\n\nLots of women in the same position as me and some waited longer. I think the whole system needs to be reviewed and reconsidered, especially during COVID. Not happy with the service one bit.

I spoke to the nicest receptionist over the telephone you could ever wish for. Her mannerism, understanding and helpfulness was second to none. She explained that my husbands details would be passed on  and if he needed to be seen she would ring me back.( she had already given us app for October). To be honest due to my husband having ongoing health issues this problem with his eyes was very worrying.  The receptionist reassured me. This very helpful lady is called Helen and I hope these comments are passed on. She rang myself back and we got appointment at 3pm, which was just superb. On attending we were myself and my husband who's vision was impaired  had first class service all equipment fully cleaned due to my husband having no immunity,  this was a worry but didn't need to worry, all aspects explained. The lady who did the eye test was fab even put us in a little room on our own due to my husband having no immunity.

","body":"I wouldn't recommend anyone go to this hospital at all. I went to A&E on Monday night after having a fall the triage nurses were absolutely lovely and really understanding but that's where it started and ended. I was eventually seen by a doctor who took me for an X-ray after my X-ray I was just dumped outside the doors of CDU and left there until the doctor came back to see me. I was then taken somewhere else where the same doctor put me in a room and told me that I could sit in either the bed or the chair bearing in mind I had just been told that I had a broken ankle and foot the doctor walked away and left me sat in the wheelchair with no breaks on it and I had to struggle to get myself out of the chair and on to the bed at one point the chair moved whilst I was trying to stand up. I then had 2 lovely nurses come in to see me but the nurse who took a blood sample from left the needle that she had used in the bed with me. I was then moved to another room and just left with no clue what was going on. The next day I was past from one place to another at one point I was put on a ward where my bag had been left wide open on a bed with my phone and everything on show it had been taken from where I was staying and just left on a bed. I had an incredibly rude consultant who decided to reposition my fractured ankle without any painkillers and then had the nerve to turn round and say to me you don't want surgery do you when I'm screaming in pain because he was squeezing and twisting my ankle he made me feel like an inconvenience-no bedside manner what so ever. I was then put on CDU where I had a nurse shout at me from across the room to find out what my name was and how you spell it I had to ask twice for painkillers and never got any. Physio came and watched me walk with crutches for 2 seconds and then just left when I was trying to get back to the bed I could've fallen but that didn't matter to them. I was then just thrown out of the hospital no one knew if I had someone picking me up I was just wheeled outside of A&E and left sat there in a wheelchair in the cold on my own at no point did any ask if there was someone coming for me I was just thrown outside like I didn't matter. I wouldn't let my worst enemy go to this hospital. You are not a patient you are just an inconvenience that they want to be rid of as soon as possible.

It was 10 pm on a Friday night. I was prepared for a 4+ hour wait and a chaotic environment. \nIt was a little disconcerting having to wait in a slow queue to get in the door, but when I did I realised why. They have a dr immediately on entering that assesses the issue in order to expedite appropriate treatment and ensure people get to the right place from the outset.\nI was directed to a GP in the major injuries dept ( I think). I waited 10 mins max before being called through.\nReally good young female Dr, listened to my problems and then called the relevant specialist ( maxilla facial dept) who arrived within minutes. Another really great young female Dr. They were both helpful, kind and I felt safe, reassured and listened to. The maxilla Dr was particularly helpful to me, she helped me understand why I was in so much pain and offered good advice and reassurance. Honestly I was really pathetically grateful for all the staff last night. They are doing a tough, dangerous tiring job and remain upbeat, compassionate and professional. \nI understand local community GPS are not able/ willing to see patients but really…are they at any more risk from covid than all the staff last night? I do suspect A&E are a lot busier than they need to be, driven by the fact pretty much no one can see a GP locally.\nPlease pass on my extreme gratitude to your outstanding staff, it does make a real difference to visitors at a distressing scary time.

I saw a nurse and a GP. I asked both to help me with my sling , neither did. The GP said he would go grab my prescription, 1.5 hours later I was still sat, in tears at this point, waiting for some pain relief. My husband came in and went to ring someone, he approached a member of staff who was on Facebook messenger walking through the department. \nI understand A&E was busy on this visit but I feel basic care needs were not met.

At first I didn’t even understand they were a security guard. I tried to ask them what they wanted from me, but apparently the authority and entitlement of their position protects them from treating their fellow human beings with anything close to decency, so they just looked at me with disdain. They picked through my bag as if it was filled with something unpleasant. When they wanded me, they didn’t even direct me to lift my arms etc… they just expected me to understand. I expect this security guard relishes the opportunity to retaliate against anyone who presents as a troublemaker, so deliberately behaves this way to incite trouble.\nAll this security guard needed to do was introduce himself and say “I need to do a security check for the wellbeing of the staff and other visitors.” I suggest they be directed towards a new line of work as a bailiff or a prison officer.

The buildings are kept beautifully clean and all the staff from the humblest cleaner had a cherry smile for everyone. The food was excellent and they could even read minds and bring a cup of tea and biscuit at the right moment. All the nurses on Ward 18 went way and beyond expectations. No one ever seems to have an off day. I was in for a new knee and I took it for granted that the surgeon, was a man at the peak of his profession to hold the job at Airedale. What I discovered was the extras that came with his abilities. I was treated as an individual. He spent time talking to me to allay all my fears. He was obviously a great team motivator, he conveyed a calm air, everyone knew their job and worked together. His anesthetist I single out for particular praise, he really looked after me by my side every minute during the operation. The surgeon said to me when I was on the operating table that the only surprise I would get was when I was told the job was finished. He was right, absolutely no pain. Thanks.

A useful leaflet was enclosed with the appointment letter which is really important to read beforehand as it explains everything about the scan. The injection was painless, the scan quiet and he was comfortable during the process. We now have a proper diagnosis which took about 3 weeks to come through and Dad is now being prescribed the appropriate medication.

While this was not urgent, the doctor felt that a spurt was damaging her heart valve. This surgery would be via keyhole surgery in Dublin and the appointment and information given all went well.  \r\nIn May 2021 I was contacted via Belfast to ask me to bring my daughter to Dublin in 7 days time. After organising emergency leave from my job as a teacher and alternative childcare arrangements for my other 2 daughters to allow my husband to come, we were informed on Thursday that the surgery on the following Tuesday was cancelled. The reason for this was given as the Cyber attack on the Irish healthcare system. At the time I understood these exceptional circumstances and I was assured my daughter was top of the list and would be contacted soon. We then ensured that required faecal samples were up to date.  \r\nIn July 2021, the day before my mother passed away from cancer, I received a phone call this time directly from Dublin asking me to bring my daughter in. Given the circumstances it was agreed that she would be put on the surgery list for a week later with the proviso that this could be cancelled due to an emergency. What followed from here was, and still is, a catalogue of poor communication between Dublin, Belfast and myself.  \r\nI had to contact Emma in Belfast directly who was very helpful and organised COVID tests and a hotel room. they sent out a useful information pack, although it was clearly written for pre COVID operations and I was disappointed that it wasn’t clear what changes COVID would make.  \r\nHeartbeat Trust were also helpful in giving advice about car parks and available resources in Crumlin Children’s Hospital.  \r\nA few days before the operation, I contacted Dublin early the morning to be told that my daughter’s surgery was cancelled due to emergencies and a limited surgery list. It was unclear at what time I might have been informed of this. I contacted Belfast to inform Emma to cancel the hotel, my husband Knockbracken to cancel our COVID tests and then I cancelled my childcare arrangements. Finally I had to inform my 5 year old that, for the second time, the doctor couldn’t fix her heart this week. In the meantime she was put down for another date in the coming weeks.  \r\nAt 2:00pm a few days before the new operation date, I confirmed the hotel and COVID tests with Emma and then received a phone from Dublin saying that, due to a limited surgery list and emergencies, My daughter’s operation was cancelled. I rang Belfast, COVID test centre, childcare and then told my daughter for the third time that her heart couldn’t be fixed. She was put on the surgery list for a week later.  \r\nDuring the week I heard nothing from anyone regarding surgery. On Friday I telephoned Dublin for information but there was no answer despite several calls. The previous week we had been told the surgery would proceed and we would be telephoned the day before the operation with details of admission. We proceeded with our COVID tests, packed our bags, prepped our daughters for staying away and My daughter for her operation. I telephoned Dublin at 10:30am, just to be sure, where I was informed that the reason no one had taken my call due to holidays.  \r\nOf course, this is expected at this time of year but I’m so disappointed that no one else took over our case during this time , contacted us or answered our calls. We were then informed that the operation was cancelled again. This time it was because the surgeon was absent this week so the operation could not happen. I then had to ring Emma to cancel the hotel and tell my daughter for the 4th time that we couldn’t get her heart fixed.  \r\nI am so disappointed at the reason for this cancellation as I cannot understand how we were put on a surgery list of a surgeon who wouldn't be there. Nor do I understand why no one contacted us at any point to tell us this. I wonder when Dublin would have contacted me had I not telephoned. I was told I would be contacted regarding confirmation of surgery for next month following a meeting but I received no phone call. While on the phone to Emma I reiterated that this situation is very difficult for us as a family and she was understanding. As a teacher my holiday period will end on 12/8 and my daughter is due to start school on 27/8. My husband’s work have been told he will be on holiday 3 times and have been flexible in allowing this to cancelled but their tolerance is naturally waning.  \r\nIn the meantime I feel that I cannot risk taking my family to any crowded areas in case anyone gets COVID which would result in cancellation. We have not celebrated 2 birthdays due to bereavement and the ongoing surgery issues and have not taken any time away this summer. I am a tolerant person and understand well the pressures our healthcare is under. I realise that emergencies can happen and there is always a risk of cancellation. However, this escapade of 4 cancellations, particularly this last one, and lack of communication has left me at the end of my tether. I can’t risk cancelling but the cycle of this system we are in at the minute is quite unbelievable.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-07-26T23:43:26.2","progress":"Change planned","dateOfPublication":"2021-09-06T08:22:15.363","readBy":[{"name":"Belfast Health and Social Care Trust","count":19},{"name":"Patient and Client Council","count":1},{"name":"Public Health Agency","count":1},{"name":"Ulster University, Faculty of Life and Health Sciences","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/865883","id":"865883"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/865883/responses","id":"865883"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/865883/healthservices","id":"865883"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/865883/tags","id":"865883"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt001_11023_320","id":"ZT001_11023_320","score":0},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/angry","id":"angry"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxious","id":"anxious"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frustrated","id":"frustrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sad","id":"sad"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/worried","id":"worried"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/accommodating","id":"accommodating"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/answering%20phones","id":"answering phones"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appointment%20system","id":"appointment system"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cancelled%20operation","id":"cancelled operation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication%20between%20services","id":"communication between services"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/despondent","id":"despondent"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disrespected","id":"disrespected"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/efficient","id":"efficient"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/heart%20valve%20surgery","id":"Heart valve surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helpful","id":"helpful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/understanding","id":"understanding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vsd","id":"VSD"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/family%20kept%20informed","id":"family kept informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20disappointed","id":"very disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/information%20leaflet","id":"information leaflet"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/access%20to%20operation","id":"access to operation"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/879534","id":"879534"}]},{"id":875627,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Very patient ","body":"Had a mri today and I’m extremely claustrophobic.

I can understand them running a little late, especially at the end of the day, but more than an hour is not really on, especially as there was no communication about the delay either. Luckily I did not have any plans after my appointment today, but had the appointment been booked earlier on in the day, perhaps during my lunch break at work for example, then I simply would not have been able to attend if it was over an hour late and would have had no choice but to miss it and re-book.

Very few of the doctors work more than 2 days per week, Registrars and newly qualified GPs are only with the surgery for short periods and there is a high turnover of locums. \n\nOn a practical level, the greater part of any appointment with a different GP is spent going through the history which often leaves very little time to deal with the issue itself. This makes the management of the feel very disjointed and inconsistent - particularly when one GP takes a different approach to any of the previous ones. \n\nAnd on a personal level, it means there is no opportunity to build up a relationship and each new appointment feels very perfunctory. It's more like attending a large hospital than a local community practice.\n\n[NB. I don't mind the shift towards remote appointments and use of the App and texts. I don't think that, in itself, impersonalises the service. Most of the feedback on this has been negative, but for a lot of people it saves having to take time off work getting to and from the surgery]\n\n\n","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2021-09-04T13:01:39","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-09-06T09:06:12","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/875638","id":"875638"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/875638/responses","id":"875638"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/875638/healthservices","id":"875638"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/875638/tags","id":"875638"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/d81010","id":"D81010","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/periods","id":"periods"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/888063","id":"888063"}]},{"id":875637,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"No Communication","body":"Was recommended to arrive @A&E by Vision Express by 2PM then they would forward my son to the Minors to be assessed by a opthalmology specialist.
