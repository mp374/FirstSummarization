My wife removed the stitches on day 5 using a stitch cutter that we bought from Amazon.  \r\nOne final comment: my local general practice is 10 mins away and there’s ample parking: the hospital is 45 mins away and there is no parking.

It turned out the radiographer had assumed my mum was a minor injuries patient, when she had been referred by her GP, and she shouldn’t have been asked to wait as the results will be passed to her GP. Another radiographer then turned up to explain the results of the x-ray, which they proceeded to do in front of a full waiting room. I complained that there was no privacy and they then found a side room, but insisted on stating that they weren't divulging any sensitive information.  \r\nMe and my mother found the whole experience unnecessarily time-consuming, frustrating and the way in which my mum was dealt with was unprofessional.

Reception staff warned me wait for treatment could be hours, answered my questions, were professional, lovely. Wait was only 90 mins. People who came in after me were seen before me because their injuries were more serious, as is only right. The nurse I saw was wonderful — efficient, quickly cleaned my wound, gave me Tetanus injection, antibiotics, dressings for next few days. Told me what to look for over next 72 hours. Asked me if I had questions, which is excellent. All of these steps will seem routine and obvious to most, but I must stress how great it is to have efficient treatment, with empathy, eye contact and clear communication. How did I feel? Hugely, sincerely grateful to all the staff — thank you. Deeply sympathetic at the underfunding, under-resourcing of the NHS. If anyone’s listening, please pay them more.  \r\nBy contrast, a 95-year-old man was sitting in a wheelchair in pyjamas and dressing gown, with bare feet, just inside the main door. After 30 mins his daughter arrived and tried to find out where his taxi was. She had to go to the intercom at the clinical access door and say all this — everyone waiting heard all the details. A nurse came out and phoned to chase up the taxi. They’d been told it would be there in two minutes, but 30 minutes later it wasn’t. If it was due in two minutes, could someone not have stayed with him till it arrived? If his daughter had not been able to be there, what would have happened? Should someone not check on patient pickups, at least for vulnerable patients?","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-08-30T19:20:36.3166667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-09-01T09:25:07.283","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":7}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/970927","id":"970927"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/970927/responses","id":"970927"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/970927/healthservices","id":"970927"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/970927/tags","id":"970927"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/c418h_180","id":"C418H_180","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/advice","id":"advice"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/antibiotics","id":"antibiotics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dog%20bite","id":"dog bite"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dressings","id":"dressings"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/efficient","id":"efficient"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/empathy","id":"empathy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/injection","id":"injection"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lovely%20staff","id":"lovely staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurse","id":"nurse"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professional","id":"professional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/taxi","id":"taxi"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tetanus","id":"tetanus"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wonderful","id":"wonderful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reception%20staff","id":"reception staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lack%20of%20privacy","id":"lack of privacy"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/974186","id":"974186"}]},{"id":971172,"author":"frostyt76","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"I could not fault any of the team","body":"From start to finish, the staff and doctor was brilliant at VHK Kirkcaldy.

He was 18 at the time he was suffering with pins and needles in his hands and feet. He collapsed and was taken to hospital, as first he was diagnosed with a vitamin deficiency, but he continued to get worse. He was losing weight rapidly, just under 3 stone in a month.  \r\nAfter numerous tests he was diagnosed with Guillian-Barre Syndrome. This was a shock to all involved.Whilst in Wishaw Hospital he received IVIg transfusions which we thought was the start of his slow recovery.  \r\nAfter being discharged we started to get in the community physio from Coathill Hospital. This was an absolute godsend. The girls that came to our house were fantastic, one in particular. When my son seemed to be getting weaker she noticed this straight away, and within the hour we were back in hospital.  \r\nMore transfusions and a further 2-week stay in Wishaw. The staff were attentive and amazing. Once home, the physio commenced, which was fantastic, the relationship, the empathy and compassion they had was exactly what we needed.  \r\nWe have been told his condition can take months to go away, but he is making great progress. He has to learn to walk again, he is on crutches at the moment, taking steady steps.  \r\nWe have had one horrific year, but we are beginning to see the light. Without the community physio I don’t know where we would be today.I wanted to share our story as a family and thank the NHS.

The staff nurse who looked after me was super, and acted as an advocate for me in maintaining my confidentiality.  \r\nBoth of them were excellent. After surgery I was moved to ward 4B, where I received exceptional care in the four days I was there. Nurse George was brilliant, as were all the members of staff I came into contact with. I thanked sister Alma for all the great care and attention. They have an amazing team. I am still being followed up by consultant orthopaedic surgeon, Ms Murphy, and all her team at the fracture clinic.  \r\nI am just in\" AWE\".

In August last year I was also admitted with acute cholecystectomy, and again I had the very same experience in the Medical Ward.  \r\nIn this day and age I think people are too quick to criticize, and I just felt the need to sing the praises of Causeway Hospital and the wonderful staff, and give them all a real big thank you.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-08-31T13:43:01.5233333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-09-01T10:56:28.093","readBy":[{"name":"Northern Health and Social Care Trust","count":9},{"name":"Patient and Client Council","count":1},{"name":"Public Health Agency","count":1},{"name":"Ulster University, Faculty of Life and Health Sciences","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/971244","id":"971244"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/971244/responses","id":"971244"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/971244/healthservices","id":"971244"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/971244/tags","id":"971244"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt002_21028_502","id":"ZT002_21028_502","score":5},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt002-ch-surgical-2","id":"zt002-ch-surgical-2","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cholecystectomy","id":"cholecystectomy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/food","id":"food"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gynae","id":"gynae"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/laparoscopic%20cholecystectomy","id":"Laparoscopic cholecystectomy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/level%20of%20care","id":"level of care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professional","id":"professional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/relaxed","id":"relaxed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wonderful%20staff","id":"wonderful staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/acute%20medical%20care","id":"acute medical care"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/971484","id":"971484"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/971543","id":"971543"}]},{"id":971449,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Needs changes ","body":"I joined this surgery about 6 years ago due to moving house. They lost prescriptions, medication ect and I can't say I've had a good experience since the beginning. I recently fell down the stairs. I did an e-consult and explained the pain I was in as I'd injured my coccyx bone. A doctor didn't even contact me themselves and automatically booked me an appointment to physio. I rang the practice and explained I needed painkillers for the pain and was told if that's what the doctor said then that's what needed to happen. Due to the lack of support, I had to attend a&e. The doctor there agreed I should not have been referred to physio as the back problem was from a fall not a long term issue and that they should have prescribed pain killers. Fast forward 2 weeks, I'm still in pain and I can feel the bone moving. I am quite scared about it as it is my spine. I filled in another e-consult on Sunday 29th August and was told a doctor would be in touch by Wednesday 31st at 6:30pm. I rang the practice at 5:15pm on Wednesday to be told my econsult was still being processed and I wasn't on any list for a telephone appointment. I asked her if she  could speak to a doctor and ask them why my case wasn't looked at yet. She said she couldn't because all doctors had gone home.  Whoever is in charge of this practice needs to review it. Its impossible to get a face to face appointment with your doctor, you need to book a day off work for an appointment as you aren't given a time and they need ro reviiew their e-consult system as its obviously not up to standards. This isn't the first time this has happened to me and I've gone a week before waiting for a doctor to contact me. It's not good enough and this practice is adding to the problem a&e and dealing with.

I feel very lucky to have people like this taking care of the ongoing treatment I receive for osteoarthritis of my knees.  \r\nThank you, MCDU.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-08-31T16:55:45.5","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-09-01T11:30:43.323","readBy":[{"name":"South Eastern Health and Social Care Trust","count":5},{"name":"Public Health Agency","count":1},{"name":"Ulster University, Faculty of Life and Health Sciences","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/971295","id":"971295"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/971295/responses","id":"971295"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/971295/healthservices","id":"971295"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/971295/tags","id":"971295"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt004_07021-mdcu","id":"zt004_07021-mdcu","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/consultant","id":"consultant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/knees","id":"knees"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lucky","id":"lucky"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurse","id":"nurse"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/osteoarthritis","id":"osteoarthritis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professional","id":"professional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/welcoming","id":"welcoming"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/relaxed","id":"relaxed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wonderful%20staff","id":"wonderful staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/steroid%20injections","id":"steroid injections"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20ease","id":"at ease"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/972029","id":"972029"}]},{"id":971465,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"excellent service","body":"I called into the pharmacy to check out a minor problem , was advised to be seen by the surgery.

This is not part of my complaint which relates to failure by NHS Lanarkshire to provide me with treatment based upon the past two visits in June 2022 and August 2022. I still don’t have the outcome of my blood levels today.  \r\nMy complaint relates to the past two visits to receive treatments in Haematology. I attended the last appointment in June to have my bloods checked. The procedure is to check bloods and depending upon the outcome see if I require a venesection. In June the nurse stated my levels were good, I didn’t need a venesection and I would be sent a new appointment in the post.Time passed and I contacted the day unit to say I should be due a return visit. They said I had missed an appointment in early August. They spoke with the nurse in charge and I was given an appointment for yesterday at 3:30pm. I can confirm I do not miss or fail to turn up to my appointments.I arrived at 3.20pm. The nurse who greeted me said that my bloods were good and they just required checking today. I asked how they knew this as my bloods were last checked today in June. They advised that once my bloods were checked I would be advised on levels. I explained that I wait for the results and then if required a venesection is carried out. They said that this is not what they has been advised to do. At my request they clarified this with the consultant and asked that I return to the waiting area. They then returned to say come in and we will get started. I had suggested based upon how I was feeling and the time of day that bloods be taken and venesection started After about 5 minutes and before the blood was removed the charge nurse approached and said they had bad news. They advised that as I had not had my bloods checked since June and based upon the time of day it would be unsafe to carry out this procedure. I asked for an explanation as the timescales between my visits have been longer in the past and the procedure has been carried out. I advised that the risk for me is not doing the treatment as it was last carried out in June. It seems clear that the ability to carry out the treatment was due to the fact that blood taken at 3:39pm may not return before the unit closes at 4:30pm. I stated that if bloods are returned in 20 minutes there is still enough time for venesections to be carried out and I failed to recognise any risk to me. I have had venesection and treatments in the same clinic before. They advised it was a decision made by a senior nurse, which I strongly disagreed with. Why would you bring me into an appointment at 3:30pm if you are not able to provide the necessary care and treatment?  \r\nI normally make my complaint to the managers at University Hospital in Wishaw however their priority appears to be discharge and targets and not ensuring I access the treatment I require .  \r\nThe health professional that saw me in June did not confirm my blood levels but on checking yesterday they were at the recommended level to carry out a venesection. They also failed to ensure my appointment was made, placing me at risk. This is not acceptable nor is it appropriate for me to take two days from work when the treatment can be carried out in one visit, even if this requires me to attend both morning and afternoon clinics.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-08-31T13:44:10.8133333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-09-01T12:18:18.95","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lanarkshire","count":4}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/971245","id":"971245"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/971245/responses","id":"971245"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/971245/healthservices","id":"971245"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/971245/tags","id":"971245"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l308h_303","id":"L308H_303","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20test","id":"blood test"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20tests","id":"blood tests"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/consistency","id":"consistency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/haematology","id":"haematology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/planning","id":"planning"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/process","id":"process"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/venesection","id":"venesection"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/previous%20care","id":"previous care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disgusted%20and%20upset","id":"disgusted and upset"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/971919","id":"971919"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/972520","id":"972520"}]},{"id":969773,"author":"barnbloo","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Accessing primary care","body":"Cannot get appointment in under 2 weeks, but miraculously on complaining one appears.

First of all, I'd like to say I'm so grateful to Rheumatology (I can't for the life of me remember the doctor who was kind enough to do this for me, was a female under Dr Baxter's clinic) for being good enough to make a referral that my GP should probably have made decades ago. I really am so grateful.  \r\nAnyway, my appointment for Dermatology finally came round, and to say I was anxious is putting it mildly. Not only was I embarrassed to discuss my skin problems, I was worried that it would be a wasted appointment because I really had just about lost all hope of anyone ever being able to help me.  \r\nEnter Dr Stafford, who was working on Dr Burfield's clinic. Not only did she apologise for the long wait for my appointment (which let's face it, given the recent problems with the NHS, was hardly within their control) she was so kind and had the loveliest manner which served to immediately put me at ease. She made what was a very daunting appointment much less so just by her kind and patient nature.  \r\nShe took the time to listen to my 'moans' and I came away with renewed hope that a chronic problem (though possibly not curable and certainly not instantly so) could finally possibly be eased and with a clear and concise plan for potential future management and what the next steps would be in my treatment. I really hope I have her name right, I asked on the way out of the appointment but with a brain like a sieve, it had practically instantly left my mind.  \r\nI know this may seem like a potentially trivial appointment/experience to feedback on, but I can't express how relieved I feel to finally have a bit of hope for something which has affected my life in such a massive way for so long! I feel everyone is always so quick to knock the services when they don't quite meet the standards expected, but never so quick to pass on credit where it's due! I really hope Dr Stafford gets the recognition she deserves for a job well done and that she gets to hear how truly grateful I am! :-)  \r\n","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-08-31T19:17:38.5666667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-09-01T13:02:56.34","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":3},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2022)","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/971315","id":"971315"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/971315/responses","id":"971315"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/971315/healthservices","id":"971315"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/971315/tags","id":"971315"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/c418h_330","id":"C418H_330","score":5},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/c418h_410","id":"C418H_410","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxious","id":"anxious"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dermatology","id":"dermatology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctor","id":"doctor"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/level%20of%20care","id":"level of care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/rheumatology","id":"rheumatology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/skin","id":"skin"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hopeful","id":"hopeful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/relieved","id":"relieved"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20ease","id":"at ease"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/listened%20to","id":"listened to"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/972966","id":"972966"}]},{"id":971386,"author":"listenyx39","authorRoleId":4,"authorRole":"a relative","title":"Huge thank you","body":"I would like to extend my gratitude to Andy, an advanced clinical practitioner at Lewisham Hospital.
