[{"id":867408,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Great GP Practice","body":"I've been with Boultham Park for the last 5 or so years. Getting an appointment isn't too difficult as long as you ring up at 8am and wait in the queue, but it does sometimes take a couple of attempts to get through - some people need to realise that they will have a large amount of calls to deal with which they do in a very efficient manner. If you're not in a rush for an appointment, ringing up during the day is best. I've never had an issue with any of the reception staff, nurses or doctors. All staff are extremely friendly and take the time to get to know you, and will be as helpful as they can if you have a simple query. Compared to other GPs that I've been with in the past, Boultham Park have excelled at everything from my mental health issues, to requesting a repeat prescription and arranging my first smear test. During lockdown when appointments were limited, I would receive phone calls from a GP for a quick catch up to make sure everything was okay and give me a chance to raise any concerns I had which was a really nice touch. You feel taken care of and you can tell that the staff are invested in their patients. Would highly recommend this practice, thank you Boultham Park team!

When I phoned them last Monday on behalf of my mother-in-law I would have been happy for an appointment later in the week, having been told they'd all been booked for that day, but no I was told I would instead have to phone the following day. This meant making sure I got in the telephone queue early enough to get ahead of everyone else. So I phoned at 8am the day after and was still 4 behind other callers. I was also told on my first call that completing the online form would be a quicker way of getting an appointment.\nWell, I completed the online form on Monday morning, but it was because no one got back to me that I had to phone on Tuesday.\nMy own surgery will forward-book appointments, and that works well because most patients don't need a doctor so urgently that they have to be seen on the day they phone.

I had a long stay in ED as there were no inpatient beds available, this was explained to me and staff apologised - it’s not their fault. \nI went to SAU and Brightlingsea Ward, and was operated on later that night. Everyone I came in contact with, from the porters, HCAs, nurses, to the ODPs, anaesthetists and surgeons, they were all kind and friendly, explaining everything they were doing and were incredibly reassuring... appreciated so much when you’re not allowed visitors at the moment. I recovered well on the ward post op, cared for amazingly by the Brightlingsea Ward team, and I’m now resting at home.\nI’m also a nurse working at ESNEFT (not in any departments I was cared for), and appreciate the physical and emotional stress that we are all under at the moment. But no one ever made that obvious, they were all compassionate, with big smiles (beneath their masks!). I cannot thank the staff who looked after me enough, and I am so grateful for their care.

Although one thing I would say is that communication has been quite contrasting especially at times of staff hand over. I feel staff don't always keep themselves up to date and informed with every detail of a patients profile which is difficult as it means that the best quality of care is not always provided to us. For example, when speaking to the consultant on the morning ward round I was told to ensure that I kept hydrated and that I drank as much water as possible. I took this advice on board and began to drink many glasses of water, 15 minutes later a nurse came to take my blood pressure, and was questioning why I was even drinking any water as to their knowledge I should have been fasting. It's conflicting opinions such as these which confuse me as a patient and make me feel as though my care is being compromised to an extent. Overall I feel all the information which has been relayed to me by the doctor regarding my care and treatment is good and it keeps me informed as it is explained very well, I just think that staff need to make more of an effort to keep each other informed in terms of patients current conditions.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-07-29T17:44:58.4333333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-08-02T09:20:03.323","readBy":[{"name":"Southern Health and Social Care Trust","count":7},{"name":"Ulster University, MBBS (Medicine) 2021","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/866817","id":"866817"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/866817/responses","id":"866817"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/866817/healthservices","id":"866817"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/866817/tags","id":"866817"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_32024-4-north-surgical","id":"ZT003_32024-4-north-surgical","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good","id":"good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kind","id":"kind"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/operation","id":"operation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20handover","id":"staff handover"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/conflicting%20advice","id":"conflicting advice"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/clean","id":"clean"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/867651","id":"867651"}]},{"id":866819,"author":"telescopiumsq46","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"A very good experience","body":"After suffering from great pain, I called an ambulance to take me to hospital.

I felt like from the minute I walked through the door I was already a burden.  \r\nThe receptionist didn't seem to care about how much pain I was in, it seemed like to this member of staff I was just another number on a very long list. Staff were visibly distressed and were running around all night. The emergency department is so understaffed and under resourced it's a shambles.  \r\nIt scared me to see other patients not wearing masks and not maintaining the 2 metre social distancing rule. I felt extremely isolated, alone and scared down there for hours, not knowing what was going on. I was in so much pain and nothing was relieving it. It hit a point where I hadn't slept for a day and a half, I was just waiting and waiting and waiting to be seen. I got up and said to the receptionist that I had had enough and that I would consider writing a formal complaint as I knew my health was being compromised, it was only after this threat that staff made a huge effort to get me in straight away. After an assessment down in the waiting area and a couple of tests I was taken up to the ward 4 North.  \r\nNow on this ward a few days I can comment on how outstanding the staff are. All members of staff just can't do enough. I am treated with respect and dignity and the staff completely empathize with how much pain I am in. My consultant has taken plenty of time to explain everything regarding my care so well and all my questions have been answered. I am extremely happy with the treatment I have received and feel like all my needs are being met.  \r\nI am recovering on a clean ward where hygiene is outstanding. The toilet and shower facilities are first class and the food and access to water is also really good. The ward itself is big and spacious and I like how I can have some privacy if I want it via the blue curtain, but I do take many opportunities to interact with the rest of the patients on my bay, its hard to believe how close we have all become in such a short time period.  \r\nFinally staff attitude towards their work in this ward is so inspiring to see. I feel privileged to have such a highly skilled medial and nursing team caring for me and I am looked after so well that against all odds I'm on the road to a full recovery.","criticality":"mildly

Relative moved to Gartnavel General for rehabilitation and we were assured no concerns medically, no CT scan required, just move to Gartnavel General for rehabilitation. One week after arrival at Gartnavel General, new Consultant allocated and has decided more medical tests required for the exact same condition that relative presented with 3 weeks earlier and was admitted for at QEUH yet doctor/s at QEUH had discharged my relative to Gartnavel and said there were no medical issues, only requiring rehabilitation.  \r\nPoor communications from doctors to family about my elderly relative’s condition, very fragmented staffing and frequent changes of doctor and now also a new Consultant therefore very difficult to follow what is actually happening. Three and a half weeks spent in these two hospitals in total so far and we are no further forward in knowing what the issue is with my relative.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-07-29T20:04:44.1466667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-08-02T09:20:04.143","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":8}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/866863","id":"866863"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/866863/responses","id":"866863"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/866863/healthservices","id":"866863"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/866863/tags","id":"866863"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/g505h-elderly-medicine","id":"g505h-elderly-medicine","score":3},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sj9qe-430","id":"sj9qe-430","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confused","id":"confused"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frustrated","id":"frustrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helpless","id":"helpless"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communications","id":"Communications"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/continuity%20of%20care","id":"continuity of care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ct%20scan","id":"CT scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/elderly","id":"elderly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/rehabilitation","id":"rehabilitation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tests","id":"tests"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/family%20kept%20informed","id":"family kept informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/conflicting%20information","id":"conflicting information"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/in%20the%20dark","id":"in the dark"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/868739","id":"868739"}]},{"id":867489,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Great response","body":"Telephone call and follow up actions from this out of hours doctor was  effective, pleasant and precise which the family found to be extremely reassuring - thanks so much","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2021-08-01T09:57:20","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2021-08-02T09:47:31","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/867489","id":"867489"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/867489/responses","id":"867489"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/867489/healthservices","id":"867489"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/867489/tags","id":"867489"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rwxne","id":"RWXNE","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thanks","id":"thanks"}]},{"id":867485,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Kindest of care","body":"My husband was recently admitted to Rotary Ward with a nasty post-operation infection (operation done at another hospital) and I would like to thank everyone who cared for him for the kindness and understanding he received.

I explained again that I have what appears to be a serious infection spreading and worsening and this was ignored and the question asked again, \"would I like to be taken off of the wait list\", at this point I've given up and told them to take me off the list as I could be waiting another 7/8 hours still.\n I'm now in a lot of pain and discomfort and unable to walk, and very concerned this could turn really nasty, with no way of even speaking to a duty doctor or seeing someone. \n My only option now is to call an ambulance or find my way to AandE as I don't drive and can't walk at present because of my medical issue. \n My nearest hospital is a 45 minute to an hour bus ride plus a big walk I'm incapable of at the other end, with no busses running through the night anyway, I am literally stuck on what to do, sat in increasing pain  at 11.30pm and no solution in sight. \n How is it satisfactory or OK to leave someone in pain and clearly unwell with infection with no way of getting treatment?\n Not one person out of the three I spoke to actually took note of my symptoms or what the issue was, they were purely only interested in telling me how busy they were and encouraging me to take myself off of the waiting list, to ease the workload on the duty doctors.\n This service is running to a majorly unacceptable level and if I'm in this situation, I hate to think how many others are too, and even worse, how many people are going to suffer serious consequences and illness due to the lack of help here.\n Looking at the other reviews this is a recurring theme, the NHS is clearly in crisis, and at the cost of people's health and even scarier, lives.

No good morning/afternoon or even a polite hello Forest Gate Surgery, just \"patients name and date of birth\".\n- explained the issue which would fall in the category of requiring an appointment due to the nature of health issue but was told that only a telephone triage would be available even though the condition would not be able to be assessed remotely.\n- telephone triage will not be acceptable for those patients that work in industries where they are not at a base and move around during the day or work in environments where it would be difficult to speak privately.  \n- No empathy to this issue by the receptionist - informed this is the only option and suggested to go to the Royal South Hants Hospital for minor injuries even though it was not an injury but a possible cancer lump! \nI did not make an appointment and was left tearful, frustrated and totally shocked at the appalling service.  I am now fearful of falling ill and requiring help as this service provider is totally failing it's patients.

Within a matter of months, due to changing of partners and reception staff, the quality has gone downhill. It's literally impossible to get an appointment with a doctor and the reception staff lacks customer service. As I had my first first Covid vaccine dose abroad, on 119 advice, I sent my proof of first vaccine to the practice. As it's still not showing on the NHS side, 119 advised that I checked with my GP that the information has been placed correctly in the system. The practice manager said that t it wouldn't show in the system as the first dose was administered abroad which is incorrect. When I asked I would be able to get my Covid Pass if the first dose was not in the system, the practice manager was completely unaware of what the Covid Pass was. As I need to get my dose of vaccine earlier that 8 weeks for work reason, 119 asked me to get it booked through my GP but my GP doesn't book vaccines and does not write letters for us to have the second dose earlier, despite all other doctors do that. My colleagues and friends had this done by their GPs. I requested an urgent appointment to discuss this as well as because I have a mole that worries me as it's become painful but the practice manager said it wasn't urgent as asked me to fill in a long online assessment form. Only one of the original doctors is still working at the practice since the practice has been taken over and all patients are now booking with this particular doctor as they are unhappy with the other doctors. For this reason this particular doctor is overwhelmed with work while the partners do not do very much. It's a terrible situation and I would not recommend you join this GP practice.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2021-08-02T11:40:09","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-08-02T12:31:51","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/867554","id":"867554"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/867554/responses","id":"867554"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/867554/healthservices","id":"867554"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/867554/tags","id":"867554"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/f83005","id":"F83005","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mole","id":"mole"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/overwhelmed","id":"overwhelmed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/terrible","id":"terrible"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unhappy","id":"unhappy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing","id":"amazing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid","id":"covid"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%2019","id":"covid 19"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/869744","id":"869744"}]},{"id":866988,"author":"I dont exist","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Treatment (lack of)","body":"Presented at A& E at NMGH 11. 00 am Monday with large internal bleed.

I know hospital are not a pleasant stay for the reason you're there because you're unwell but this was a experience that couldn't have gone better despite me never being in hospital.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-07-30T12:10:02.7466667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-08-02T14:12:45.083","readBy":[{"name":"Healthwatch Isle of Wight","count":1},{"name":"Isle of Wight NHS Trust","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/867092","id":"867092"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/867092/responses","id":"867092"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/867092/healthservices","id":"867092"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/867092/tags","id":"867092"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/r1f01","id":"R1F01","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/access%20to%20pain%20relief","id":"access to pain relief"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/caring","id":"caring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cleaners","id":"cleaners"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cleanliness","id":"cleanliness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hard%20working","id":"hard working"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helpful","id":"helpful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kindness","id":"kindness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lovely","id":"lovely"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/normal","id":"normal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20scared","id":"not scared"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain%20relief","id":"pain relief"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/prompt","id":"prompt"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/receptionist","id":"receptionist"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/rude%20staff","id":"rude staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/speed","id":"speed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/understanding","id":"understanding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fantastic","id":"fantastic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hca","id":"hca"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/response%20to%20buzzer","id":"response to buzzer"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/869314","id":"869314"}]},{"id":867150,"author":"foxtrotwh45","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Wheelchair repair.","body":"My electric six-wheeled wheelchair required to be repaired as the foot rests had been accidentally damaged.

Over the years, I have had many good experiences as well as bad. Thankfully, my most recent stay has been excellent.  \r\nAfter being referred to a consultant through my GP, a bed was made available for me up on the female medical ward. I was so very happy and glad to have gotten the bed - as well as very grateful for the fact I was examined and seen so very quickly.All the staff have been super -they are just so very kind and explain everything. I would like to specially mention my doctor. She explained everything so very clearly - she made sure to use terminology that I would understand and she really could not have been any nicer to me.Having had many hospital experiences, I can happily say that the food is so much better than it used to be which I am very grateful for.All the nurses which have been involved in my care up on the female medical ward have shown such kindness and I am yet to meet somebody who has been in anyway unpleasant.The only thing that I find a shame is that you don't get to see the doctor at the weekends, so you have to wait until the Monday morning to receive a proper update as to how things are progressing. However, I am entirely understanding that the Doctors also need a break.Overall, my recent stay in Daisy Hill Hospital's Female Medical Ward has been a positive one and all the staff should be commended.","criticality":"minimally critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-07-31T19:14:14.37","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-08-02T15:14:22.587","readBy":[{"name":"Southern Health and Social Care Trust","count":5}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/867376","id":"867376"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/867376/responses","id":"867376"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/867376/healthservices","id":"867376"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/867376/tags","id":"867376"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_33020-medical-f","id":"ZT003_33020-medical-f","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctors","id":"doctors"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/excellent","id":"excellent"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/food","id":"food"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/glad","id":"glad"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/weekend%20working","id":"weekend working"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happy","id":"happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/clear%20explanations","id":"clear explanations"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/869820","id":"869820"}]},{"id":867375,"author":"julynon1990","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"My hospital stay at the Beatson","body":"I have Aspergers and was unfortunate to receive a diagnosis of a Germ Cell Tumour. I attended my GP who immediately referred me to the surgical dept at IRH. This was a scary experience for me as I was socially not able to cope with all these people asking me questions over and over, I was so scared.  \r\nI was referred to the Beatson for review. This is where I met the amazing Dr White. He was not supposed to see me that day but to my amazing luck he filled in for another Dr who was off. His Registrar Lena and specialist nurse Colleen were also there. At first I thought more strange faces. This is when I found out what my diagnosis was and I was devastated but they were amazing. Dr White was clear spoken and honest. I found a huge sense of trust in him and his team. He arrange for my admission and allowed my mum to stay with me. Two days later i arrived at Ward B4, Lesley and her team were so kind to me and understood my challenges with my Aspergers.  \r\nFrom February till July I was an inpatient on and off in Ward B4. I had complications but Dr White and his team addressed these immediately. Throughout my treatment I was reassured by all the staff nursing and medical.  \r\nDr White gave me a chart he made to allow me to see the progress of my tumour markers decreasing. ( im quite a visual person so this was great). He always took the time to ask me what I felt was important to me and he genuinely cared.  \r\nIm now on the next part of my journey and about to be admitted to the GRI for surgery. Dr White and Colleen have ensured this transition will be smooth for me.  \r\nI'm lucky that I can get back to see Dr White and his team for follow up, but I can't thank him enough for all he has done for me to date.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-07-31T18:47:07.1133333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-08-02T15:17:44.117","readBy":[{"name":"Scottish Government","count":1},{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":3}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/867375","id":"867375"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/867375/responses","id":"867375"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/867375/healthservices","id":"867375"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/867375/tags","id":"867375"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/g517h-ward-b4","id":"G517H-ward-b4","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20cared%20for","id":"not cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scared","id":"scared"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20about","id":"Cared about"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/devastated","id":"devastated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diagnosis","id":"diagnosis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/great","id":"great"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/important","id":"important"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lucky","id":"lucky"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20scared","id":"not scared"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tumour","id":"Tumour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/visual","id":"visual"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing","id":"amazing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20for","id":"cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/trust","id":"Trust"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/person%20centred%20care","id":"Person centred care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/felt%20important","id":"felt important"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/867949","id":"867949"}]},{"id":867198,"author":"Clairelayla","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Foot ulcer","body":"My foot had a bad ulcer, my local doctor had been prescribing antibiotics for more than 10wks and the foot wasn’t healing, my daughter took photos every day and was sending them to the surgery, after the 3rd or 4th picture the doctor had realised how bad it actually was, I could not walk or put any type of pressure on the foot and had been suffering for months before  \r\nI was referred to podiatrist at the shankill well-being centre, I have been seen by Ivor, Connor and bronagha, sorry if names are incorrectly spelled, they have done a brilliant job getting my foot back to a healthy state.

She put me at my ease as we chatted about various things unrelated to the appointment and at the end the time scale for my surgical procedure was given to me.  \r\nIt was an uneventful, informative appointment and I left feeling that I had been treated exceptionally well.  \r\nI received a letter the next week giving me a date for my Cholecystectomy which was within 14 days of my pre assessment appointment giving me advice on what I should do etc the day before.  \r\nOn the day of my operation I was directed to the day theatre and although the staff were friendly enough I felt a bit like I was in a cattle market, there were so many people being prepped for theatre.  \r\nAgain I did not have to wait long my personal belongings were stored safely for me and I was escorted into the anaesthetic room where I was informed of what would be happening and they helped me get comfortable on the trolley before administering the anaesthetic.  \r\nI woke up in a ward where I was given a jug of water and was asked to drink as much as I could. I was treated well and the staff were considerate and attentive.  \r\nI was woken two hourly overnight for observations and in the morning the night staff who were finishing their shift placed a glass of water on my table. Night staff weren't so friendly and I got the impression that they couldn't wait to end their shift as they rushed to get finished.  \r\nAll in all though the staff and particularly the lady surgeon who performed my operation were friendly , knowledgeable and kind.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-07-31T10:01:39.3633333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-08-02T15:57:43.523","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Fife","count":6},{"name":"Fife Health & Social Care Partnership","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/867321","id":"867321"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/867321/responses","id":"867321"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/867321/healthservices","id":"867321"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/867321/tags","id":"867321"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/f704h_100","id":"F704H_100","score":5},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/f704h_seal","id":"F704H_SEAL","score":5},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/f704h-preassessment","id":"f704h-preassessment","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anaesthetic","id":"Anaesthetic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/attentive","id":"attentive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cholecystectomy","id":"cholecystectomy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/considerate","id":"considerate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helped","id":"helped"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/informative","id":"informative"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kept%20informed","id":"kept informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kindness","id":"kindness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/knowledgeable","id":"knowledgeable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/night%20staff","id":"night staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/operation","id":"operation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/rushed","id":"rushed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20introduction","id":"staff introduction"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassuring","id":"reassuring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/well%20treated","id":"well treated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20ease","id":"at ease"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/867836","id":"867836"}]},{"id":867323,"author":"venusgk83","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Bowel screening","body":"I recently completed a bowel screening test which showed blood in my stool.

Given the current situation I had expected that I would have to wait for some time for this. I was delighted to be given an appointment within 2 weeks. I arranged to have a covid test appointment 3 days before the procedure.  \r\nOn arrival at Queen Margaret Hospital for my examination, I was greeted by exceptionally helpful staff who took me to the Endoscopy Unit where I was greeted by a lovely receptionist who was very reassuring. I was then seen by one of the nurses who went through in detail what would happen next. The Consultant then saw Ms and explained in further detail the process.  \r\nOn changing and going to the examination room where I was greeted by yet more helpful and reassuring staff. The examination was completed and the results discussed. On arrival in recovery further checks were carried out before I received tea and toast.

Allergic response to dressings developing a rash and blisters on and around the wound. The associated itch and discomfort was intense. Concerned with a possibility of an increased risk for wound infection I phoned the ward for advice. They had a few suggestions most of which I had already tried with no improvement and continued symptoms. Unfortunately ANP was not available when I called.  \r\nOn their advice i emailed my GP with photos and asked them to contact me with advice. The Staff Nurse also said if no improvment I could call next day after 9am to speak to the ANP. Friday morning I was really struggling with the discomfort and becoming increasingly concerned re the impact on healing. With no response from my GP and knowing highly unlikely i would get a same day appointment, i contacted the ward to speak to ANP.  \r\nThey cleary understood my anxieties over infection risk, the distress symptoms and discomfort in wound were causing me. The ANP arranged for me to attend to have a wound review. After examination and cleaning of the wound and the blistering, the reassurance they were able to give was hughly beneficial.  \r\nThe GPs receptionist did call late afternoon with a message from Dr to make an appointment with the Nurse so, as I had anticipated the likelihood is I would have continued to experience dreadful discomfort and worry over the weekend. The receptionist was informed I had already attended the hospital.  \r\nThank you to Staff Nurse and the Trainee ANP for their understanding and support provided. Advice on wound and antihistamines has meant a much more comfortable evening and night. I just wish the GP had contacted me saving a trip to hospital.","criticality":"minimally critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-07-31T11:15:47.9333333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-08-02T16:09:33.247","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Fife","count":16},{"name":"Fife Health & Social Care Partnership","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/867326","id":"867326"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/867326/responses","id":"867326"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/867326/healthservices","id":"867326"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/867326/tags","id":"867326"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/f704h_110","id":"F704H_110","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/fifehscp-gps","id":"fifehscp-gps","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/access%20to%20gp","id":"access to GP"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/allergic","id":"allergic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dressings","id":"dressings"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/infection","id":"infection"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/rash","id":"rash"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassurance","id":"reassurance"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/understanding","id":"understanding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20concerned","id":"very concerned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wound","id":"wound"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/valued","id":"valued"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/contactable","id":"contactable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/listned%20to","id":"listned to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/acknowledged","id":"acknowledged"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wound%20swab","id":"wound swab"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/867989","id":"867989"}]},{"id":867329,"author":"skypx73","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"My visit to Arbroath hospital","body":"After phoning 111 and speaking to helper I was put through to staff who phoned me back and gave me an appointment with the hospital.

The ‘morning staff was so kind and helpful and busy trying to see to everything so well done staff 👍👏🏻. \nI then met the lovely surgeon who explained clearly with respect and genuinely help full with articulacy when describing what is going to be done in the operation so I’m clear. I highly recommend him and the morning staff. \nThe lunch time/afternoon staff were waiting for someone to come with a form for me to sign after I ate and drank fluids, also if I could walk which I could for definite. \nDozens of times I queried if I could go home as directed in my preassesment and suggested in the appointment letter. 6pm came, still no food, very hungry from fasting night before but the nurse politely said they’ve stopped serving hot food now. Earlier I placed my order off the menu too. \nShe was nice and kind because she gave me a selection to choose from with a cake, crisps and a green banana 😑😆. \n8pm came still no joy after asking 3 more times when can I go home? When 9pm or near there came,  a nurse who I asked if she was angry with me explained that the notes came late and there’s no one to do it now so I’ll have to stay in. \nI mentioned that she was hurting me when she pressed to hard so I firmly stopped the blood from the drip needle that had been left in 9 hours.  It was a full drip bag that had been full for at least nine hours and a injection needle in both front of hands that could had been removed hours back by what I gathered. \nI ended up discharging myself because I was supposed to had gone home earlier and my friend who collected me tonight couldn’t drive me home the following day . \nThe staff clearly did not communicate with one another and it was obvious I was forgotten about or ignored maybe! \nIt made my other condition separate to the procedure I had done worse and I was feeling pretty ill from it. I missed my other dose of tablets because I was told wrong that I couldn’t take my other non painkillers too. \nI also asked the young nurse if I could take my two strong painkillers earlier but she said no. \nThe nine o clock nurse said why havnt I taken any tablets, have you got them with you? I replied yes but the nurse shook her head and said no I couldn’t take any 😖. \nMy last operation stay was much better at the other hospital for the aftercare. \nPlease write notes on reception desk for the afternoon/evening staff to read. If done please afternoon evening staff “read” and double check and not leave patients hungry for hours and distressed for cause to complain. 😔\nThank you for taking the time to read this. \n\n","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2021-08-01T00:40:10","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-08-02T18:11:56","readBy":[{"name":"University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/867668","id":"867668"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/867668/responses","id":"867668"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/867668/healthservices","id":"867668"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/867668/tags","id":"867668"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rweak","id":"RWEAK","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/angry","id":"angry"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ignored","id":"ignored"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/aftercare","id":"aftercare"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood","id":"blood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/brilliant","id":"brilliant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/distressed","id":"distressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/drip","id":"drip"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fluids","id":"fluids"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/forgotten","id":"forgotten"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/head","id":"head"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/injection","id":"injection"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/needle","id":"needle"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/operation","id":"operation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/painkillers","id":"painkillers"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pleasantly%20surprised","id":"pleasantly surprised"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surprised","id":"surprised"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/forgotten%20about","id":"forgotten about"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20home","id":"at home"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/868214","id":"868214"}]}]
