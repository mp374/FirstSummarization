On arriving, security was on the door & unstandably would only allow myself in. I had to wait in the corridor to be called to A&E reception. I was called in & as I gave my details to 1 receptionist I noticed another was scrolling through 'The Independent' online. I waited in the waiting room until a nurse called for me. We stood in the waiting room & discussed why I was there. She sent me to x-ray. Off I hobbled down the corridor & waited for my turn. Told the radiographer what was wrong, both my wrist & ankle. My wrist was x-rayed, which caused more pain as she asked me to turn it & move it. I was then sent back to a room opposite A&E. Off I hobbled. 3 receptionist sat there chatting amongst themselves. I approached & told them I had been sent by x-ray, 1 told me to take a seat & someone will call for me. 4th waiting area! A man come & got me. I don't know who he was, or what his profession was, he never told me. I hobbled back down to a room opposite x-ray. 5th area! He examined my wrist, asked 'does it hurt' etc. He then left the room. Another man entered the room, looked surprised to see me. He apologised saying he thought room was empty & proceded to go through the cupboards before leaving. I was left alone again. The first man returned, examined my wrist again. He then began to expain what he thought was wrong. As he spoke he made no eye contact. He stumbled over his words & repeated himself often. He then went to a cupboard, while explaining that I could have a scapuloid break, but this was difficult to diagnose & the treatment for it would be the same, some wrist band/splint thing. He searched the cupboard, I observed him check the 'medium' box at least 4 times, (each time it was empty) he tried a small on me, but realising it didn't fit he placed back in the cupboard & settled on large. He said I needed to go back to reception to book an appointment for a follow up. He explained these were only available on Mondays (2 days time) & I would probably have to wait until the week after, but I could cancel if my pain had gone. Hobbled back to wait in the corridor which is where I started. I was in so much pain, too warm & becoming very frustrated & anxious. Security had left & a nurse was now there. After about 10 mins I asked if someone else could book the appointment. The nurse was lovely, apologised for the wait but told me I would have to wait. I stated my frustration, asking what exactly was taking so long when there was obviously staff sitting about not appearing to be working. She looked over at the receptionists who were talking & advised they must be talking about a patient I said I would hope not! I was eventually called up, handed over the paper I had been given, to be told to take a seat. Really! For the 7th time I had to wait again. 5 different areas! 3 hours with no pain relief! I'll go to Shotley or QE if I ever need","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2021-08-14T21:40:50","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2021-08-15T10:53:11","readBy":[{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2022)","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/870848","id":"870848"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/870848/responses","id":"870848"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/870848/healthservices","id":"870848"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/870848/tags","id":"870848"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rxpcp","id":"RXPCP","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxious","id":"anxious"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frustrated","id":"frustrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20frustrated","id":"very frustrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/alone","id":"alone"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ankle","id":"ankle"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/break","id":"break"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diagnose","id":"diagnose"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/eye","id":"eye"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/get%20fit","id":"get fit"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/looked%20after","id":"looked after"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain%20relief","id":"pain relief"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surprised","id":"surprised"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wrist","id":"wrist"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/x-ray","id":"X-ray"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hope","id":"Hope"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/no%20hope","id":"no hope"}]},{"id":870847,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"A&E","body":"I'm so upset at the attitude of reception and nurses this evening.

However, in this unpleasant situation, it is my great good fortune to be a Woodlands patient.  My named GP and other doctors in the practice have listened to me and treated me with respect, professionalism and honesty.  When I read in Long Covid social media groups about the experiences of others, it is clear that this is not a universal experience. My GP and others in the practice have referred me for tests, enrolled me in appropriate rehabilitation programmes, and prescribed medication for individual symptoms. They have also had the honesty to say that there is a lot about Long Covid that is not yet fully known.  I am sure that this excellent patient care happens partly because the Woodlands GPs, in spite of the immense pressure that the pandemic has put on them, are committed to evidence-based practice and to the importance of listening to patients.\n   I am also impressed with the ways in which the Woodlands administration has found ways of coping with pandemic pressures, both in terms of keeping patients safe and in terms of the huge increase in demand on the practice.  I have used the e-consult option with success and received prompt and professional responses (although there is sometimes a need to, erm, be economical with the truth on some of the questions on the form so that you don't get told to go to ER).  Good use is also made of text messages: for doctors to give appointments, for appointment reminders, and for post-appointment surveys to continue improving processes.\n   I would also like to say that the reception staff, on the telephone and at my rare in-person visits, have been unfailingly efficient, courteous, and understanding.\n   So - well done, Woodlands.  You make things more bearable.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2021-08-14T11:35:02","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-08-16T08:05:32","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/870961","id":"870961"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/870961/responses","id":"870961"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/870961/healthservices","id":"870961"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/870961/tags","id":"870961"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/k84043","id":"K84043","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20listened%20to","id":"not listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/excellent","id":"excellent"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good","id":"good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/great","id":"great"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20good","id":"not good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/rehabilitation","id":"rehabilitation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/safe","id":"safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tests","id":"tests"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/impressed","id":"impressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid","id":"covid"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%2019","id":"covid 19"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/under%20pressure","id":"under pressure"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/873558","id":"873558"}]},{"id":870974,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Awfully long waiting times","body":"I had to attend A&E and was made to wait TEN hours to get seen, then the nurse sorted me out in 5 minutes... wasted my entire day.

The  scanner was in a mobile unit out the back. The technician came to collect me from the meeting point. They asked why I chose a faraway scanner (I'm not local). I needed a more open MRI due to claustrophobia which for me turns to a panic attack. Having a panic attack just means the procedure is stopped and can't be continued. This has happened to me before at Pilgrim and I was treated as an annoyance and time-waster. So I was really reluctant to go back here.\nI told the technician that I get anxious but they made no comment. One of the technicians did offer to place a pad under my neck to add some comfort and this really helped. Fortunately, this time they didn't give me the headphones piping screeching music that was more painful than the MRI sounds. The procedure wasn't great and momentarily I did feel like I was being buried alive. \nThe technicians advised me of every different sound, scan movement and length of time I would hear/feel the scanner moving. I was really grateful for this and told them so. It made such a difference to my anxiety levels. Fortunately, it wasn't too noisy and very strangely I started to nod off! I managed 15 minutes in that scanner and owe it to the compassionate technicians.

I had very bad mental health In 2016. I was recently diagnosed bipolar & other mental health issues. And I was there every day! I felt like I had nobody and I was scared of what I was going to do and I used to ring every day and they would tell me to come in and they were brilliant with me. Specific doctors were so worried about me that they were ringing up just to check was I ok. They chased things up with the cpn, I used to see a counsellor from mind at the doctors surgery, they made sure I was only given a short perscription so not to have too many tablets at once, always made sure I had a follow up appointment after every paper perscription I was given. They would fit me in when they had no appointments, when my medication wasn’t helping they got me reassessed with pysciatrist for a different treatment plan, Absolutely amazing how serious they took me. And I am forever grateful because I feel like if I hadn’t been taken so serious I’d not be here. But it’s hard for me to speak to someone about what I want to speak about at the moment. Because the e consult on the website isn’t on anymore. So you have to ring at 8am for reception to ring you back, fair enough but it’s personal issues about my mental health that I want to see the doctor about and by the time the reception calls me back I’m at work and it’s not the type of thing I can discuss at work. Even a few times ive spoken with reception and got a same day appointment but it’s by telephone and so I havnt got a specific time and I don’t have anywhere private to take the telephone call. A few times this has happened where I’ve been unable to talk about my problem so I’m suffering, There should be an option online to make discrete appointments for people with mental health problems. Sometimes I’ve rang up at 8am and by time reception calls back they have said they have no same day appointments, no routine and call back Such and such day because that’s when more appointments are released. I hope that my comments will be taken on board and that hopefully something might be able to be put in place for people like me. I havnt got a cpn and the waiting lists are long to get back into mind","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2021-08-15T21:16:43","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-08-16T08:56:38","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/870979","id":"870979"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/870979/responses","id":"870979"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/870979/healthservices","id":"870979"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/870979/tags","id":"870979"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/a89010","id":"A89010","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scared","id":"scared"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/worried","id":"worried"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bipolar","id":"bipolar"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/brilliant","id":"brilliant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/get%20fit","id":"get fit"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20scared","id":"not scared"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing","id":"amazing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hope","id":"Hope"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/like%20a%20nobody","id":"like a nobody"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20worried","id":"not worried"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/no%20hope","id":"no hope"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/871215","id":"871215"}]},{"id":870977,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"The worst experience with a hospital ive ever had.","body":"My partner had fallen down the stairs and hurt her tailbone which led to reduced mobility and all round pain while moving.\n\n111 advised she needed an xray at a hospital and sent us here.\nWe got there and were once again advised that an xray was needed.\nOnce more she was told you need to wait for an xray by another, different member of staff.\n\nOur initial time to be seen was 40 minutes, not too bad i thought.\nAfter an hour and a half it was a bit long in the tooth but i thought its worth the wait.\nAfter 3 hours we checked with reception who advised us only an hour and a half more.\n\nAfter SEVEN HOURS OF WAITING on Sunday she finally got in to see a doctor who poked it and said \"yes you've damaged your tailbone\" and only gave a prescription because it was asked for.

I experience frequent chest pain which I'm being investigated for but the concern was the blood.  \r\nWhilst conducting blood tests (BBG) they discovered I had low bi carb and my PH was off meaning I was acidotic. Despite arguing with the ED doctor about being admitted they explained I need to be treated as this was serious and the cause needed to be identified so I agreed. It all went down hill from there.  \r\nI received No communication whatsoever about what was happening with my care once I was admitted. I was only seen by a Dr twice during my 5 day stay and on one of those occasions the Dr was arguing with me about why I was admitted as they had lost my blood results showing the acidiosis and repeatedly told me to calm down and saying I was imagining things, despite the fact I had already received the 12hr iv fluid treatment for the acidiosis. After telling them to send me home then as that was the only reason I was admitted miraculously my results appeared. I didn't even get an apology when they found them.  \r\nI then had to ask to be tested for a kidney infection given I was acidotic and had low bicarb as this shows the issue was with my kidneys. After being told no by the Drs but then speaking to a nurse who agreed I needed to give a sample, it was tested and low and behold I had an infection and was then treated for that.  \r\nOff topic slightly, but on one of the wards I could audibly hear the nurses making fun of me and laughing about a condition I am being investigated for that is in my notes due to their lack of understanding. Making jokes that my conditions acronym stood for psychotic syndrome and that I was a psycho when I hadn't even spoken to these nurses and had been nothing but polite. I think they often forget that even from the nurses station they can be heard.  \r\nOne evening I was refused my antibiotic as it was \"too late to have it\" because the nurse had forgotten to give it to me on time but this was then marked as I had taken it on my chart when I had not. I was then moved wards and the communication got even more dire given I was placed on a surgical ward as a medical patient. This apparently happens frequently and several of the other women in my bay were also medical outliers as they called us. Nurses told me they didn't know what to do with us as they were surgical nurses and a surgical ward and had to \"Google\" the condition I was being investigated for as they had never heard of it before.  \r\nWhen asked if we would be seeing a Dr we were told that the medical Drs don't tend to review when we're on surgical wards and this meant noone was able to request to go home when at this point I'd rather have gone home and gotten worse than stay a minute longer. I was told I was waiting for cardiology only to then be told on the Monday that cardiology weren't coming as I was being seen outpatient and my condition is better assessed in that environment, something I had been saying all along.  \r\nI was then exposed to covid-19 which I understand is unavoidable but the person had been on the ward for nearly two days before getting their results. Once they had been moved and the bay put in isolation it felt like a get everyone home and quick activity. Myself and another patient were still on the bay when a team of 4 decided to come in and start stripping the curtains and the ward and then a team of 8 came in and stared the deep clean with intense and strong chemicals that triggered my asthma to the point I was coughing with chest pains requiring my inhaler and another person was vomiting. The people doing the deep clean were from theatres and expressed how sorry they were but that they had been forced to start even though we were still in there, saying there were patients in A&E who were more important, and that we were going home anyways.  \r\nDue to my asthma being triggered an extremely kind nurse got me out of the room and allowed me to wait outside for my paperwork and medication. Three hours prior to this I had been told my paperwork was already completed though only to be told it hadn't been started. Then when I got my discharge paperwork it was not even correct with why I was admitted in the first place, nor that I was acidotic and treated for this, or that I had a kidney infection. It also didn't mention that the consultant had told me I had viral bronchitis.  \r\nI got in the car to go home and sobbed my heart out. There was a ward sister who spent time with me during my stay and explained things to me that is a credit to the hospital and also the nurse that got me out of that room during the covid clean. I would not recommend any of my family or friends attend this hospital and I apologise but I am grateful to be moving home so that I do not have to fear being admitted to LCH again and the emotional

The surgery is able to do them midweek and it was arranged by Tissue Viability that District nurses would change them at the weekend. I feel that the service provided is very hit and miss with nurses turning up on the correct day sometimes and not others.  \r\nThe tissue viability nurse arranged for these visits because he needed the dressings changed more often than once a week and therefore Saturday was arranged to be the day it was to be done. I obviously have to be there and so wait in for the the DN, having got the room ready for his legs to be washed and redressed with the dressings I lay out ready. I usually phone to find out if they are coming, and have had various reasons given for them not coming, including a day change to Sunday without our agreement, not being booked in at all and on a couple of occasions phone calls to say they won't come and asking me to rebook.  \r\nWhilst I realise that this is an overworked service and maybe sometimes urgent cases take precedence, I think that my husband and other people like him should be able to rely on this service as it is necessary for his legs to be dressed and for him to be as comfortable as possible. Another point I would like to make is that it seems that not everyone looks at his notes either on your computer which are the most up to date, or in the folder before doing his legs. Some nurses don't always want to follow the care plan exactly as far as the type and number of dressings they have to apply.  \r\n","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-08-12T17:10:58.3866667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-08-16T09:20:01.577","readBy":[{"name":"Bromley Healthcare","count":5},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2021)","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/870371","id":"870371"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/870371/responses","id":"870371"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/870371/healthservices","id":"870371"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/870371/tags","id":"870371"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/nqv-district-nursing","id":"nqv-district-nursing","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/nqv-tissue-viability","id":"nqv-tissue-viability","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care%20plan","id":"care plan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dementia","id":"dementia"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/expertise","id":"expertise"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/forgotten","id":"forgotten"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/leg","id":"leg"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/read%20notes","id":"Read notes"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/the%20change","id":"the change"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tissue%20viability","id":"tissue viability"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/consistency%20of%20care","id":"consistency of care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/following%20care%20plan","id":"following care plan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/leg%20dressing","id":"leg dressing"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/871109","id":"871109"}]},{"id":870380,"author":"Rosemary97","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"My stay at lincoln hospital","body":"I was admitted yesterday my gp and they decided I need to stay in I had to wait 3hrs for a bed then a person was placed in the bay and kept us all up - in fact patients were discharging themselves cause they couldn't handle this very rude annoying person.

During her time in hospital she received wonderful care from her doctors and nurses. During her stay they stabilised mum, sorted her meds and she was happily discharged home today to her own home where she lives a very independent life. Whilst this was a very positive experience and we are very grateful for her care I would like to relate some feedback which was not so positive.  \r\nI received a phone call from Ward 20 to say that mum was being discharged and as her bed was needed she had been sent down to the waiting area in Ward 6 and I could go and collect her. When I arrived at the Ward they advised me that whilst mum was indeed in the waiting area she could not go home as her medication had not been dispensed and wouldn't be ready for approximately two hours. The problem with this is that nobody advised me of this when they rang to say mum was discharged. I had left work early to go the hospital to get her and would therefore have to sit with her for two hours, which I am sure under current Covid restrictions is less than ideal, given that hospitals are trying to limit foot fall. I decided to take mum home and arranged for a relative who works in the hospital to collect her medication when it was ready later that afternoon. I feel that the Ward should have given me all the information relating to mum's discharge to avoid me making a journey to collect her when she was not actually ready to leave. I was just fortunate that I had someone to call upon who worked in the hospital who could collect her meds later that afternoon. Another issue that arose when I arrived at Ward 6 to collect mum I was that I was asked to sign a track and trace log, which is fine, however, this log was a sheet of paper sitting openly on a desk at the waiting area. I was astounded to see that I was being asked to provide my name, my address, my date of birth and my telephone number. This seemed to me to be unnecessary information that was being gathered for track and trace purposes. Surely a name and telephone number would have sufficed, what on earth use was my date of birth. What was more problematic was that this log was on full view for anyone to look at and when completing my information I could see everyone else's personal information as would anyone else completing the log. I do not think that personal data should be handled and managed in this way and on full view for others to see. The log should be kept privately and the ward staff should be asking for the information and completing it so as to prevent every Tom, Dick and Harry seeing other people's information. Also I think the amount of data that was being gathered, such as a date of birth and address simply was not required for track and trace. I understand that for staff to gather the data could be problematic in terms of finding the time in their busy days, so perhaps to mitigate the sharing of people's very personal information they could consider limited the information to a name and phone number.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-08-12T23:08:20.9466667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-08-16T09:20:02.09","readBy":[{"name":"South Eastern Health and Social Care Trust","count":5},{"name":"Public Health Agency","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/870421","id":"870421"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/870421/responses","id":"870421"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/870421/healthservices","id":"870421"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/870421/tags","id":"870421"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt004_07021_430","id":"ZT004_07021_430","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt004_07021-16","id":"zt004_07021-16","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cardiac","id":"cardiac"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/discharge%20process","id":"Discharge process"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/elderly","id":"elderly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/privacy","id":"privacy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting","id":"waiting"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%2019","id":"covid 19"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bit%20frustrated","id":"bit frustrated"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/872681","id":"872681"}]},{"id":870502,"author":"Mpositive","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Unnecessary overnight stays","body":"I have a planned biopsy at the Beatson but I have to go the day before in the early afternoon for a procedure the next day.

Now, Finton done my feet, he was excellent, an inspiration, he really cares for us. I've had a great experience from all people in John Mitchell, each and every one of them do a great job and have a smile for everyone.  \r\nI was in this Monday past, he done my feet, we had a chat, and as he stood up to give me some privacy, as they all do, I saw the rosary in his tunic. He explained he had gone through a traumatic time, and he wore the rosary through the whole time and he still wears it now, so I can say, Finton, who has gone through so much and come out the other side so lovely, so jolly, so willing to help people: you are brilliant.  \r\nThe first person to see me at podiatry was Marla, but I think she has retired now. But each and every person at John Mitchell is amazing, from the receptionist to the people that come round, they are all so welcoming, lovely, lovely people. I couldn't thank them enough, they are so accommodating.  \r\nI took a bit of a toe infection and treated it myself - I'm a diabetic type II, so I'm entitled to get the appointments - but I thought, no, there are other people that need the care and attention more than me - so I cut the sandals off, put the creams on and everything, and it started to heal up nicely - but would you believe it, the infection came back.  \r\nSo I rang up last week, explained the situation, and they were instantly understanding and said to come in at a quarter past eleven, told me to phone my doctor as soon as possible to sort out some antibiotics. So I did this and came in on Monday and saw everyone, and everyone has been so great during these difficult times, and even before these times, they are so great, so welcoming, so lovely all the time. We are just so lucky to have them.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-08-13T15:03:46.2533333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-08-16T09:54:54.953","readBy":[{"name":"Southern Health and Social Care Trust","count":11},{"name":"Public Health Agency","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/870633","id":"870633"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/870633/responses","id":"870633"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/870633/healthservices","id":"870633"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/870633/tags","id":"870633"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003-podiarty","id":"zt003-podiarty","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/accommodating","id":"accommodating"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/antibiotics","id":"antibiotics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/brilliant","id":"brilliant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/caring","id":"caring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diabetic","id":"diabetic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/excellent","id":"excellent"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/feet","id":"feet"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/great","id":"great"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/infection","id":"infection"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/inspirational","id":"inspirational"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lovely","id":"lovely"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lucky","id":"lucky"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attitude","id":"staff attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/teamwork","id":"teamwork"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/toe","id":"toe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/welcoming","id":"welcoming"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing","id":"amazing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassuring","id":"reassuring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/873049","id":"873049"}]},{"id":870649,"author":"MartyC","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"First Colonoscopy","body":"Went to Forth Valley hospital today for a colonoscopy as a result of small traces of blood found in my biennial bowel cancer test.  \r\nHeard all the usual horror stories about Moviprep and colonoscopy procedures, but the Moviprep is nothing more than a means to flush out the bowel and I could do it again without any concerns.  \r\nThe experience and care in the hospital was way beyond my initial expectation (mild fear!)

Subsequently for 12 weeks I took part in a physical activity session online along with several other cancer patients.  \r\nThe exercises were explained and demonstrated by Joe. They were easy to follow . You could complete them at your own pace with encouragement and advice from Joe as you did them.  \r\nI found the sessions very beneficial and enjoyable. I certainly improved as I continued week on week.  \r\nWith the COVID situation it is difficult for cancer patients in the middle of treatment to get out and about. I found these online sessions so useful. During times when I was unable to get out much they provided much needed exercise and movement.  \r\nJoe is very approachable and encouraging. The exercises are gentle and manageable.

Over two weeks later someone came out to the house to review the wheelchair and another wheelchair was ordered to suit my husband. It was delivered a week later and as my husband was in bed and no one to hoist him into the chair I was given instructions by using an allen key how to adjust the head piece. Later that day when the carers arrived he was hoisted into the chair but nether me nor the carers could adjust this and my husband was in some pain while we tried. For three days now I have tried to reach the OT by phone to no avail, this morning I was contacted by the office and told it would be at least 2 weeks and maybe more before someone could come out to address this problem. I find it hard to believe that there is only one person in the whole company that can do this. Once more after all this time my husband is bedbound, very emotional and fed up and who could blame him for this.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-08-13T15:56:52.08","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-08-16T12:28:47.323","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":6},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/870671","id":"870671"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/870671/responses","id":"870671"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/870671/healthservices","id":"870671"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/870671/tags","id":"870671"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sj9-westmarc","id":"SJ9-westmarc","score":2},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/delivery","id":"delivery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fed%20up","id":"fed up"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/head","id":"head"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/instructions","id":"Instructions"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stroke","id":"stroke"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting","id":"waiting"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wheelchair","id":"wheelchair"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/873026","id":"873026"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/873050","id":"873050"}]},{"id":870682,"author":"avocetwh64","authorRoleId":4,"authorRole":"a relative","title":"Post-stroke assessment and treatment","body":"My husband had a stroke Christmas 2020, at a much younger age than would be expected. Received treatment quickly and treated very well at the stroke unit at Crosshouse Hospital by fantastic and knowledgeable medical and nursing staff.  \r\nSince then, with exception of a very helpful OT he finally saw in June 2021, he has spoken with a stroke nurse twice by telephone - from February 2021, and spoken with his GP two-three times via phone. Both of whom, since he started experiencing significant pain in his foot, which keeps him awake at night on top of existing post-stroke fatigue, have not offered any assessment or advice and have strangely focused instead on denying it is related to his stroke - despite not even seeing him to evaluate. It is like he imagined having a stroke. The GP twice now over the last two-three months when he has finally given in to the pain and called to make an appt to discuss it, has refused to see him and has on both occasions said the pain will either be due to a historical problem with his back, or his mental health and suggested, on both occasions, he use some hypnotherapy CDs. The irony here is that I think it's the lack of someone taking him seriously will begin to affect his mental wellbeing. Talk about diagnostic overshadowing. He is certainly feel hopeless about being taken seriously. And if it is disc related pain it is not clear how hypnotherapy will help assess and treat this either.  \r\nMy husband has been trying various exercises and foot supports already via his own investigation. The stroke nurse also via phone - has never seen him face to face or even via the much heralded NHS Near Me, though who did helpfully refer to OT earlier- also decided it will be plantar fasciitis and not related to his stroke. It is like they are all denying he had a stroke- which has been seen on MRI, treated with thrombolysis, and has impacted his health in other ways. And are making various diagnoses over the phone.  \r\nThe OT - who has no problem visiting patients face to face at home or elsewhere -consulted a physio colleague who thought it would be most likely post-stroke pain, given the specific nature of his symptoms but advised the waiting list for physio is 8 months, and much longer for neuro physio assessment- so he saw a physio. They examined my husband and said it was likely post stroke pain due to no inflammation of the plantar area in his foot and his symptoms. Still the GP, by phone (again) says refuses this diagnosis and says it will not be due to his stroke and offers a phone (yet again) consult this time with the surgery physio, whom we have never been told was available at the surgery, or assessment offered - who today 'assessed' him via phone, and yet again, said it may just be a co-incidence the pain followed his stroke and it would be unlikely to be caused by the stroke. They have however offered him a face to face appt in a week. It feels like banging your head on a brick wall, no one is listening. No tips, even for exercise or stretching etc have ever been offered, for whatever the pain may be. Instead, they are more interested in bending over backwards to prove my husband does not have pain in his foot, and if he does, to say it isn't caused by his stroke, than actually offering to see him for a quick appt face to face and and helping him. It's not a big ask. Having a stroke and living with the aftermath is hard enough.  \r\nMy husband continues to work well in his career, albeit at slightly reduced pace, and is keen to keep working. He is trying to stay positive. He has never had a mental health problem, though was naturally in a bit of a shock in the immediate weeks after his stroke. To be faced with denial from his GP practice and stroke professional who won't even see him face to face and being told his foot pain and altered sensation is a historical back problem or a mental health problem (without even investigating these if this were so!) and repeatedly pushed to accept hypnotherapy CDs is downheartening, bizarre and extremely frustrating, and at worst I feel it is prolonging any damage done by his stroke. Why they cannot just agree he has had a stroke and offer assessment and then physio or nerve medication at very low dose to alleviate his pain as appropriate in relation to whatever is causing his pain is odd. To blame it on his mental health is extraordinary - and I say this as an experienced mental health professional. And to do all this via telephone over a period of months risks something being missed, and again further prolonging any damage done by the stroke.  \r\nIn my opinion, none of this demonstrates good quality care or best practice in terms of even the basics of person-centred care or post-stroke assessment or treatment. And I also thought we were beyond those days of blaming physical health issues on mental health.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-08-13T16:46:08.8133333","progress":"Story

I can not physically put pressure on my legs as this causes excruciating pain in my pelvic. I was admitted to UCLH because I was in a lot of pain that day for a separate emergency.  \r\nI stayed overnight whilst waiting for a bed to be available in a ward. They did not let me take my wheelchair as I came with the ambulance and my mother who is my full time carer was not allowed to come with me to help me. The problem that I had was that every time I needed to use the toilet I had to ask the nurses for a wheelchair. In the first instance after being admitted to the emergency department, I asked for a wheelchair to allow me to use the toilet. The staff told me they didn’t have any wheelchairs available and left.  \r\nI then asked for a commode and they told me they did not have one at that moment. I asked if they could give me anything to hold onto and again they said no. I was so desperate that I had to get up and hold the walls and anything around me whilst crying out in pain just to use the toilet. I thought I was going to collapse. That was the most painful thing I have ever had to do.  \r\nI was then moved to a different part of the hospital for checks. I thought maybe things would be better from there. I was very wrong. Whilst in desperate need for the toilet I waited around 10-15 minutes each time for a nurse to get back to me. If I was able to walk I could easily walk to the toilet myself when I needed too. As a wheelchair user I needed someone to push me and take me to the toilet and help me. I can not count the amount of times I had to ‘hold it in’ and bare the excruciating pain which is associated with my condition.  \r\nWhen they did finally find a wheelchair for me after waiting another 30 minutes the nurse took me to the toilet and when I was finished and waited for them to push me back to my bed I had to sit in the wheelchair in the toilet for another 10 minutes calling out to someone for help.  \r\nThroughout this whole experience the only relief that I had was when they allowed my mum to visit me after begging the nurses and she brought my wheelchair and assisted me as she usually does. I also used a commode twice which was fine until I couldn’t properly clean myself without help. I tried not to drink anything as I knew that I would need the toilet and would have to wait a long time for a nurse to push me.  \r\nI have never in my life been more disappointed and disgusted with the health care system. I feel embarrassed and ashamed as a disabled person. My basic human needs were not met and I can not imagine how many more people have and will experience the same thing. It is very clear that being disabled or less abled is a burden that could not be catered to on this occasion in an NHS hospital.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-08-14T01:34:21.21","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2021-08-16T13:40:41.787","readBy":[{"name":"Plymouth University, BSc (Hons) Urgent and Emergency Care 2022","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/870728","id":"870728"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/870728/responses","id":"870728"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/870728/healthservices","id":"870728"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/870728/tags","id":"870728"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rrv03_180","id":"RRV03_180","score":1},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disappointed","id":"disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disgusted","id":"disgusted"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/embarrassed","id":"embarrassed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helpless","id":"helpless"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/burden","id":"burden"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/carer","id":"carer"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/collapse","id":"collapse"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/commode","id":"commode"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/desperate","id":"desperate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disability%20awareness","id":"disability awareness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disabled","id":"disabled"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency","id":"emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/legs","id":"legs"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pelvic","id":"pelvic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pelvic%20pain","id":"pelvic pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20numbers","id":"Staff numbers"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/training","id":"training"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/walk","id":"walk"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wheelchair","id":"wheelchair"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/access%20to%20toilets","id":"access to toilets"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20disappointed","id":"very disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disability%20accommodation","id":"disability accommodation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/attentiveness","id":"attentiveness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/crying","id":"crying"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/under%20pressure","id":"under pressure"}]},{"id":870729,"author":"Min78","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Worry and anxiety","body":"I contacted the service after a lot of different life factors started to become too overwhelming and was causing me immense amounts of worry and anxiety whereby I was not sleeping well or wanting to do anything.  \r\nFrom the initial phone call to the sessions, every person I spoke to was caring, kind and empathetic and genuinely wanted to help me.

I decided to do this as I was at university and having a diagnosis could give me extra support at uni. I had my first appointment at the start of 2019 and was told then that I most likely do have ADHD and someone would be in touch to make a second appointment with my mum.  \r\n2 years later, in February 2021 after calling multiple times to ask when my appointment would be, I was told I was lost in the system. They apologised and set up an appointment with the covering psychiatrist for 2 weeks later. When I had this appointment I was told that they couldn't do anything as they had none of my original notes and I would have to wait for the person who had seen me previously to be available. I then put a complaint in as I felt I was not getting the care I deserved.  \r\nOn the back of this, I was given another appointment with the covering psychiatrist where I was given the diagnosis then had a follow up to start meds. The person I originally saw was coming back a week later so was told that my follow up from starting the meds would happen with them.  \r\nWe are now 20 weeks down the line and still have not had a phonecall or appointment to even ask how I am getting on with these controlled meds. I have called no less than 5 times within this time. The first few times, (about 5/6 weeks after starting meds) I was told there was a lot to catch up on, and that I'd get an appointment in due course. I called again last week and was told that a staff member is leaving and they have no replacement yet so cannot make me an appointment or tell me when I will get one.  \r\nI feel this is totally unacceptable. Especially since I started a controlled drug with no support or follow up in the slightest and no one seems to be able to help me.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-08-14T09:23:03.21","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-08-16T14:04:26.323","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Forth Valley","count":6}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/870756","id":"870756"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/870756/responses","id":"870756"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/870756/healthservices","id":"870756"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/870756/tags","id":"870756"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/clackmannanshire-chc-cmht","id":"clackmannanshire-chc-cmht","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/adhd","id":"adhd"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diagnosis","id":"diagnosis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/follow-up","id":"follow-up"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unsupported","id":"unsupported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting%20times","id":"waiting times"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication%20advice","id":"medication advice"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/uncertainty","id":"uncertainty"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/forgotten%20about","id":"forgotten about"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/871948","id":"871948"}]},{"id":871059,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Poor accessibility ","body":"The telephone line is permanently busy.
