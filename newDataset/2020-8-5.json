Alison arranged two monthly visits and gradually was clearing my daughter's ears, taking account of the sensitivity felt by her.  \r\nAt the last visit in January, before lockdown one ear had been cleared and was again showing a little wax; the other ear showed 10% of the ear drum.  \r\nAlison made our visits so calm, and was sensitive to my daughter's needs.  \r\nSince January there have been no visits. One GP at my daughter's medical practice refuses to attend the residential home to check for wax as he says this is not an emergency. Another GP at the same practice, the one who arranged the ENT sessions, is willing for my daughter to be taken to the medical practice, making a special arrangement appointment, to check the ears but the residential home feel it is preferred that my daughter does not attend the surgery due to lockdown.  \r\nMy daughter does not show signs of distress so no infection is indicated but as she has no speech she cannot tell people, or sign, to say how much she can hear. She puts up with a lot of things without complaint. She showed no distress when both her ears were blocked with hard dark wax. She just didn't hear properly. Hearing is so important, and vitally so when she cannot verbalise.  \r\nWhat is the answer here as lockdown looks to continue for some time?  \r\nNormally I take her to any medical or dental appointment but I am not in a position presently to override the precautions in place to safeguard residents.

I was suffering from severe abdominal pain and regular vomiting caused by chronic pancreatitis . This was diagnosed in 2014 and I have had many similar flare ups over the past six years .  \r\nSoon after I was admitted I was seen by a doctor in casualty who took details and offered me IV morphine to ease the pain. They also told me that the GI dept had been informed I was here and somebody from there would see me soon . I pointed out that I was taking 40mg MST every day and that giving me 10mg IV morphine might not help much , they replied that it was all that they could give me but I would get something stronger from GI staff once they had assessed me. The IV morphine didn't have any effect on the pain and I was given several further doses until I felt it was pointless taking any more because it was having no effect and that taking more morphine might restrict my chances of being given something stronger by a member of the GI staff. Every time a nurse administered the morphine they waited to see if it was working and when it hadn't, they all told me not to worry because someone from GI would see me soon and give me something to properly help me . I frequently told them that my pain was at an 8 to 9 out of 10.  \r\nAround 2100 I was moved to the Acute Medical Unit , Base 2 and the last thing the nurse from A&E told me was that she hoped GI would see me soon and give me some pain relief at least. My pain was still between and 8 and 9 until it gradually subsided to an 8 out of ten about 0800 on the Saturday. By this point I had been in hospital for fifteen hours in agony but by then I was getting more and more distressed because nobody from GI had turned up to give me something to help me .  \r\nIt wasn't until 1015 that a GI specialist saw me in the ACU. I made sure I was up , dressed and had had something to eat before then because I was determined that I was leaving hospital soon by this point . I told him my pain was an 8 out of 10 but I hadn't been sick again . They told me that I could be discharged that day but said they would get someone to speak to me about my newly diagnosed diabetes of which I was unaware until my blood sugars were closely monitored the night before.  \r\nBy midday I was so fed up with the wait and asked the nurse on duty to remove the canula from my arm and return my supply of morphine MST tablets . I also explained that the reason I was desperate to leave was because I was upset about how long it had taken GI to see me . She asked me if I would wait for a discharge letter , which she stated wouldn't take long and I agreed because I didn't want it to look like I had not met my obligations as a patient by discharging myself , particularly when I was still in a great deal of pain .  \r\nI was finally given my letter a little before 1800 on Saturday, 6 hours later . When I read the discharge letter it incorrectly states that I was given IV morphine which worked .  \r\nI am writing to complain primarily about the time I was left in great pain in hospital without being assessed by somebody who was in a position to help me. I have always regarded a 10 out of ten on the pain scale to be pain so bad I pass out so to be at 9 or 8 for me is almost completely unbearable.  \r\nIn 2014 I first experienced similar pain and was admitted to ERI again by ambulance and had an almost identical 17 hours plus wait to be seen by a GI specialist. On that occasion I discharged myself because I was so frustrated at being left in hospital in pain and nobody who could help me did . I am not making the 2014 event a complaint but am including it as it provides vital context as to my reasons for not being admitted to hospital when my pain becomes unbearable and my daily MST tablets aren't enough to help.  \r\nI also want to point out the emotional distress my recent experiences in hospital have caused me. During the 15 hours I spent in great physical pain almost two weeks ago , I began to get more and more frustrated and then upset that nobody who could help me was coming . This led me to thinking that I would be better off at home and that it was very unlikely I would ever come back to hospital, no matter how much pain I was in.  \r\nThe delay in me being discharged from AMU was also really frustrating , particularly since the staff knew that I was desperate to get home. I do acknowledge that an event happened around 1300 in Base 2 but that was dealt with within an hour. When I read the letter, I was very disturbed to read the false picture of my stay they portrayed and also how long it actually took him to write it. If they had checked with A&E surely they would have known the IV morphine wasn't working .The emotional distress took me several days to recover from . Today is the first day I have felt up to the task of reliving my experience in order to write to you","criticality":"moderately

As I was anxious, I checked if the tests had been sent as the IVF clinic were not proceeding with me despite my cycle. \nOver a month had passed and the admin staff kept telling me that the secretary will action sending the test results to the IVF Clinic, I even gave them the email which I was shocked they needed from me given they must have at some point communicated with them? When asked about a timeline they said they could'nt tell when the sect will action it. I kept telling them that I will miss my cycle and the test results are already out as on my repeated requests they have been sent to me, however they need an Agresso login which I don't have as I don't work for the NHS, neither could the Fertility clinic access them (whom I fwded the email). \nEnd result, no one took responsibility of sending the results, I missed the cycle and there is still no clarity on when the results will be sent (or ever they will). When I was upset over the phone I was told to keep my emotions over check when speaking to staff (as I said 'what the hell' is going on). When I asked about Diversity and Inclusiveness within the practice (non-clinical staff) I was told it was too confidential to disclose. When I asked to speak to a Practice Manager, I was told she will call me when she can but it cannot be today as it is not a priority (which I can understand given Covid but it would still be useful to know if it will happen this week or next month). Basically after a month of follow up, nothing has come out of it and I am told to keep my emotions under check as complaining to admin staff is not tolerated in the practice. So I have really no where to go and no one to go to and my entire life depends upon an admin staff's mood to send that one email. \nPS: Nurses and Drs in this practice are lovely and deserve the praise.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-08-05T09:20:28","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2020-08-05T11:07:50","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/779409","id":"779409"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/779409/responses","id":"779409"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/779409/healthservices","id":"779409"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/779409/tags","id":"779409"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/k84082","id":"K84082","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxious","id":"anxious"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/shocked","id":"shocked"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20upset","id":"very upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood","id":"blood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fertility","id":"Fertility"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ivf","id":"IVF"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scan","id":"scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/terrible","id":"terrible"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/test","id":"test"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tests","id":"tests"}]},{"id":779408,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Unprofessional ","body":"I have never ever known such a unresponsive doctors in my life 3 days trying to ring for my elderly mum to respond to a request they made up to 17 times a day I have tried and been on hold for up to 20 minutes are there no professionals in this practice to answer the phone I can’t email what a debacle disgusting!!!!","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-08-05T09:55:22","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-08-05T11:08:56","readBy":[{"name":"Healthwatch Oldham","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/779408","id":"779408"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/779408/responses","id":"779408"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/779408/healthservices","id":"779408"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/779408/tags","id":"779408"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/p85008","id":"P85008","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/elderly","id":"elderly"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/793711","id":"793711"}]},{"id":779410,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"very professional ","body":"everything done in a very professional manner. baring in mind the  corona virus restrictions the hygiene arrangements were excellent. i would like to thank you for a smooth and painless operation, and very much improved vision                       ","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-08-05T10:13:55","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-08-05T11:10:01","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/779410","id":"779410"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/779410/responses","id":"779410"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/779410/healthservices","id":"779410"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/779410/tags","id":"779410"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/npg01","id":"NPG01","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/operation","id":"operation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vision","id":"vision"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/780646","id":"780646"}]},{"id":779066,"author":"Ms Bookworm","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Recent CAU visit and follow-up care","body":"In early June, I began experiencing a dull, persistent ache/pain on my right side. It culminated one evening in being in intense stabbing pain and discomfort. I'd had my appendix removed in my teens, so knew it wasn't that. I was seen by my GP the next morning, who referred me to Ayr CAU. Long story short, after several hours in the team's excellent care, which included a CT scan, they concluded that it may have been a kidney stone, although nothing of that nature remained tin evidence on the scan. However, via this scan, they also spotted that my left ovary was enlarged and the doctor advised he would be referring me for a gynae appointment as well as a renal follow-up. I was incredibly grateful for their thoroughness and all-round care.  \r\nThis appointment came through really quickly and I was seen first by the excellent Michelle and her team. In fact, to say Michelle's manner and care was \"excellent\" really is an understatement. She gave generously of her time and experience to explain things to me and most of all, was so reassuring. Not in a glib \"there, there, I'm sure it will be fine\" way but really genuinely reassuring, explaining things properly, unhurriedly and not patronising or anything. All the team were caring too, making you feel at ease in a really uneasy environment.  \r\nAfter this, I had an equally quick follow-up ultrasound to get a more detailed look than the CT scan could provide. The two ladies who saw me that day too were so kind and professional, keeping me relaxed and informed as they did the procedure.  \r\nAnd this was followed up, once again, so quickly by an appoinment I had today with gynae consultant Dr Konamme. He was lovely - professional, considerate, explaining things well, and so thorough. I had another camera scope but while all this was happening, there was lots of light-hearted conversation amongst the supporting nursing staff, that kept the smile quota high and the anxiety level low, being a great deflection from what is understandably an uncomfortable procedure. Instead of feeling tensed up, I was as at ease as possible. And Dr Konamme took the time to show me the good news, pointing things out on the screen and reassuring me that, in his opinion, everything looked fine. My appointment concluded with the invitation to contact his secretary directly should another similar occurrence happen within the next 6 months.  \r\nAnd just this evening, Michelle called just to check in and make sure I was ok and to see if I had any remaining questions etc. following today's appointment. And also to let me know not hesitate to get in touch should anything crop up in the near future that concerns me in this area.  \r\nHow do you even find language for this level and quality of care? From the GP appointment, and CAU visit, to the three visits to the gynae team, it has simply been a journey of true care, the utmost professionalism and just lovely, considerate human beings. And all this in the midst of a global pandemic! I'm truly beyond grateful to each and every one of them.  \r\nAnd to the Whitehall government if you read these forums (and you really should!) - pay heed! Our NHS are not just world-class, but world-leading. Even under severe austerity cuts and challenges, we are the envy of the world.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-08-03T16:38:06.2","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-08-05T11:15:04.53","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Ayrshire & Arran","count":12},{"name":"Scottish Government","count":2},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/779066","id":"779066"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/779066/responses","id":"779066"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/779066/healthservices","id":"779066"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/779066/tags","id":"779066"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/a103h_502","id":"A103H_502","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/above%20and%20beyond","id":"above and beyond"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/camera","id":"camera"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/caring","id":"caring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/considerate","id":"considerate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ct%20scan","id":"CT scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/explaining","id":"explaining"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gynae","id":"gynae"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kidney%20stone","id":"kidney stone"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/manner","id":"manner"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ovary","id":"ovary"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/patient%20and%20thorough","id":"patient and thorough"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professional","id":"professional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/quality%20of%20care","id":"Quality of care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/renal","id":"renal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thorough","id":"thorough"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ultrasound","id":"ultrasound"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassuring","id":"reassuring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/relaxed","id":"relaxed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fast%20appointments","id":"Fast appointments"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20ease","id":"at ease"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/780616","id":"780616"}]},{"id":779414,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Rude Receptionist","body":"Wow, the doctors, nurses, secretaries here are all wonderful, polite and happy to assist, the receptionist though is a completely different story!

When I then spoke to the nurses I was told that she could not have any anti-sickness as \"she had already had that in theatre\".  \r\nWhen I also asked the nurses about pain relief, as she said she was sore, I was told \"sorry we can't give her anything for pain when she is being sick\". I suggested perhaps an injection? and they said they would ask the doctor.  \r\nAny time I phoned the ward, it was very difficult to get some-one to answer, and staff frequently wouldn't tell me how she was getting on, suggesting that I phoned her mobile phone and making it clear that the call was an inconvenience.  \r\nShe was discharged a few days later, however without any instructions about do's and don'ts etc, she was told that all the information leaflets had been packed away as the ward was moving back to where it normally was. Investigations before her operation indicated that she would need to be started on some new medication. She was given this without any instructions on how often or when to take this - it was not labelled either.  \r\nUnfortunately only a few hours after discharge, I had to take her back to A&E with vomiting and fever. She could not self-refer to the ward as instructed, as they would not answer the phone, it rang and rang until it cut off. That night, despite assurances someone would call me, no one did, so after a couple of hours I called the ward, only to be told \"there's nothing to tell you at the moment, why don't you just call in the morning\". This was far from reassuring as I was really concerned about her.  \r\nFollowing investigations, she was discharged 3 days later, still not able to eat or drink very much at all, and when we unpacked her tablets, the anti-sickness tablets had been missed out. Apparently the nurse had told her that if she wanted them she would have to wait for quite some time and this would delay her getting home. She was so keen to leave the ward, she just accepted this, which of course meant her GP had to arrange some later that day.  \r\nI would say that she is still recovering very slowly, and both of us are now really apprehensive about any further admissions.  \r\nHowever there were two staff who deserve a mention, as mum tells me they were very kind and their care was excellent. I think one of these nurses might have been the only person to actually update me on her progress once when I called, so I appreciate that.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-07-11T02:12:52.36","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-08-05T11:17:55.5","readBy":[{"name":"Scottish Government","count":1},{"name":"NHS Grampian","count":2},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/775895","id":"775895"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/775895/responses","id":"775895"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/775895/healthservices","id":"775895"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/775895/tags","id":"775895"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/n101h_502","id":"N101H_502","score":2},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/apprehensive","id":"apprehensive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20frustrated","id":"very frustrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/access%20to%20pain%20relief","id":"access to pain relief"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/analgesia","id":"analgesia"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/attitude","id":"attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cardiology","id":"cardiology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/discharge%20information","id":"discharge information"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/echo","id":"echo"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fever","id":"fever"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gynae","id":"gynae"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hospital%20discharge","id":"hospital discharge"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hysterectomy","id":"hysterectomy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/injection","id":"injection"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20knowledge","id":"staff knowledge"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20concerned","id":"very concerned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vomiting","id":"vomiting"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/family%20kept%20informed","id":"family kept informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20disappointed","id":"very disappointed"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/779433","id":"779433"}]},{"id":779418,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Professionalism with a welcoming smile.","body":"The staff and Doctor Alexandra were both totally professional and so welcoming especially in this particularly difficult time.I realise it is a cliché but that was some of the best medical customer care I have been fortunate enough to receive.

I asked was this permanent and were services moving fully to Edge Lane. I was told the receptionist couldn't answer that. I explained that I don't drive and with the current pandemic situation I wouldn't be able to safely get my daughter to the Edge Hill site (it's two busses each way or an hour-long walk) and I was pretty much told that I'd just have to find a way. It was clear that the receptionist felt this was my problem and nothing at all to do with the surgery that had quietly moved essential services three miles away. There was no empathy and no willingness to help. It's obvious that the management haven't considered accessibility for patients in the slightest. I have emailed the surgery with my complaint, especially as patients were assured this sort of thing wouldn't happen when the new owners took over a few years ago. I will be registering my family with another local GP surgery ASAP as I am not willing to drag my children across Liverpool to access services that previously were only a short walk away.

Ward clerks should be answering the calls and either finding someone to help or arranging for a call back at a convenient time.

I was seen very quickly by the triage nurse who sent me through to the observation unit at the back of the emergency department. This was a very busy space and I was put into a bed and a cannula was inserted. I was then left for a number of hours with no one speaking to me or letting me know what has happening. Eventually a Doctor came and examined me and left again. I was told very little, and what little I was told gave me the impression that I was staying in overnight with possible surgery in the morning. This concerned me somewhat. Due to the fact that I was not told anything and that I had no idea what was happening it caused me to become worried. I didn't know whether my wife would have to come and collect me or to bring me an overnight bag. This not only impacted my wife but also our neighbours as we had two young children at home who needed to be cared for should she be required to come to the hospital.  \r\nOne nurse, Arlene, spoke to me in a very kind and reassuring manner, she gave me pain killers and explained what I had to do to take them - (suppository), she answered a few questions and it was very nice to have a human touch and a feeling that she actually cared. I appreciate that the department was busy but the lack of communication from anyone was very frustrating. They didn't tell me anything, they didn't speak to me regarding what they thought was wrong with me or if I required surgery what it would be. I also had to have the COVID-19 test and again it felt rushed, impersonal and was not properly explained to me what this would involve. I asked the nurse what was happening with me and possible time frame and she said she would get back to me but never did. This was very frustrating.  \r\nEventually someone came and spoke to me around 6 hours after I arrived and asked me to go and sit in the corridor as they were moving me at some point to the Emergency Surgery Unit - one of the wards. They said I would be staying overnight - it was at this point I could ring my wife to bring me an overnight bag.  \r\nOn arrival to the ward a nurse spoke to me and did some checks but then left me. I wasn't sure whether I was allowed to get in to bed, go to sleep etc but eventually I did anyway as I was so tired. I tried to sleep but it was all but impossible due to the noise.  \r\nMy pain medication was renewed and I was told that the consultant would be with me shortly. I was still under the impression that I was going for surgery in the morning but no one had explained any of this to me or what I was being kept in for. Eventually around 8am in the morning a Dr came who spoke to me and then physically examined me. A nurse was there due to the nature of the examination and I have to say that was the first time someone spoke to me and explained what was going on and what they were looking for. The nurse was very reassuring and I very much appreciated her approach. The Doctor advised that I was to go for a cat scan and the result of that would determine whether or not I was to require surgery.  \r\nA nurse came at 11am to take me for my scan and she was lovely, She spoke to me, answered any questions I had and was a very pleasant change. I arrived for my scan and the nurse and Doctor there took time to explain to me what was happening and what they were looking for - they answered any questions I had and addressed any concerns that I had.  \r\nI was then taken back to the ward and eventually a Doctor told me that my scan indicated a slight swelling of the appendix and blocking of the upper colon. That was it. They never said I could go home, or whether I was to stay. They told me I needed no surgery. I was then given something to eat and eventually I had to phone my wife to tell her what I was told. She was a nurse and advised me to speak directly to the consultant and to ask a number of questions re my care, results and reason for staying in the hospital. This eventually happened after a number of my questions were not answered by the staff on the ward.  \r\nI also felt that patient confidentiality was non existent on the ward. The doctors and nurses openly discussed each patient, their history, current medical issues and personal details at the nurses station in full hearing of everyone on the ward. There was one particular female patient who had a number of very personal medical issues that every other patient on the ward could hear - all male.  \r\nEventually I was advised that they wished to keep me in for observation but I felt that my wife could do that at home and after raising issues advised by my wife I was finally discharged after speaking again with the consultant who at this stage was a little more forthcoming with information.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-08-03T18:18:53.3066667","progress":"Made

I wanted to leave a comment to say about the amazing care my husband and myself received while there.  \r\nWe had an absolutely amazing midwife called Bethany. She was so kind and friendly which really put my mind at ease about having to give birth haha. It turned out this was her first job post after qualifying as a midwife, I was absolutely shocked as she was so calm, confident and competent in her role. She listened to us, was very encouraging and always went through all my options, particularly surrounding pain relief which meant I never felt too uncomfortable for long. She really just did an excellent job in all departments and we want her to know what an amazing difference she made to our experience. I'm a nurse myself and definitely wasn't this good in my first job! Please let her know how great she is!  \r\nEveryone else we came into contact with was lovely also from the charge midwife, student midwives to doctors and anaesthetists. They all made giving birth during a pandemic easier than I was anticipating.  \r\nJust wanted to thank you all for the great job you do and thanks for helping us bring our son into the world in a lovely, calm and professional way!","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-08-04T03:45:18.4733333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-08-05T13:09:05.413","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Grampian","count":4},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/779135","id":"779135"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/779135/responses","id":"779135"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/779135/healthservices","id":"779135"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/779135/tags","id":"779135"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/n161h_501","id":"N161H_501","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/birth","id":"birth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctors","id":"doctors"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/giving%20birth","id":"giving birth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good","id":"good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/induction","id":"induction"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kind%20staff","id":"kind staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/labour","id":"labour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/maternity","id":"maternity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/midwives","id":"midwives"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain%20relief","id":"pain relief"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professional","id":"professional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/student%20midwives","id":"student midwives"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing","id":"amazing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/calm","id":"calm"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20ease","id":"at ease"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anaesthetists","id":"anaesthetists"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pandemic","id":"pandemic"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/779636","id":"779636"}]},{"id":779073,"author":"Biker Nicky","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Broken radious","body":"Following a fall on my bike on the Quantock Hills, I broke my radious bone and cut my knee.

The nurse Nicola scanned me and everything was fine. We could see a heartbeat. I was so relieved. I was advised to attend again for a further scan in a couple of weeks.  \r\nFast forward two weeks. I had been so sick so not thinking anything was wrong, I skipped back into the early pregnancy unit to see my baby again. I was so excited! I hopped on to the couch and could see my wee baby on the scanner. Shauna the nurse started to look and look. She kept trying different angles but neither of us could see that wee flicker of my baby's heartbeat. Shauna called for the doctor. Dr white proceeded to scan me again. In my head I was desperately hoping we had just missed it. But then I just remember Dr White's words... \"I'm so sorry.\" I just cried. I couldn't believe it! The baby measured perfectly but no heartbeat. Shock set in. Shauna was so reassuring and compassionate. My options were given to me and I was advised to call back the following day to arrange what to do next. The end of the week came and I was taken in for surgical management. Nurses Terri and Marian were so attentive. They kept me regularly informed about getting to theatre. The three student nurses were lovely. Caitlin, Carla and Chloe from Ulster University and Queens. It was great to see them teaching and supporting each other's learning. They kept asking me if I needed anything and popping in to check if I was okay. Dr Yazmin explained the procedure to me. I was obviously upset but she was very caring.The end of the day came. Theatres had been so busy that day that I had to return the following day for my procedure.I attended the next day as planned. I was seen by Dr Shafalika and the anaesthetist Dr Maha fairly promptly. I was advised that my procedure would be done under spinal which I was quite nervous about but again, they reassured me.I was wheeled to theatre by a nurse called Margaret and Dr Yazmin. In the anaesthetic room, I was met by a nurse called Natalie. I was so nervous and obviously upset but she was so reassuring. Into theatre I go to be met by Dr Shafalika, Dr Maha and a team of nurses. I just remember crying. Pure devastation set in. But a nurse called Helen said the kindest words to me that I will never forget. Her compassion and care was amazing. She made me feel like I wasn't alone, even though it is the most lonely of experiences. Following my spinal, Nurse Natalie stood by my side the whole time. Reassuring me constantly. The masks and visors didn't make a difference because I could see their smiles and kindness by their eyes. Once the procedure was completed, I went to recovery to be met by a lovely nurse called Esther. Again, Esther fully reassured me and made me laugh even. Natalie and Helen also came to see how I was doing. These three nurses provided me with such comfort and support.Helen and Esther wheeled me back to the ward, where Nurses Orla and Margaret proceeded to provide me with great care and such kindness. Mandy the HCA brought me tea and toast and chatted away to me. I was so thankful for her company and cheerfulness. I guess I am writing this to help me come to terms with all that has happened. Despite my misfortune I wanted to acknowledge the staff that cared for me. From my trauma, I have experienced the true kindness, compassion, empathy and great care from a whole team of doctors and nursing staff. Even during such difficult times, they are still providing a service which is invaluable to women experiencing this heart ache. I hope that they get to see this and that they know how truly thankful I am for their comfort and support at such a difficult time.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-08-03T23:13:50.2866667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-08-05T13:20:28.193","readBy":[{"name":"Northern Health and Social Care Trust","count":6},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2020)","count":1},{"name":"Public Health Agency","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/779106","id":"779106"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/779106/responses","id":"779106"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/779106/healthservices","id":"779106"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/779106/tags","id":"779106"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt002_21028_100","id":"ZT002_21028_100","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt002_21028_502","id":"ZT002_21028_502","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nervous","id":"nervous"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anaesthetic","id":"Anaesthetic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/caring","id":"caring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/early%20pregnancy","id":"early pregnancy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/miscarriage","id":"miscarriage"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassurance","id":"reassurance"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scan","id":"scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/spinal","id":"spinal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supportive","id":"supportive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20for","id":"cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassion","id":"compassion"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thankful","id":"Thankful"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/779776","id":"779776"}]},{"id":779078,"author":"Kelsmac","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Antenatal care","body":"It has been disjointed and extremely poorly organised.

I have enjoyed having a drink since being a teenager. I have always been a pretty anxious person and I would often have a couple of drinks to calm my nerves if i had plans for that day.  \r\nAs I got into my late 20s I realised I was drinking daily. Over the last four years or so it just escalated and gradually got worse over time. I found myself going from medium strength beer, to stronger strength cans and then mainly onto spirits. Around three years ago I realised I was dependent. I was needing drink just to sleep or to have an appetite. I felt moody if I hadn't had a drink and it was affecting my relationship and home life in general. Up until the week I started my detox I would be on 20+ units per day, I couldn't sleep for more than a couple of hours without waking up sweating, shaking, wretching and needing more drink just to not feel ill.  \r\nI contacted CGL as I was now desperate and I had an assessment over the phone with a lady called Carol. She then put me in contact me a man named Stuart. I explained my situation and how I really thought I need a detox to break the drinking cycle. He was great with me and told me he would send the report to my doctor and get back to me.  \r\nI was successful in getting a detox and the relief of that alone was massive. I knew I now had a chance to sort my life out.  \r\nI met with John three days before my detox started. He dropped off equipment and went through what to expect and that was really helpful and reassuring.  \r\nThe detox started on the Monday morning. I was pretty much out of it the first day, nodding quite alot but I felt OK and relaxed and it was going better than I had expected. John checked on me in person and we had a decent chat. Stuart was on the phone twice a day, checking on me, taking my blood pressure and temperature readings. From day two onwards I continued to take my medication and I felt fine! I couldn't believe how manageable the detox was. I was expecting a struggle and it was the opposite. I kept waiting for a bad day to happen but it never did. I was never once feeling bad.  \r\nI have now completed my detox and I feel like a new man. I am happier, I feel so much healthier, I am sleeping and eating. The shakes have gone. I am finally rid of the alcohol and I have never felt better.  \r\nA big thing I want to mention is the fact it was a home detox. With me being anxious, I would have felt so much more nervous and worried if I didn't have the chance to do it in my own home. It made it so much easier for me. Home detox should always be an option in future for people in a similar situation.  \r\nI want to say a massive thanks from top to bottom to everybody at CGL for helping me get rid of my addiction. Two people I really want to single out are Stuart and John.  \r\nStuart was great on the phone, very calming and full of knowledge. I would ask a question and he would always be very informative and always have time to speak for as long as I needed.  \r\nJohn was great and from the minute I met him I knew this guy was going to be a big help to me, and he was. He was very open and honest about his past and everything he was saying I could relate to in some way. Having somebody who was once in the position I was facing and who had overcome the same problems was a massive plus for me. John is very passionate and I can tell this is more than just a job to him and I've taken alot of things on board from what he has been drilling into me. John has offered to continue supporting me should I need it which is reassuring.  \r\nThanks for literally saving my life.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-08-04T10:37:39.4566667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-08-05T13:28:54.43","readBy":[{"name":"Change Grow Live","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/779167","id":"779167"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/779167/responses","id":"779167"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/779167/healthservices","id":"779167"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/779167/tags","id":"779167"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/nms-cglnotts","id":"nms-cglnotts","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxious","id":"anxious"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nervous","id":"nervous"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/worried","id":"worried"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/alcohol","id":"alcohol"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/assessment","id":"assessment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/calming","id":"calming"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/detox","id":"detox"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/informative%20staff","id":"Informative Staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/knowledgeable","id":"knowledgeable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ongoing%20support","id":"Ongoing support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/passion%20for%20the%20job","id":"passion for the job"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support%20at%20home","id":"support at home"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/passionate","id":"passionate"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/779436","id":"779436"}]},{"id":779222,"author":"empathykr36","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Prompt care for stroke","body":"Tingling feeling on right side of jaw in late June but no action taken.

I complained that nothing had been done to the board and was promptly seen by a psychiatrist who told me that as a charity that specialised in rape counselling had been involved and had offered me care if I hadn’t received any from the trust That I should stick with that. I told them that I couldn’t access this for months and still nothing was offered.  \r\nI got very ill and had new symptoms of hallucinations and blackouts so back to the go. The early intervention team saw me quickly And assessed me deciding I wasn’t psychotic but undergoing extreme distress and stress. I agreed with this. I received a care coordinator and only recently a junior psychologist obviously only by telephone due to covid. No assessment for PTSD even though this was what I’ve requested throughout. Still have blackouts still have hallucinations and no assessment no specialist treatment.

This time physical changes to the treated breast.  \r\nI was early but staff swiftly made me feel comfortable and tried to help. The clinic was busy but despite the fact I should have been in the clinic later in the day I was reassured and quickly dealt with. My mammogram was quick and despite thinking I would need to wait some time I was quickly placed for a further ultrasound scan.  \r\nThe nurses were so lovely. Sensitive and emotionally intelligent. I was joined by the doctor on duty - in fact the doctor that had told me I had DCIS 8 years earlier. She talked me through the scan and the reasons for the changes I was experiencing. I felt absolutely confident in her authoritative, calm and reassuring approach. The outcome for me was positive and I can only praise the staff involved. Thank you to all of them.  \r\nI would say however, I had surgery followed by radiotherapy at Maidstone 8 years ago. The treatment and staff were outstanding throughout. But, at the end of the radiotherapy I had a final meeting with someone to send me on my way. Unfortunately, they were male and I could barely understand their diction as English was not their mother tongue. It would have made so much difference to me in the years that have followed to have been talked through the changes I might expect and what should concern me to seek further help.  \r\nI remain in the care of this Maidstone/ TWells team and am eternally grateful for it.

After 2 days of inducing I was taken on delivery suite-midwifes were not bad, gave me all the information I need.  \r\nAfter 14hrs of labour I was asked to push which I couldn’t manage without help. I had forceps delivery. The midwife pass me the baby - 3 times I wiped blood that was coming out from his mouth. I asked them if that is normal but no one answered. After 45 min my son collapsed. He was resuscitated and send in Bolton for cooling treatment.  \r\nI’m so grateful for Bolton NICU staff as they were brilliant - they saved our son and they gave us as a new parents very good support. After 6 days they have to send us back in Blackpool to finish the course of antibiotics which my son had. The staff of NICU left me alone (new mum) in the room for all night baby was crying all night no one even came in our room to check if we are ok. They left me antibiotics for the little one one the table and told me to give him when I will feed him. That was shocking.  \r\nAfter 2 days the doctor came and told me we can be discharged to go home. I asked what was the level of the infection for my baby as they told me have to be below 10 in Blackpool and below 5 in Bolton! Don’t know why is so big difference! ! ! Doctor couldn’t answer my question as they didn’t know and was happy to discharge us home. I think is absolutely shocking how the nurses and doctors didn’t show us care. After this experience I will never have a more babies and I speak with all my pregnant friends to not have the babies in Victoria as my care was really poor. To be honest I don’t think if we will stay in the Vic after what happened my son will be how he is today - I know Bolton NICU did everything they could to safe him and they did.

I am deeply grateful that the staff put themselves in harm's way from Covid to help others. Covid arrangements also seem to require some dispersal of staff leading to increased hours of work.

Apologies to anyone I've missed.  \r\nI was also delighted that the bit of bone they removed can be of use to others via the Blood Transfusion Service.  \r\nPain levels in the operated leg have already been dramatically reduced and the exercises pre and post op are being so beneficial that I am already out walking short distances in the open air.  \r\nMy other hip has now also significantly deteriorated and I hope to be back soon to have it done. I'm not looking forward to it as for any operation, but the care professionalism and good humour of the staff make it so much more bearable.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-08-04T18:53:28.9133333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-08-05T14:59:54.02","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Fife","count":11},{"name":"Fife Health & Social Care Partnership","count":2},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/779284","id":"779284"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/779284/responses","id":"779284"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/779284/healthservices","id":"779284"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/779284/tags","id":"779284"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/f704h_110","id":"F704H_110","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hip%20replacement","id":"hip replacement"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professionalism","id":"professionalism"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20commitment","id":"staff commitment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thankful","id":"Thankful"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/779461","id":"779461"}]},{"id":779323,"author":"Ruperta","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Wishaw University Hospital","body":"I just wanted to thank all the staff of Ward 5 University Hospital Wishaw for their excellent standard of care during my recent stay in hospital.

Hours service at St John's Hospital, Livingston. After undergoing an initial assessment, I was transferred to the Surgical Assessment Unit at the Royal Infirmary in Edinburgh for further tests.  \r\nSoon after arrival at the Royal, a CT-scan quickly identified the problem - an episode of appendicitis. By midnight I was whizzed into the operating theatre and keyhole surgery removed the offending piece of my anatomy!  \r\nI want to use Care Opinion to share my sincere thanks for the professionalism, attention, care and compassion I experienced during my journey. The nurses, doctors and HCSWs involved in my treatment managed to balance their professionalism with genuine care - and a sense of humour! Despite feeling ++ vulnerable, the whole procedure was made so much more bearable by their approach. Thank you nursing staff on duty at St John's OOO service and the Multi-Disciplinary Team who managed my care at The Royal Infirmary.

I suffer from an extremely rare disorder and I do not cope well with change. It heightens my anxiety levels and my body does not cope well with it. So I was honestly terrified for the new change and what to expect. But I was very surprised when I arrived. I was instantly greeted with a smile from Margaret who helped get me settled in. The nursing staff are always so helpful & kind & nothing is ever any trouble to them.  \r\nThey are a credit to the NHS to the duty of care that they continually carry out each and everyday. If I could give a medal to anyone it would have to be Margaret from the care and attention she gives each individual patient. She takes the time like the majority of the nurses to explain what the care plan is and what will be happening step by step. They all introduce themselves, have a smile on their face even though they are rushed off their feet and have so many patients to look after.  \r\nI really like the layout and space in the South Tyrone Hospital. Patients are not on top of each other and there is plenty of space between each patient. Don't get me wrong I really like attending Craigavon as the duty of care from the staff there is exceptional but there is not enough space in the small wards for the patients especially to social distance with a lot of patients suffering from health complications, where their immune systems are compromised. Dungannon provides that space for patients. Because from my own opinion it makes me feel more comfortable.  \r\nThe only downside is the parking facilities and I am not close to my consultant but there are an amazing doctor and I know is only a call away and the staff keep them updated.  \r\nThank you.","criticality":"minimally critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-08-04T18:00:44.7966667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-08-05T15:26:59.477","readBy":[{"name":"Southern Health and Social Care Trust","count":5},{"name":"Public Health Agency","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/779276","id":"779276"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/779276/responses","id":"779276"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/779276/healthservices","id":"779276"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/779276/tags","id":"779276"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_31024-dcc","id":"ZT003_31024-dcc","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxious","id":"anxious"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care%20plan","id":"care plan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helpful","id":"helpful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kind","id":"kind"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/layout","id":"layout"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nursing%20staff","id":"nursing staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/parking%20facilities","id":"parking facilities"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20introduction","id":"staff introduction"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surprised","id":"surprised"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happy","id":"happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/explanations","id":"explanations"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/space%20on%20ward","id":"space on ward"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/779703","id":"779703"}]},{"id":779455,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Excellent service with good protection re…","body":"Instructions for Colonoscopy Examination did NOT contain instructions to bring slippers or dressing gown.

However, the night before this was due to take place, I started to experience contractions and went in to discuss my options. It was at this point I met Jackie, head of the Alongside Midwifery Unit. Given my history, I had considered the chances of giving birth in the AMU to be very slim however, Jackie went through all my options with me and gave me confidence that I could choose to go ahead with a natural birth and even use the birthing pool etc if I wanted or alternatively proceed with the section.  \r\nFast forward to the next day and after much consideration, we decided to try for a natural birth and gave up our slot for a section. This was an incredibly hard decision as I knew I would only be able to have gas and air given a previous reaction to diamorphine and a desire not to have an epidural following my previous complications. I should highlight that the doctor we spoke to gave us literally a minute (whilst standing outside the room) to make this decision!  \r\nFrom here I should mention the wonderful Santine who I believe played an instrumental part in our positive experience. She took us to an AMU room and sat for a long time chatting through all my concerns and options again. There had been discussion of breaking my waters given I was at 4cm and seeing whether that would speed up my contractions. Santine explained she would rather not do this as I would most likely end up in a section under this scenario and instead it would be better to leave me and see what my body would do. She put candles on, shut out the daylight and left us to get comfy and sure enough, after a couple of hours the contractions did intensify.  \r\nUnfortunately, another midwife then came on shift. We had thought everything was progressing well and I was waiting until I had reached adequate dilation to get into the birthing pool. However, I was told by this midwife there was no way given my history I would be allowed in and that I shouldn’t be in the AMU at all. Whilst I completely understand that the motivations at play here were to keep me and baby safe, this was devastating news as I had really been working through the contractions on the basis of a positive water birth. To hear I shouldn’t be in the AMU confirmed my previous negative connotations re birth and to be honest really frightened me as we were at the point of no return re a section.  \r\nFinally, just as I reached 8cm, Jackie came on shift. As soon as I saw her enter the room, a wave of complete calm came over me. She immediately came over to me and asked me to tell her what had been happening and how I was feeling. Then she took control, rearranging the room to make it more suitable. Some of the things she did were so simple but I cannot describe how big the difference they made was. She saw that to get through contractions I was listening to hypnobirthing through my earphones, but that they kept getting pulled out my ears so she brought in a Bluetooth speaker. She recognised the contractions were in my back, so she taught my partner techniques to relieve this as well as better massage techniques and breathing exercises for me. Then, after speaking with me and getting reassurances from me, she agreed I could use the birthing pool. And it was here, by candlelight with my favourite music playing that I gave birth in the single most intense and utterly joyful experience of my life.  \r\nNeedless to say, Jackie’s aftercare was also amazing, allowing myself and my husband to stay together in the room with our precious bundle and making the single best tea and toast I’ve ever had.  \r\nIn short, I will be eternally grateful for the experience I so nearly didn’t have. I was terrified after my first birth and never thought I would have a positive experience. If I had gone with the planned section, I would have undergone major surgery and added significant recovery time needlessly. Thanks to Jackie and the amazing AMU facilities, I was given the confidence to go for the birth I’d always wanted and in the end it was more than I could ever have thought possible.  \r\nIf you have the chance, I would 100% recommend the AMU. I learned later that Jackie helped design the rooms so, of course, the facilities are amazing and giving birth in the pool was incredible.  \r\nJackie, if you ever read this, thank you so much again from the bottom of my heart. You are amazing at what you do and I truly believe any woman in labour who is lucky enough to have your care will most definitely have a better birthing experience for it.","criticality":"minimally critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-08-04T03:00:54.6666667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-08-05T15:28:16.937","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Forth Valley","count":8},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/779134","id":"779134"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/779134/responses","id":"779134"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/779134/healthservices","id":"779134"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/779134/tags","id":"779134"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/forth-valley-royal-maternity","id":"forth-valley-royal-maternity","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frightened","id":"frightened"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/terrified","id":"terrified"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/aftercare","id":"aftercare"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/birth","id":"birth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breathing","id":"breathing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/contractions","id":"contractions"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/c-section","id":"c-section"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/epidural","id":"epidural"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/facilities","id":"facilities"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gas%20and%20air","id":"gas and air"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/giving%20birth","id":"giving birth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helped","id":"helped"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/in%20control","id":"in control"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/labour","id":"labour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lucky","id":"lucky"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/massage","id":"massage"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/midwife","id":"midwife"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/midwives","id":"midwives"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/partner%20accommodation","id":"partner accommodation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/positive","id":"positive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassurance","id":"reassurance"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/safe","id":"safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/section","id":"section"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/water%20birth","id":"water birth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing","id":"amazing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confidence","id":"confidence"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wonderful","id":"wonderful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/time%20given","id":"Time given"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/joyful","id":"joyful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/involved%20in%20care","id":"involved in care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/conflicting%20information","id":"conflicting information"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thanks","id":"thanks"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/779781","id":"779781"}]},{"id":779277,"author":"Sullybobo","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Breathless","body":"Have been bresthless for 3 weeks, numerous visits to doctor and hospital.

am reassured that if I ever had to return I would find myself in safe hands.","body":"I was admitted to the Observation Ward at St John’s Hospital in Livingston which comes under the auspices of NHS Lothian.  \r\nThe quality of care , kindness and support I received from all staff in the ward between Saturday 1st and Tuesday 4th August 2020 was absolutely outstanding and a credit to the wonderful institution that is the NHS  \r\nFrom Senior Staff , nursing staff , student nurses, physiotherapy staff and Auxiliary staff the care and support I received was exemplary. For someone who had never been admitted to hospital in his adult life and was very nervous as a result their kindness and support went above and beyond and helped allay my fears.  \r\nI would like to give a special mention to Charge Nurse Louise Williamson who was a huge support to me during my stay and an outstanding example of professionalism throughout.  \r\nWhilst not wanting to repeat the circumstances leading to my admission I am reassured that if I ever had to return I would find myself in safe hands.  \r\nThe creation of the NHS remains in 2020 the greatest political achievement of any UK peacetime government and an institution we must continue to fight for and support . It is great to see the staff of the Observation Ward at St John’s in Livingston flying that flag for the NHS so proudly. I will be forever grateful for their kindness and professionalism and feel it deserves wider recognition. People are often quick to moan when they have received poor service - it is really nice to be able to redress the balance!","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-08-04T15:55:44.93","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-08-05T15:47:02.943","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lothian","count":6},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/779239","id":"779239"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/779239/responses","id":"779239"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/779239/healthservices","id":"779239"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/779239/tags","id":"779239"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/s308h_180","id":"S308H_180","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/above%20and%20beyond","id":"above and beyond"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/in%20safe%20hands","id":"in safe hands"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kindness","id":"kindness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/physiotherapy","id":"physiotherapy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professionalism","id":"professionalism"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/safe","id":"safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sciatica","id":"sciatica"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/779689","id":"779689"}]}]
