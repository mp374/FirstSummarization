I wasn’t offered antenatal classes until I was around 35wks pregnant, making my child about a month older than those in my group, some are yet to give birth!  \r\nI had great experiences with other midwives from the unit, and heard positive things from others I knew that were pregnant at the same time as me, all of which had other midwives.

Upon trying to book another appointment, the online system only opens at 08.00 Monday to Friday, and as soon as the system goes online, after logging in, you are informed that the practice is at full capacity, and not currently taking any new requests. This has been the case at a couple of minutes past 8 o'clock for the past 10 days.\nAny attempt to telephone the surgery is met with a recorded message to use their preferred Anima system, but continuing with the call puts you in a queue, usually with around 80 callers ahead of you.\nThe queue slowly goes down at a rate of about 9 callers every half hour, but when my position in the queue reached the upper 40's, the line went blank for a few seconds, and then without redialling, reset my position back to the upper 80's.\nMy last remaining option was to walk down to the surgery, only to be asked by the receptionist why I wasn't using the Anima system. When I replied that I wasn't able to get any kind of an appointment online, I was told that the Anima system was working perfectly. I mentioned the problems I'd had on the phone, and was told I should have been using Anima!\nI asked the receptionist what I could do to get an appointment, and was told that there was nothing available today, and she couldn't book any other appointments. She suggested to return to the surgery in person at 08.00 tomorrow, only to be told there were again no appointments.\nIn spite of the fact that the practice is always \"at full capacity\", their huge waiting rooms are always empty.\nMy wife has had a similar experience trying to book appointments for herself, so despite being reasonably intelligent and computer literate, we've more or less given up any attempt to access NHS medical care through our GP. This practice has effectively firewalled itself behind the Anima computer system, long queues on the phone, and a receptionist who is unable to make appointments.\nNHS111 are not able to help with high blood pressure as this needs the attention of a GP.\nWe will not attend A&E to receive treatment, as we are neither an accident nor an emergency.\nHaving both paid National Insurance contributions all of our working lives, we find that now, at 70 years of age, we are effectively being denied medical care by way of having no access to a GP.\nI know we will only receive the usual generic, cut & paste, computer generated reply that other patients have received, as I really don't believe that a real person ever reads these reviews.\n","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2023-04-24T11:42:16","progress":"Story has a

Had the next scheduled for dec which I had to cancel due to covid and I was informed I'd get another through the post. This didnt happen and I had to call for one. Got another appt for march where i just sat outside xray for an hour then had to leave as i rely on public transport and live in Middlesbrough (I did ask for an earlier appointment due to this factor along with the fact I am my sons carer and was refused), so I was informed I'd get another through the post, still hasnt happened. I called last week and got told theyve been off over easter - still no appointment. \n\nThe person dealing with me knows I have a loose tooth, looks like I'll be losing it doesnt it.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2023-04-24T13:10:41","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-04-25T12:01:54","readBy":[{"name":"The Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1058514","id":"1058514"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1058514/responses","id":"1058514"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1058514/healthservices","id":"1058514"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1058514/tags","id":"1058514"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rtd04","id":"RTD04","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/factor%208","id":"factor 8"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/informed","id":"informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tooth","id":"tooth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/xray","id":"Xray"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid","id":"covid"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%2019","id":"covid 19"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/like%20myself","id":"like myself"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1065420","id":"1065420"}]},{"id":1058526,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Phlebotomy team","body":"Had a blood test today at Royal Liverpool and had a fantastic experience.

It took 10 years to finally be passed from GP (constant \"do pelvic floor\" leaflets) to being referred to Katie - stress incontinence physio who was great.  \r\nOnce finding out had I had prolaspes and that my pelvic wall was fine, I got to see a consultant who's manner and way was horrible.  \r\nTheir registrar gave me my 3 bulked injections, they were lovely, then wanting a more permanent fix, met Dr Sokolva who was absolutely unreal. They listened and understood how this is effecting me, and understanding a more permanent fix was necessary, put me on their waiting list (unfortunately covid happened) but when I met them again on the day of my surgery, I felt like they remembered me even though it was 3 years later. They went over everything again in detail, and advised me of all risks involved, their style of communication is great, I honestly would have trusted this doctor with my life (well I did) and I don't know if they understand what this actually means to me.  \r\nI'm only 2 days post op, sore but good, my life can finally begin again and I will be able to do all the stuff I loved before.  \r\nWhen I think of the rude consultant, people like that shouldn't be allowed to be in that profession, no people skills, and I feel had an absolute disrespect for patients.

I have been having chronic pain and it was near getting to the stage where I couldn’t walk so they had to bring me into hospital to be checked.

I can’t just thank one member of staff as all has been great. The small gestures that they do is what makes it like there was a time I was dying for a drink of water so I informed one of the nurses about this and they brought me up a full jug straight from the fridge which was nice and cold just the way I like it and I found this to be quite lovely of them to do this.  \r\nPeople are always so quick to give negative comments about our NHS and never as quick to give a compliment.

I got online, and was thrown out before I could complete my booking, a matter of some 3 minutes, as the system was full and all appointments had gone. So I joined the queue on the phone to be told \"there are currently more than 60 patients ahead of you\", and the surgery is no longer operating a call back service, nor accepting \ne-consultations. When I finally got an appointment, I arrived 10 minutes early only to wait until a half hour after my appointment time before I was seen. I hasten to add, the staff and GP's are fine, but it couldn't be more glaringly obvious that this surgery, and Forest Gate, are grossly understaffed and unable to provide the service they themselves are capable of as a result.
