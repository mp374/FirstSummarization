[{"id":899203,"author":"travellergy68","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Positive home birth","body":"We gave birth at home on the 12th of November. I had anxiety about the birth nearer the end of pregnancy due to a bad experience with an anaesthetist. I was never an at risk during pregnancy, yet he made me feel as if my choices about my body were wrong. The phonecall I recieved from the anaethsetist was after the consultant agreed to support me and my decision.  \r\nI was 35 weeks pregnant by this point and did not need the stress. The support I received from the community midwives was outstanding though. They were supportive and helped ease my anxiety. The majority of my appointments were with one midwife and the continuity helped me so much. They listened to me and helped me to have confidence in myself and that it is ok to trust my own body. They had agreed to be on call for me for my planned home birth. One could not attend in the end but her boss came instead.  \r\nIt meant everything that in every step of the way they trusted me to be in tune with my body, and in turn this helped me have the phsiological birth I dreamed of having at home with no interventions. We feel very grateful to have had the midwives we had at our home, and it made our experience so positive in the end. I dread to think how badly I would have been feeling right now had I listened to other people, rather than trusting my own body to do what it was made to do.  \r\nThank you so much to the Hawick community midwives. They are heroes to us.","criticality":"minimally critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-11-29T21:49:53.98","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-12-01T09:34:33.287","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Borders","count":3},{"name":"Office of Colin Smyth, MSP for South Scotland","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/899203","id":"899203"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/899203/responses","id":"899203"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/899203/healthservices","id":"899203"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/899203/tags","id":"899203"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/b120h_501","id":"B120H_501","score":4},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxious","id":"anxious"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20being%20listened%20to","id":"not being listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scared","id":"scared"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/worried","id":"worried"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anaesthetist","id":"anaesthetist"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/birth","id":"birth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/continuity","id":"continuity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/delighted","id":"delighted"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dread","id":"dread"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ecstatic","id":"Ecstatic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/midwives","id":"midwives"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pregnancy","id":"pregnancy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pregnant","id":"pregnant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/respect%20&%20dignity","id":"respect & dignity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/respected","id":"respected"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/respectful","id":"respectful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happy","id":"happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/relieved","id":"relieved"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported","id":"supported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/on%20edge","id":"on edge"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sad%20angry","id":"sad angry"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/trusting%20patients","id":"trusting patients"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/trusted","id":"trusted"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/899766","id":"899766"}]},{"id":899129,"author":"Lynchie60","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Outstanding care","body":"I received a Colonoscopy from Dr Bayaty's team.

My problem relates to procedures, not people. The people are great, and I am pleased to have had my covid booster jag.  \r\nLast week general booking for covid booster jags opened here in Scotland for my age cohort (40-49 year olds). We were encouraged to use the NHS website to book a booster jag at any time from 24 weeks after the second dose. I did so immediately, for a date 24 weeks to the day from my second dose.  \r\nYesterday, the JCVI brought this forward to three months following the second dose, in the face of the omicron variant. I immediately rescheduled my appointment, finding one available in walking distance the following day.  \r\nI did have the sense, given the line of questioning at reception, that I was in some way jumping the queue - in spite of bookings being open for my age cohort and very specific advice from the JCVI. The receptionist was great about it, and I think there was a sense in which she had to tick a box on the computer, but I was very uncomfortable.  \r\nI am autistic, so I am perhaps oversensitive to the suggestion that I have done something wrong, because this happens all the time, but my reading of the situation is that I was following the advice of the Health Secretary, the National Clinical Director (who is presumably advising the Health Secretary) and the JCVI.  \r\nI see no information to the effect that I should wait for a specific invitation, as was the case for my first two doses. Official advice, including the NHS website, seemed very clear that I should use my initiative, but I was, as mentioned, left with the impression that I should have waited until some unspecified time in the future.  \r\nI understand that the present situation seems to be leading to changes on an almost daily basis, but I would hate for this kind of incident to lead to a situation where people are left disinclined to request vaccination, so perhaps something needs to be done about these procedures.  \r\nTo add to the suggestion that there is a problem with procedures, I have just, six hours *after* my appointment, received email confirmation of it.  \r\nThis is not a complaint. I am not upset with the receptionist, who presumably had a box to tick, but if I did something wrong by following what I thought was official vaccination advice (and it's certainly true that I often misinterpret the way neurotypicals think and act), then the advice needs to be clarified. If I didn't, then the line of questioning needs to be changed in order to reflect that.","criticality":"minimally critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-11-30T17:29:45.82","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-12-01T11:34:28.563","readBy":[{"name":"Office of Annabelle Ewing, MSP for Cowdenbeath","count":1},{"name":"NHS Fife","count":7},{"name":"Fife Health & Social Care Partnership","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/899512","id":"899512"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/899512/responses","id":"899512"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/899512/healthservices","id":"899512"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/899512/tags","id":"899512"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sf9-covidvacs","id":"Sf9-covidvacs","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/booking%20process","id":"Booking process"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly%20staff","id":"friendly staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/procedures","id":"procedures"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/receptionist","id":"receptionist"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/uncomfortable","id":"uncomfortable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vaccination","id":"vaccination"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid","id":"covid"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%2019","id":"covid 19"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/901209","id":"901209"}]},{"id":899526,"author":"SBara","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Community Therapy services","body":"My husband has MS and is unable to walk, He uses a wheelchair.  \r\nHe can walk 5 to 10 steps with stick.  \r\nHis left side is powerless and numb.

I was told I would be staying and directed to a bench seat along the corridor in early afternoon. By midnight, both myself and the other 5 patients were very uncomfortable. I was in considerable pain and was getting as much pain relief as was allowed on a bench seat by the red CDU area- holding all Covid patients. The night shift staff nurse grabbed any trolley that had just finished being used and got us on as she was so upset that we were all due surgery - on the emergency lists and on bench seats.  \r\nBecause I was on a trolley, the next morning, I still was unable to receive iv morphine as the nurse on duty stated I wasn’t safe enough being on a trolley in the corridor. The staff were truly busy and, with no ward bed available, I was rolling around my trolley until the afternoon when I was brought up to 4 North.  \r\nI received immediate iv pain relief and, although I still had a couple of days wait for surgery, I was much more comfortable. My day nurse for Wednesday through to Friday was Sheena, an extremely empathetic and professional staff nurse. She was my advocate when I was unable to have a conversation with the consultant, she was my advocate when I went for my operation but was sent back as my allergies had been overlooked and the operating theatre required a latex clean.  \r\nSheena really looked after me and that care had such an impact. I was treated as me- an individual who, during that time was the most important person to her. I also watched her dry a patients’ hair who was post op. Sheena deserves thanks and recognition for her care. Alongside was a mature 2nd year student nurse from Omagh - Roland?? He was a man who used his initiative and, although his second day there, alerted staff when an observation reading required immediate action. When a case of Covid happened in the bay next to me, the cleaning staff were fast and thorough.  \r\nAfter my operation, the Reg agreed to my remaining overnight. The following day, my consultant wanted me to go home that afternoon. I knew I was unwell and the weekend staff agreed- they spoke to the senior member of staff, and I remained. That night I developed sepsis and the night nurse - with light red hair who had already been concerned the previous night about sepsis by my obs, worked quickly with the doctor to bring down a heart rate in the high 200’s as well as low bp and very high temp. They were reassuring but very efficient.  \r\nThe next day - Sunday, my consultant advised me I had sepsis and I had a catheter inserted by a very reassuring nurse. I was nervous, very ill and worried. The staff were calm and reassuring. That same day one of my swabs gave a positive Covid result. The staff nurse was apologetic but explained I would now be transferred to a Covid ward 3 north. To say I was worried was an understatement. I should not as staff like Grainne were efficient and supportive throughout the remainder of my 2 week stay. The most terrific medical team are in 3north. EhJay the friendly consultant- who took the time you required to discuss your case with you and my favourite Nigerian reg who was always in the ward. She took time to sit with patients, encourage them to eat or take their pills and had the most infectious laugh. She was great at getting blood from arms so covered in bruises that veins were illusive. There were many other day and night staff who were also terrific on 3north like Amanda? I really appreciated the fact that nursing staff continued to be advocates for patients when busy surgical teams did not always see the whole patient- this I also observed in 3north.  \r\nFinally, my terrible veins caused issues and I required anaesthetics to come down with a scanner twice finally putting in a mid-line instead of a cannula. The lady was lovely and very reassuring, explaining all throughout. Also two ladies from the phlebotomy dept I believe one was M Brennan - noted as the best there is, made my final cannula insertions so much less uncomfortable and achieved first time!

I began attending aged 49 with 40 + years of traumatic events that I had buried deep away and then menopause had tipped me over the edge and brought it all to the surface. I struggled every day with the simplest of tasks and felt overwhelmed to the point of incapacity and felt I was slowly losing more of me each day. I felt hopeless and helpless and didn’t want to communicate or have any contact with anyone, I wanted to be alone in my bedroom most nights.  \r\nThis is where Jenny comes in. She straight away put me at ease and I felt I could tell her anything. Very quickly she had me down to a tee and it felt like she knew me better than I knew myself. Her caring manner professionalism and intuition were first class and whilst I knew the journey was going to be excruciatingly difficult, I knew it was going to be okay in the end because I trusted her completely and knew I was in safe hands.  \r\nShe was always caring compassionate and understanding and never pushed too far but also knew when to accelerate when needed. Sometimes I felt she had a crystal ball because she always “just knew” and would say the right thing.  \r\nFast forward 18 months and I feel like a new person. Everything in my life is better because I am better and that’s all thanks to Jenny. No more isolating myself to avoid people, a lot less aches and pains because my body isn’t stiff from anxiety and stress, I have found out I quite like myself and feel very proud of myself instead of feeling disgusted by myself and feeling unworthy of my place on earth. My whole outlook has changed and my coping capacity is humongous now.  \r\nI will practice self care regularly and check in with myself on a regular basis. I wish I had done this sooner but better late than never and they do say life begins at 50; mine certainly has thanks to Jenny.  \r\nI do hope Jenny’s manager will see this. I am sure she already knows what a superstar she has in Jenny but I honestly cannot find the words to explain the difference she made in my life and in turn all my families life as I know they are so happy with the better improved version of me they have now, so please praise her as highly as you can, she is worth her weight in gold.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-11-30T20:05:36.2633333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-12-01T13:57:57.697","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Forth Valley","count":6}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/899577","id":"899577"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/899577/responses","id":"899577"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/899577/healthservices","id":"899577"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/899577/tags","id":"899577"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/falkirk-ch-woodlands","id":"falkirk-ch-woodlands","score":5},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sv9-community-services-cmh","id":"SV9-community-services-cmh","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/caring","id":"caring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cognitive%20behavioural%20therapy","id":"cognitive behavioural therapy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helpful","id":"helpful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/improved","id":"improved"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/physcotherapy","id":"physcotherapy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professional","id":"professional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/understanding","id":"understanding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassionate","id":"compassionate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/trust","id":"Trust"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/self%20care","id":"self care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20at%20ease","id":"put at ease"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/intuitive","id":"intuitive"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/899793","id":"899793"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/899814","id":"899814"}]},{"id":899578,"author":"IainKB","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Comfortable and reassuring surgery","body":"This was my second visit to Leicester as previous admission date was cancelled after I arrived due to unavailability of ICU / HDU beds which would be a requirement after my scheduled operation. This almost happened again but, thank goodness an ICU bed was secured at last moment so operation was able to proceed. I has become quite nervous  about the procedure due to the long wait but was reassured by surgeon, anaesthetist & ward staff who all showed fortitude, empathy & understanding under difficult circumstances; i.e. the uncertainty of beds being available due to highly busy times.\nOperation went ahead & throughout the pre-operation procedures; e.g. fitting of epidural tubes etc., all theatre staff were cheerful & supportive helping to alleviate my worries.\nNest thing I remember is waking up in recovery where staff were immediately available to reassure me that all had gone to plan & that I was going to be OK.\nI had been worried that I would be feeling very sore & uncomfortable but the pain relief measures were superb & I just felt sleepy & comfortable.\nAfter 3 days I was transferred onto a ward where I continued to be kept comfortable and reassured. \nWard staff were all good, some outstanding, as were physio's & the Stoma Nurses. I had a few difficult days where I felt a bit depressed & had appetite issues but staff did all they could to be encouraging.\nThere seemed to be a lot of different doctors / consultants etc. who came round over the next several days but I was happy with the information they gave to me & with their attitudes & confidence that I would soon be better & would be able to cope with some necessary lifestyle changes.\nHaving come through a major procedure I am just thankful that we have such skills available within the NHS; ie. the skill of the surgeons & the professional yet friendly skills of all nursing & other support staff.

There was also concern that her blood pressure was extremely high for someone with no history of blood pressure problems. My gran was put into a trolley in A&E, nursing staff who were very kind to my gran and myself were coming in to do basic observational checks on her, due to her blood pressure still being high, throughout the night until the Dr came in at 07:30 (almost 8 hours after she was admitted to the department).  \r\nMy first concern is that despite the nursing and auxiliary staff being lovely, although I understand they were very busy, at no point did anyone offer my gran anything to drink, when my gran required to use the toilet (on multiple occasions) she was offered the use of a commode the first time by an auxiliary who assisted her but after this it was left to myself to assist her. This was very upsetting to my gran as she is a proud, and private, woman. I do appreciate that the department and staff are very busy, but if I had not been there with her she would never have spoken up as she doesn't like to bother anyone.  \r\nWhen the Dr came to assess my gran he was very thorough in his questioning, I appreciated that he took my views and concerns into account as my gran had become a little more confused of late. However, when I spoke to him of my concern about her blood pressure being high (at one point her reading was 232/109 and did not decrease much lower than this throughout her admission) the Dr told me he was not overly concerned about her readings and suspected that her blood pressure would normalise on its own. I found this hard to agree with as she is over 80 with some underlying health conditions and to have a consistently high blood pressure for a sustained period of time is not good for her. However, the Dr agreed that she would need to be admitted for further observations and physio referrals due to her unexplained falls.  \r\nIt was almost 6+ hours, a move from A&E to a holding bed in treatments whilst awaiting a bed in a ward, a visit from the physio and another Dr before we were advised that my gran was in fact not going to be admitted (despite her blood pressure still being high), she was to be sent home with some house aids, a referral was to be made for her to get a MECS alarm system installed and advised to contact her own GP with regards to her blood pressure. No discussion about medication management for her blood pressure, discharged with the advice that due to her age that she needs to be more careful.  \r\nThankfully we were able to get an appointment with her own GP quite quickly, he checked her blood pressure and unsurprisingly it had not gotten better, in fact it was even higher than before . Her GP immediately admitted her to her local hospital (Royal Alexandria Hospital, Paisley) where she was kept for 2 days, monitored and medicated until her blood pressure returned to within a normal limit, discharged with medications and follow up with her own medical practice.  \r\nIt is gravely concerning that an elderly woman was allowed to be discharged from FVRH with consistently high blood pressure which could have caused life changing harm, if not lost her her life if left untreated.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-12-01T00:18:19.08","progress":"Change planned","dateOfPublication":"2021-12-01T16:14:07.517","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Forth Valley","count":8},{"name":"Scottish Government","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/899586","id":"899586"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/899586/responses","id":"899586"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/899586/healthservices","id":"899586"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/899586/tags","id":"899586"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/forth-valley-royal-ae","id":"forth-valley-royal-ae","score":3},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/accident%20&%20emergency","id":"accident & emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20pressure","id":"blood pressure"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/commode","id":"commode"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/elderly","id":"elderly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/falls","id":"falls"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly%20staff","id":"friendly staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/high%20blood%20pressure","id":"high blood pressure"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hydration","id":"hydration"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/long%20wait","id":"long wait"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/physio","id":"physio"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/poor%20discharge%20arrangements","id":"poor discharge arrangements"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thorough%20examination","id":"thorough examination"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/toilet%20facilities","id":"toilet facilities"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/listened%20to","id":"listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bit%20frustrated","id":"bit frustrated"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/900358","id":"900358"}]},{"id":899587,"author":"bwbcobffs","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Access to Mental Health services","body":"I was in hospital twice over the last week with mental health problems.

I went to LRI A&E on the evening of the 10th October 2021. Initial booking in was good but then the next step into the ambulatory department was not as easy and I lost about 30 minutes by not hearing my name called out. I am slightly deaf and when you arrive, you are given a number. On the 1st stage, the number flashes up if you haven't heard your name but on the 2nd stage nothing. Nurses were calling from behind the wall that formed the corridor into the department making it even more difficult. Calling by numbers would be easier to hear but maybe less personal but making the 2nd set of boards the same as the first would be better. Once through the doors, I couldn't fault the service. I was seen by a Clinical Practitioner who wasn't going to let me go until he/she fully understood what was wrong with me. None of this \"just take paracetamol\" and come back if it doesn't get better. He/she was intensely thorough. Blood tests, CT scan and X rays all done in the early hours of the morning, all by very friendly and professional staff. I was released from there at around 6.00am armed with antibiotics and clear instructions on the process going forward and what to do if various symptoms came back. Couldn't fault the service this time.

She then says “well there’s 2 people on the desk” when I ask how the slots have filled that quick. Well, if you have an afternoon clinic telling patients to call at 2 there should be appointments available at 2. Therefore, I then told her to get a GP to call me and she said “well answer the phone”. To which I told her where I work has low signal, and the doctor I usually speak to is aware of this and understands so rings more than once if she can’t get through at first. Not too sure why I have to speak to the receptionists quite harshly to get an appointment. A few weeks prior to this, I stood at the desk for 10 minutes whilst the 2 receptionists had a conversation amongst themselves, it would have probably been a longer wait only I asked them if they were going to see to me at any point.

support from staff at sexual heath clinic","body":"i went to the sexual health clinic because i felt like my IUD might have moved.\ni was very stressed by the possibility of the IUD being out of place and needing further treatment & also because i have had very bad experience with gynecology exams in the past (to the point of having PTSD because of what gynecologists/nurses did to me).\ni did not know that this clinic had no walk-in and had no appointment booked but the staff managed to find a slot in between patients for me.\nthe Dr who saw me was very respectful and supportive when i mentioned being so stressed by internal exams.\n\nshe was very supportive and respectful during the exam and gave me very clear explanation of the results afterwards. every one that i saw at the clinic was very nice to myself and other patients.\n\nthe place seemed very empty, probably because of covid. it felt very safe covid wise with all the distancing and also good for confidentiality (they call you by a number rather than your name, have separate waiting rooms so that not everyone is seeing all other patients).\n\npossible improvements:\n- offer all patients up front to chose the size of speculum they want, do STI swab themselves, insert the speculum themselves, be in alternative positions... rather than rely on patient to (know they can) request this.\n- put the examining table further away form the wall so that patients can to the \"butterfly\" with their legs for the exam rather than have feet/legs on stirr ups\n- be more mindfull about making patient talk about previous abuse they might have suffered. asking about in the writen would be less distressing for many patients and i would suggest adding a question/box for patient to say if they want to discuss it with professional or not during the appointment so that they don't end up having to answer questions that might distress them if they don't want to on that day, put a question asking if they know where to get support for this and another asking if they want the clinic to provide them with information on where to find support. professionals should realise that this is very distressing to talk about, for some patients this was years ago and they don't need nor want to bring it up every time they go for an appointment, it can make the appointment more difficult as it will get the patient triggered with bad memory from having to speak about it again and also importantly this is patients story so they should not be put on the spot to tell it but be free to decide when they speak about it or not. the answer is not to ask every patients if they have suffered this but to assume most patient have and offer extra sensitive care as default to everyone.\n- the registration form had a typo: it said \"gender: male/female/non binary\" gender is feminine/masculine/non-binary (not male/female).\nthe staff made this very stressful and triggering time much better by being respectful, compassionate, patient and adaptable.\nthe opening time of the clinic (all day until 7pm) is very convenient","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2021-11-30T23:40:38","progress":"Story has a
