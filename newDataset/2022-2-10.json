Which means admission to hospital because there is no crisis team that will go to her in time. And these crisis houses here don't take anyone with psychosis.  \r\nShe lives on her own and self neglects. We cant get near her when she is very paranoid and frankly we are sick to death of being dumped on for years and years by this Trust who have never had the workforce in place to support very unwell patients.  \r\nIt is not our job to look after our mother as the crisis line worker told my brother. It is appalling that this Trust expect us to put our entire lives on hold to provide the 24 hr care they should be doing. If they went in to her before she got so unwell then she wouldn't end up barricaded in her home with police smashing the door down (as now) and still no mental health assessment. We as family don't have any break and we have to try and hold down jobs, pay mortgages and rents and have children to care for AND provide acute mental health crisis care 24 hrs a day until we cant get access. There was NO mental health services during the entire pandemic ( and please do not tell us otherwise when we know her community team haven't made contact since her last section ). We are sick of the excuses the complaints managers post . Everything from where sit is toxic and rotten and dangerous and we don't think for a moment that these crisis services and wards and sectioning teams care the slightest or they would have improved the quality of frontline staff and more importantly the managers. This has gone on or at least 10 yrs now..  \r\n2 of us are NHS nurses so we know what good care looks and sounds like and we know what dangerous decisions are. We concur with every criticism voiced by others on this site because at some point or another over time we as family or my mum as the patient has experienced the same.  \r\nWe post here not because we believe for a minute they will change but to stand in support with other families and patients who have been left in this position.","criticality":"strongly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-02-03T21:02:27.4066667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-02-10T09:56:07.05","readBy":[{"name":"Camden and Islington NHS Foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/913918","id":"913918"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/913918/responses","id":"913918"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/913918/healthservices","id":"913918"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/913918/tags","id":"913918"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/taf","id":"TAF","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/attitudes","id":"attitudes"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/management","id":"management"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health%20crisis","id":"mental health crisis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/governance","id":"governance"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/risk%20assessments","id":"risk assessments"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professional%20standards","id":"professional standards"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/922442","id":"922442"}]},{"id":914993,"author":"Hils 1951","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"The service I received was exceptional","body":"The service I received was exceptional.  \r\nThere were three staff at the Day surgery unit where I had my small operation, who treated me with such care .  \r\nI cannot thank them enough as throughout the procedure they kept me entertained with their good humour .  \r\nPlease pass on my heartfelt thanks to all of them (Dr Scott, Lynn & David).  \r\nThey made my experience so easy .  \r\nKind Regards","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-02-08T18:51:38.2833333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-02-10T09:59:15.067","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Forth Valley","count":3},{"name":"Office of Michelle Thomson, MSP for Falkirk East","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/914993","id":"914993"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/914993/responses","id":"914993"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/914993/healthservices","id":"914993"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/914993/tags","id":"914993"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/forth-valley-royal-day-surgery","id":"forth-valley-royal-day-surgery","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/all%20staff","id":"all staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/day%20surgery","id":"day surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/exceptional%20service","id":"exceptional service"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good%20humour","id":"good humour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20for","id":"cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good%20experience","id":"good experience"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/entertaining","id":"entertaining"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/917057","id":"917057"}]},{"id":914994,"author":"woodpeckergt68","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Feeling positive about my future","body":"I had a serious drinking problem which was effecting ever aspect of my life.

He was reassured this would not be a problem - and then was called this morning and told his procedure would have to be cancelled and a further wait of 6 weeks endured, due to his positive covid test. Not only had he gone through the mental and physical preparation required for this but this is now the second time the procedure has been cancelled on the day. The first time, he was not given the appropriate preparatory medication at the pre-op clinic.  \r\nWe are both understanding of the huge pressures the NHS is currently under (I am an NHS employee myself) however, a lack of due care and attention has now resulted in tremendous upset and inconvenience for us and 2 wasted appointment slots for this procedure.

Within 20 minutes he changed significantly for the worse becoming hot and flushed and his temperature rising to above 39 degrees Celsius he was tired and listless and clingy towards me his breathing becoming rapid and laboured.  \r\nI was very concerned and took him to the paediatric ward in Daisy Hill Hospital, my local hospital, where he was taken on to the ward by Siofra, Deputy Sister, in charge at the time. We were brought to a side ward and made comfortable and he was seen by Dr Nicola who prescribed a course of treatment. Nicola explained what was happening clearly and concisely using language that I understood, while Ciara and Shauna, two of the nursing team, took obs and prepared and delivered the treatment.  \r\nAnd as he hadn’t improved any after the first course of treatment Nicola prescribed a second dose and put him on oxygen.

Through out this experience I was reassured, informed and put at ease by these professionals who worked together seamlessly to provide such excellent care.

At almost every turn where consent was required it felt like it was always coercive bullying to get what the nurses wanted done. Even when I rang in to say my waters had gone, as had my mucus plug, and I was having contractions 5 mins apart, when I got to the hospital I was told I needed to be examined internally to make sure I was in labour. When I declined this as is my right (due to previous severe life changing trauma- again due to no consent)- advocating for myself- I was treated like I was committing a crime and did not deserve any help. I was then treated like a problem rather than with support and told well if you don’t let us check then we don’t know where to send you so I was just left in the waiting room asking/begging for some gas&air- which I didn’t get. Apparently as I wasn’t screaming it meant I couldn’t be in pain or labour. After begrudgingly making me wait for half and hour I was sent to the labour ward so they could decide what to do with me instead as I was wasting a bed apparently - whereby I could feel the baby starting to come.Thankfully the midwife I had in the labour room gave me gas & air as soon as I asked and 20 mins later my baby was born. While in the labour room the midwife gave me all the time I needed and asked what I wanted to do before sending me upstairs to ward 5 ensuring they knew I would need extra help due to my medical conditions regardless of having a normal vaginal delivery. Once on ward 5 I was seen for an obs checks once, and offered water in a jug and my child was seen to once by the hearing check nurse. Other than that I was left to get on with it, with no one checking on me to offer any help, support or assistance. There was another lady on the ward who was checked on constantly the entire time I was there, yet no one thought to check in on me.I struggled with breastfeeding due to not being mobile due to my medical condition and my baby struggling to latch and still am now at home. Even though my midwife had informed the ward that I needed rest until I was ready to go home, I was still asked if I was ready to go home later that evening. The next day again I was left to tend to myself. The one time I pressed the buzzer as something had fallen onto the floor into the next bay, the healthcare worker came to pick it up for me but was all huffy about doing it for me with a disgusted look on their face. So I didn’t bother pressing the button again. The health care worker was also the one who did the food round and was clearly very polite and friendly when asking the other lady what food she wasn’t for lunch/dinner- but completely cold and annoyed when asking me. The next day- I was given my medication by a nurse who said my first name only didn’t check any other details with me and left some pain relief but not the other medication that had been prescribed for me. They came round later to give me the other medication that should have given alongside the pain relief, but it was someone else’s antibiotics instead. I asked why I was getting antibiotics all of a sudden. They addressed me by a different name, so I said that isn’t my name. They ran off with the antibiotics but I still never got my other medication. Later on in the day I asked for some stronger pain relief as I was told this was an option available for me to get prescribed. The nurse who I asked said that I was not prescribed it. I said I know, but I was told I could get it prescribed when I needed/wanted it. They never came back with the pain relief- again I was forgotten. I didn’t have anyone come check on me till the next morning (while I was in pain all night) when the healthcare workers came to ask if I wanted breakfast. The same day after shift change a nurse walked in and just abruptly starting questioning in a slightly angry tone why I was still there and hadn't gone home, and that it was a 6 hour turn around. I was shocked and couldn’t believe I was being spoken to like that and it made to feel absolutely horrible. I told the nurse that it should say on my notes why I’m still here, but they started waving a paper saying it says nothing on here. I had to explain it all and they walked off not happy with my explanations or reasons. I was made to feel so low and underserving to be there even though I was not even pressing the buzzer to ask anyone for help. This happened again with another health care worker who was also annoyed that I was still there and had to offer me food. I decided to ask to be sent home while still struggling to get my baby to latch and suffering with pains and still not able to be mobile due to my health condition. The midwife who did my discharge paperwork was lovely and tried to help with the latching but as my discharge paperwork had started I didn’t have enough time to get to a place where I wasn’t struggling. Horrible experience.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-02-09T10:18:21.1033333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-02-10T10:59:30.553","readBy":[{"name":"University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/915238","id":"915238"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/915238/responses","id":"915238"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/915238/healthservices","id":"915238"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/915238/tags","id":"915238"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rrk98-maternity","id":"RRK98-maternity","score":1},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/antibiotics","id":"antibiotics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/contractions","id":"contractions"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/delivery","id":"delivery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/forgotten","id":"forgotten"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/horrible","id":"horrible"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/in%20pain","id":"in pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/informed%20consent","id":"informed consent"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/labour","id":"labour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/midwife","id":"midwife"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurse","id":"nurse"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain%20relief","id":"pain relief"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pregnancy","id":"pregnancy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/rushed","id":"rushed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attitude","id":"staff attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unsupported","id":"unsupported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vaginal","id":"vaginal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breast%20feeding%20support","id":"breast feeding support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/health%20care%20workers","id":"health care workers"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/left%20alone","id":"left alone"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/918335","id":"918335"}]},{"id":915243,"author":"loveht49","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Handled very maturely","body":"I visited due to my partner receiving a positive result for an STI.

I had phoned my GP but with current restrictions it is difficult to get a face to face appointment. Initially I was given a phone consultation for 2 weeks time. Time went on and I wasn't feeling any better. I'm a fit person who runs 3 to 4 times a week and I was struggling to even walk very far without being out of breath. A week had passed and I phoned the GP surgery again and asked if I could see someone, again I was told there were no appointments but someone would phone me back. Diane (Nurse Care Practitioner) phoned me back and gave me an appointment that day. I was seen by Dr Simpson, who was very thorough and gave me antibiotics, requested bloods to be taken and referred me for a chest x-ray. I went for my chest x-ray on the Thursday, which I thought was going to be a straight forward process. As soon as the x-ray was taken the radiographer said I had to go to A&E.  \r\nOnce in A&E, Dr Lee, the emergency consultant, advised me that I had a right-sided pneumothorax, which was a bit of a shock. He was very good at explaining everything and what needed to happen. A chest drain was inserted and nurse Lisa held my hand through the procedure. I had a bit of a wait in A&E after the procedure but was grateful I got at bed in Dr Gray's. Once on Ward 5, the staff were great, nothing too much trouble. I spent a few nights on the ward and as a member of staff (non-clinical) it gave me a different perspective on what happens on a busy ward.  \r\nThanks to all the staff at Dr Grays, A&E, Dr Lee, Lisa and others, for keeping me calm and the staff on Ward 5, Alana, Steve, Fiona, Alice and Kelly (student) who had only been there for a few weeks, who was amazing with all the patients!  \r\nThanks again to Dr Gray's Hospital for looking after me, much appreciated.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-02-09T11:14:15.04","progress":"Story has a

Throughout my wait for the procedure no one discussed what was to happen, when and where and by who. I was marked up by the Consultant and another person in scrubs but I did not get know who that was - neither spoke to me. I was called through to the prep room where I was treated well, but again very little mention of what and who regarding the procedure. I was wheeled in horizontally and spun around noticing a female in a mask who did not introduce themselves, nor let me see who they were and she proceeded to operate on me. I was asked once if I was ok throughout. It was apparent that the Consultant intervened at the end. On finish I was patted on the shoulder and asked to go back to waiting room. The attendant walking back with me commented that I was a bit slow and wobbly! No consideration was given to how mI may feel especially having heart failure and AF and how this might compromise my ability to 'jump' off the table to walk quickly back to recovery.  I was given refreshments while I waited. One nurse wore a mask (Covid protection) under her nose throughout her time on the unit - one rule for some!! I was given some medication with no reason for its use given, and sent to find my own way out.\nClearly the team had setup a process that would enable them to turn around the 5 patients in a limited time slot for the theatre - what they forgot to do is realise the 'patients' are human beings.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-02-09T20:54:48","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2022-02-10T12:13:53","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/915630","id":"915630"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/915630/responses","id":"915630"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/915630/healthservices","id":"915630"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/915630/tags","id":"915630"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rwy02","id":"RWY02","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cataract","id":"cataract"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cataract%20surgery","id":"Cataract surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/failure","id":"failure"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/heart","id":"heart"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/heart%20failure","id":"heart failure"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mi","id":"MI"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nose","id":"nose"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/shoulder","id":"shoulder"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/well%20treated","id":"well treated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid","id":"covid"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%2019","id":"covid 19"}]},{"id":915347,"author":"castorbd97","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Done a brilliant job","body":"Podiatry at the Causeway Hospital in Coleraine is a very good service.

The team arrived just as we were trying to get mum back to her chair in the living room - it was good that they saw exactly what was happening and he home circumstances. They did all the tests and arranged for mum to go into hospital the next morning - I stayed overnight - I got very little sleep.  \r\nWhen Mum came home the discharge to assess team supported her until she was able to manage dressing, toileting + preparing food herself. She still has support in the morning, and exercises to do so that she manages the zimmer + rollator better.

I have since requested my notes and discovered what might be at the root of this experience.  \r\nI was admitted to hospital as a result of three falls at home and being in a state of confusion. I was subsequently diagnosed with a urine infection. This is documented in the hospital’s admission notes.  \r\nHowever on my personal care plan across the topics of “mobility” and ‘personal hygiene” is scrawled “INDEPENDENT”. “Falls risk” is described as ‘LOW RISK”. This is repeated on each daily care plan until after my first fall. Interestingly on the heading of the care plan “Discussed with patient on...” is left blank.  \r\nFor me this raises a huge question as to what information this care plan was based on.  \r\nI have fed this back to the ward manager and she assured me this would be discussed with staff.

However, there is a big difference now - we have the bestest support from the kindest team at Inclusion on the IOW  \r\nIt all began in the summer of 2019 when we realised the extent of my Son's alcohol addiction... it was sad to think that what we thought was just Uni fun had now become a serious problem. Nevertheless, we grouped together as a tight knit family, closed ranks, and started the rehab process as we thought this would be the best way to help this intelligent, sensitive and very worthy young man who had just completed his Masters Degree and had a whole world waiting out there to explore. Little did we know that it was not so easy. The next 2 years were a roller coaster ride for us all. My Son went from alcohol to cocaine and finally ended up using heroin. It was absolutely heartbreaking to witness with our own eyes the deterioration of this smart young man and we as a family were riddled with grief as we watched this tragedy unfold in front of us and with guilt too as we found ourselves with limited resources to help him in any way.  \r\nThen everything changed for the better when we got our first appointment with Inclusion and had a home visit from the lovely Caroline. She took my Son under her wing and from then on, we had real help for the first time ever and it was amazing! She got him introduced to the AA program on the Island and this was a good turning point. Soon however, there was a not so good turning point and my Son suffered a set back. This time, due to his age, we had the adult services kick in and it was the most wonderful Aaron who took over his case. I cannot begin to express our overwhelming gratitude for Aaron's involvement and the brilliant support that his team have offered not only to my son but also to me.  \r\nAlong with getting my Son the help he needs and monitoring this, Aaron has always been there for me too... A shoulder to cry on initially, an ear to listen always, a mind to advise when needed and a professional to follow through on all fronts!! All these saviours encapsulated into one is Aaron! I feel so very thankful for my good fortune to have met him!! Now, at long last, I feel I can get my personal life back on track knowing my Son is in the safest hands possible!!  \r\nIt won't be an exaggeration to say that having Aaron on board has not just saved one life but many more.
