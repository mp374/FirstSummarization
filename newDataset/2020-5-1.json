Any time I attend the surgery, I actively avoid the reception and attempt to use the self-service device wherever possible. They show utter annoyance at answering any questions and talk to you in a condescending and irritated tone, like you're stupid for even asking anything. I now feel some anxiety every time I have to call and often use the Islington Hub service instead, just to avoid this awful interaction with The Northern Medical Centre's reception staff.

I also informed the staff I was 14 weeks pregnant. I was told to contact my GP service. I contacted my GP practice and explained that I was informed I could not receive my next injection. The receptionist was very helpful & discussed my issue with a GP who said I should have my injection given I was pregnant. The receptionist then booked my appointment with the treatment room nursing team for today. I was very relieved.  \r\nYesterday the nursing team contacted me to inform me the appointment would be a home visit and to check I had no Covid-19 symptoms. I then received no further contact from the treatment room until 3pm today when I contacted them to ask if a nurse was coming to my house. I was told they would phone me, I still haven't received any call from the treatment room nurses. I was contacted by a GP who informed me current guidance was I could miss this injection and get the next one, I explained this wasn't acceptable to me given I would experience symptoms which I didn't believe was appropriate given I am currently pregnant. I found the GP to be patronising and had a lack of care for my circumstances and feelings, they only seemed interested in guidance not my care. The whole event has left me stressed and upset.

I feel the lack of communication regarding the cancelling of this vital (to me) service disappointing.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-04-30T18:22:11.51","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-05-01T12:39:39.717","readBy":[{"name":"North Lanarkshire Health & Social Care Partnership","count":1},{"name":"NHS Lanarkshire","count":2},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":2},{"name":"Partnership for Change","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/759499","id":"759499"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/759499/responses","id":"759499"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/759499/healthservices","id":"759499"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/759499/tags","id":"759499"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sl9-gp","id":"sl9-gp","score":1},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disappointed","id":"disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stressed","id":"stressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/b12%20injection","id":"B12 injection"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/patient-centred","id":"patient-centred"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pregnant","id":"pregnant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/receptionist","id":"receptionist"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassion","id":"compassion"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/conflicting%20information","id":"conflicting information"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/759589","id":"759589"}]},{"id":759500,"author":"Fantastic CPN service","authorRoleId":3,"authorRole":"a parent/guardian","title":"Mental health services","body":"My son has been receiving care from the CPN service in NHS Dumfries and Galloway for several years.

Recently due to Covid-19, mental health services took the decision to discharge a significant amount of their client base ensuring us that they were only at the end of the telephone. Due to be furloughed my son has been struggling and I have gained knowledge, guided my Emma of signs of crisis and today took the decision to call the service. I was delighted to learn that Emma had not been deployed and was still available to us so emailed her with details of how things were at home. At 7pm I received a call from Emma informing me that she had discussed my email with her team leader and my son’s consultant and the decision was to offer him an appointment on Tuesday. Amazing, first class, personable service! I cannot thank Emma enough.

The staff were amazing and although busy always had time for you and I felt very well looked after while there. They were thorough checking my bloods and any abnormalities as well as ensuring I was able to eat and drink before being sent home, they certainly did not rush this and with two extra scans and the correct medication I was sent home when they were sure I was well enough and not before.  \r\nAlthough this was in Aberdeen the rest of my care was with the Peterhead team of midwives. Again all staff I had any dealings with were friendly,professional and always helpful. At all times I felt like they were understanding of any concerns or enquiries I had and were always happy to help or reassure me. My own midwife who I saw for routine appointments was especially so. From ensuring I was as well as possible by getting the correct medications (especially with the hyperemesis and later with acid reflux), to arranging all aspects of my home birth and helping with questions or concerns I had, I again always felt well looked after and that when it came to me and my baby they were happy to help.  \r\nAlthough I was given a tour of the labour rooms at Peterhead, which were tempting to go for as they looked a lovely place to give birth, I decided to opt for a home birth. Again all questions I had regarding this were answered in a supportive and positive manner. Nearer the time my midwife visited my home, discussed my plans then arranged for everything we needed for the birth.  \r\nWhen it came to labour my midwife was on call and was at my home within 30mins of phoning Peterhead and the second midwife was just a little after that too- thankfully as baby made a quick appearance so we didn't have much time to play with! I cannot rate my home birth experience highly enough, both midwives were professional, supportive and reassuring throughout and very much were led by my wishes in my birthing plan. This was during a time when co-vid 19 meant many of us had concerns and worries about how this would affect our labours, however my experience was extremely positive. All staff throughout my pregnancy, birth and first few days with baby deserve to be thanked and praised as I feel I had a great level of care thanks to them all!","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-04-30T20:36:46.0266667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-05-01T12:47:08.767","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Grampian","count":3},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/759503","id":"759503"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/759503/responses","id":"759503"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/759503/healthservices","id":"759503"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/759503/tags","id":"759503"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/n161h_501","id":"N161H_501","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/n333h_501","id":"N333H_501","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/acid","id":"acid"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/answering%20questions","id":"answering questions"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/birth","id":"birth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helpful","id":"helpful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hyperemesis","id":"hyperemesis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/labour","id":"labour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/maternity","id":"maternity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/midwives","id":"midwives"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pregnancy","id":"pregnancy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pregnant","id":"pregnant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professional","id":"professional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reflux","id":"reflux"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thorough","id":"thorough"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/understanding","id":"understanding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/well%20looked%20after","id":"well looked after"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing","id":"amazing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happy","id":"happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassuring","id":"reassuring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported","id":"supported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/time%20given","id":"Time given"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thanks","id":"thanks"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/759594","id":"759594"}]},{"id":759528,"author":"Phoenix69","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Surprised admission to HDU ward","body":"Having collapsed during the night, my partner convinced me to go A&E early the next morning as I was still in pain.

Whenever possible I was asked for my views / agreement. Courteous, caring and compassionate staff. I can feel completely confident that he received the best of care. I think that during these very difficult days , the effort put in by all staff who spoke to me was outstandingly good. My thanks, my family’s thanks to all the staff.

He went to Ipswich Hospital last week because the carer called the doctor as he’d slept all day and it was difficult to rouse. In context however, with my Mum being taken by paramedics to A and E with severe atrial fibrillation at 2am that same day it’s not surprising he was extra tired, but decisions had been made when I arrived at the house. He *had* been getting progressively more sleepy the past fortnight but he is nearly 93 and has advanced dementia, so I had’t been unduly worried.  \r\nDad was taken to A and E by ambulance as the paramedics suspected he’d had a TIA - he was awake when he left us. No one was allowed to go to hospital with him, he was not allowed to take anything in, but despite the paramedics taking my number and being aware of the situation when he was admitted, twice I was told (by an A and E Dr. and a Brantham Ward nurse) they thought my mum was still in hospital, and that no one had a contact number for me. I have both financial and health and welfare Power of Attorney for both my parents and it’s vital that information is passed on accurately. They also thought it was his third admission yet he hadn’t been in hospital for over 45 years and never in Ipswich…  \r\nThe assessment unit STILL thought mum was in hospital and whilst waiting for the CT results they told me he was going to Washbrook Ward, which was a green ward. They told me I “was lucky” the referral to the ward had been accepted - which I thought was odd at the time. We were still under the impression they thought he had had a mini stroke at this point. It was tough getting info but apparently they did a chest X ray (routine I think?) and we were told it was clear later and all his tests were normal. I did ask on Saturday if his CT scan did not show a TIA, if he had a clear chest X Ray (no chest infection), his blood test inflammatory markers were ok and his urine sample was clear as we'd been told and he’s been assessed by the therapy team then surely he should be home? It didn’t even sound as if I was speaking to someone about the right patient - reduced oxygen levels were mentioned but we’ve not been told he’s ill?  \r\nThen on Monday we were told the x ray was not clear and they thought he had COVID, he had a temperature and his oxygen levels were low so he was to remain in until at least Friday. However only an hour later the ward consultant called me the chest x ray was fine, he hadn't needed oxygen and they didn't think he had COVID - and indeed he had tested negative. Anyway we were told he was safe on a GREEN ward, which was actually incorrect, it turned out later the ward was a red COVID ward!  \r\nI called so many times, different info every time, he had a temperature, didn’t have a temperature, needed oxygen, didn’t need oxygen, he was happy, he was agitated and very difficult to manage… I explained he was very, very confused at the best of times but they said he had 1:1 care because he was the only patient on a bay of 6 beds so I expected them to be looking after him. The therapy team called on Saturday and were helpful, we discussed what his usual state was etc and I believed they were still trying to determine whether he had had a TIA, whether he was worse than usual and when he could come home. The lack of information was frustrating, but theMISinformation was infuriating.  \r\nThen we had a call Monday to say he was going to a “bridging” assessment bed before a care home as it was unsafe for him to come home. Bearing in mind we had not seen him, he had nothing familiar with him etc it's not surprising he was so confused, no one knew why he’d been admitted and assumed it was his delirium. They were *still* basing decision making on incorrect info that it was his third admission, mum was in hospital etc. I explained *again* that this was all incorrect, that whatever happened going forward he had to come home first and this was agreed after literally hours on the phone. I was told there had been some \"misinformation\" by the physiotherapist who said we should have had a call from the DIST team prior to this.  \r\nHe came home yesterday and oh my GOD what a state he was in. Covered in poo, no shower or shave for 5 days, and worst of all covered in severe bruises, plus three dressings on his arms for skin tears. He was exhausted, shaking and in a bad way. It took nearly 2 hours to get him upstairs and showered, he was very frightened. He shouted when touched and was in pain - NONE of this was the case before admission.  \r\nWe were told discharge was conditional on a package of 4 x daily care and the care team who came the first night from the hospital were horrified, and said we must complain. The ward staff cannot explain how he hurt himself, and apologised, said he had been restricted to bed because it was a COVID ward and I assume he is now stiff and has lost mobility as a result. They told me he had 1:1 observation so I asked why that person could not have called to ask what he needed, what might help etc. This is a very difficult time for the NHS, we totally appreciate that but the ward was quiet, there was no excuse for not supporting him appropriately - particularly at a time when no family contact was permitted!!  \r\nToday we learned from the new carers that we have 3 days-3weeks care MAXIMUM, and 3 x 1/2 hr visits only. We were told to cancel our pre-existing care package and are going to be left stranded. We have no care for morning showers now, and in any case you cannot get dad in the shower in half an hour!  \r\nWe want to know the following:-  \r\n1) Why was the info passed on from the paramedics disregarded? Why were the corrections I gave not recorded?  \r\n2) Why was he admitted if his CT did not show a stroke?  \r\n3) Why was he admitted to a \"red\" ward? The ward sister said he showed no obvious signs and they were quite good at spotting those with COVID.  \r\n4) Why were we told he was admitted to a green ward?  \r\n5) Why were we persistently told conflicting information?  \r\n6) Why was a discharge plan made without our involvement to a care home, based on inaccurate info which I had repeatedly corrected?  \r\n7) If he was the only patient on a 6 bed bay how on earth did he get so injured? If it is age related etc why do the experienced community care team think we should complain ?  \r\n8) WHY were we told to cancel pre-existing care and promised 8 WEEKS of 4 visits daily? Care team say this happens all the time, the hospital promise things they can’t deliver - but we never asked for care and should not have been told to cancel pre-existing care.","criticality":"strongly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-04-29T13:11:08.89","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-05-01T14:03:46.52","readBy":[{"name":"East Suffolk and North Essex NHS Foundation Trust","count":1},{"name":"The Stroke Association","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/759271","id":"759271"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/759271/responses","id":"759271"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/759271/healthservices","id":"759271"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/759271/tags","id":"759271"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rde03_180","id":"RDE03_180","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rde03_430","id":"RDE03_430","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confused","id":"confused"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frightened","id":"frightened"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frustrating","id":"frustrating"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/worried","id":"worried"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bruises","id":"bruises"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ct%20scan","id":"CT scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disregarded","id":"disregarded"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/elderly","id":"elderly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/integrated%20care","id":"integrated care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mobility","id":"mobility"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/oxygen","id":"oxygen"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/patient%20records","id":"patient records"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/skin","id":"skin"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/temperature","id":"temperature"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tia","id":"tia"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vascular%20dementia","id":"vascular dementia"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/family%20kept%20informed","id":"family kept informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/conflicting%20information","id":"conflicting information"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/misinformation","id":"misinformation"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/759597","id":"759597"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/759626","id":"759626"}]},{"id":759602,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Very caring ","body":"My stepfather has been in this care home for over 6 months.

She kept trying to outsource my treatment to other places and refusing to book the appointment, or postponing saying she wouldnt book it then but that I could come back another time to book it. I patiently explained that i would still wish to book it now and I am aware that it takes some time to get appointments, especially after regular working hours. She said in an angry tone \"oh no it doesn't\". Of course in the end the earliest appointment they had was in a week's time so there was no need to be rude as my concern about the waiting time was justified. Even if it wasn' though she still had no justificarion for being rude.

Under the current circumstances and the strain that this pandemic is putting on the NHS I cannot thank them enough for the speed that they diagnosed, treated and gave follow up care.  The team were all so lovely, professional and caring.  They could not have treated me any quicker or any better.  They all did a fantastic job & thanks to their swift treatment I can honestly say that I am feeling 90% better after just 7 days from having the blockage removed.  I will unfortunately have to have my gallbladder removed in the future but for now I’m on the mend.  We all know the great work that the doctors, nurses & everyone else that work within the hospital do on a normal day but at this time there is nothing normal about the amazing work they’re all doing.  You put your life on the line every day to help care for us with our many different problems & I thank you because without you I would still be severely jaundice, in constant pain and discomfort, not able to eat or get out of bed!!\nYou are all amazing super human hero’s and I hope you all stay safe & remain healthy.

I was eventually diagnosed with tonsillitis on the Friday of the 3rd week and given antibiotics.  Unfortunately by the Sunday I was poorly that my parents made the decision to take me to A&E as I couldn’t even tolerate water!  When arriving at A&E I was out in the urgent waiting area, I must have looked very poorly.  Within an hour I was called into cubicles where 2 nurses assessed me and told me that my tonsils were so swollen and infected that they were touching and had closed my airway and I was borderline sepsis.  I was seen within 5 mins by a doctor who gave me IV antibiotics, steroid injection and I have no idea what else.  I was put on oxygen to make sure I was able to breathe.  He told me I needed to be admitted and would be transferred by ambulance due to my compromised airway to wolverhampton as there was no ENT admittance at Russell’s Hall on a weekend.  I was so poorly that I didn’t care what they did to me or where they needed to send me.  I was just so grateful that I was actually being taken serious and was getting the treatment that I so desperately needed.  I have suffered from tonsillitis since I was a child but I have never experienced anything like this and had my parents left it another few hours then I don’t know what would have happened but I genuinely believe that the outcome would have been very different & I would have been septic!!  \n\nThe staff were all amazing, including the receptionist that made the decision that I was so poorly that I needed to be seen urgently.  That decision was the difference from being seen within the hour and waiting up to 3 hrs for “normal” waiting time on that afternoon.  I did say thank you when I was well enough after being released from hospital where I spent 4 days with chocolates (which is always a winner) but I want to show my gratitude again to the amazing NHS staff. Your fast action and professional I believe literally saved my life and all from tonsillitis. Thank you, thank you, thank you xx","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-04-30T14:51:15","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-05-01T16:24:15","readBy":[{"name":"The Dudley Group NHS Foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/759628","id":"759628"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/759628/responses","id":"759628"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/759628/healthservices","id":"759628"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/759628/tags","id":"759628"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rna01","id":"RNA01","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/antibiotics","id":"antibiotics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/borderline","id":"Borderline"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ent","id":"ent"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/infected","id":"infected"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/infection","id":"infection"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/injection","id":"injection"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/iv%20antibiotics","id":"iv antibiotics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/normal","id":"normal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/oxygen","id":"oxygen"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sepsis","id":"sepsis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/throat","id":"throat"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tonsillitis","id":"tonsillitis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tonsils","id":"tonsils"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing","id":"amazing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gratitude","id":"gratitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/septic","id":"septic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/saved","id":"saved"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/769171","id":"769171"}]},{"id":759630,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Best blood test","body":"I want to leave feedback for a recent blood test appointment with Nurse E . - Best blood test ever!

My most anxious times are when I have to reorder my stoma 'gear'. Over the years I have tried various methods and had some big disappointments, sometimes having to reorder because the prescription has been lost in transit. The fear is always that I will run out of one of the many accoutrements that are necessary.  \r\nSince Trupti took over and I send in my request to her, the prescription gets sent regularly and quickly and the acknowledgements come through very quickly as do the parcels. I have told Trupti how grateful I am and for doing her job so well but she says it is just her job, I want her managers to know how grateful I am. For me, having suffered many failures on the prescription front over the years it is a massive relief to find a sytem through Trupti of solving my anxiety and producing the goods with what is proving to be a fail safe system! !  \r\nThank you for helping me.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-04-28T10:39:11.58","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-05-02T12:20:00.587","readBy":[{"name":"City & Hackney GP Confederation","count":2},{"name":"Lower Clapton Group Practice","count":3}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/759081","id":"759081"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/759081/responses","id":"759081"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/759081/healthservices","id":"759081"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/759081/tags","id":"759081"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/f84003","id":"F84003","score":5},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rqxm1_104","id":"RQXM1_104","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bowel","id":"bowel"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bowel%20cancer","id":"bowel cancer"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cancer","id":"cancer"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/efficient","id":"efficient"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/me","id":"ME"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/truth","id":"truth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/relieved","id":"relieved"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/768736","id":"768736"}]},{"id":759701,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Great Service","body":"Very good, professional service, would like to thank all the staff and highly recommend.
