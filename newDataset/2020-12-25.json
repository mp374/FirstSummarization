I was referred to the Shirley Oaks Hospital to have this procedure completed. The initial consultations and preliminary checks were quite positive, with the Consultant being friendly and informative, and nursing staff who completed other assessments, presenting as thorough and competent.  \r\nI thought I would be in very good hands and be looked after well for the procedure and in the aftermath, especially as this is a private hospital, but my faith was somewhat misplaced, unfortunately. Whilst the surgery itself went relatively smoothly, I was really quite ill afterwards, to the point that I was unable to stand up without starting to black out. Despite this, and narrating this difficulty to staff (and in fact, staff seeing this for themselves), I was put under considerable pressure to get up, get moving, and frankly, to get out. There did not seem to be much if any understanding on the part of the nursing team (with the possible exception of one nurse) that I was not faring very well after the operation, and after slightly over 24 hours later, I was sent home. This was without any explanation as to what recovery time could be, or acknowledgement about how much internal work had actually taken place through surgery. (It was only 2 weeks later that the nurse at my GP surgery explained this all to me, whilst she was removing my stitches).  \r\nThe aftercare was pretty shoddy. After getting home, I was shocked to learn that I could not lie down - and this was a problem for 2.5 weeks afterwards. Why was I not forewarned that this might happen? (A simple Google search told me that this was a possibility). Why was I not forewarned of the fallout of having a general anesthetic (i.e., intense fatigue for 3-4 weeks afterwards?).  \r\nThe experience, despite starting off with promise, was disappointing to say the least, as I was very much made to feel that I should have made a quicker recovery and should not be wasting a bed space. It is a sad story indeed, that a sick patient's wellbeing is treated as secondary. This is made all the more insulting as I am a health care professional myself, who strives to put my patient's feelings at the heart of everything I do. It's very basic really.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-12-17T15:52:54.86","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2020-12-25T12:20:04.707","readBy":[],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/811467","id":"811467"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/811467/responses","id":"811467"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/811467/healthservices","id":"811467"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/811467/tags","id":"811467"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/y05988","id":"Y05988","score":2},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/insulting","id":"insulting"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sad","id":"sad"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/shocked","id":"shocked"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/aftercare","id":"aftercare"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bladder","id":"bladder"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bladder%20removal","id":"Bladder removal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/clean%20hospital","id":"clean hospital"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fatigue","id":"fatigue"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gall","id":"gall"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gall%20bladder","id":"gall bladder"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gall%20bladder%20removal","id":"Gall bladder removal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/heart","id":"heart"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/operation","id":"operation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"}]},{"id":811772,"author":"chassisym58","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Phone left to ring endlessly","body":"Have had bad experiences with Westrop Surgery for years.

We were with mum all day yesterday, she is very poorly, kept being sick and if dad and I weren't there yesterday, she would have been in a right mess, and there would have been a right mess all over the sheets and floor, if she had been on her own.  I'm sure she knew we were there as she did manage to open her eyes a few times and mumble something.  My sister has come down from the Lake District to see her and took my dad to the hospital today (who is 85yrs old and has been married to mum for 58yrs, never been apart) only to be told they are not allowed to see her.  Not even for a few minutes, as they had gone there.  He is distraught and to think that my mum, who is realistically not going to pull through, is there on her own.  Surely you can show some compassion for both the patient and their spouse.  It is heartbreaking to see my dad in tears, his world has fallen apart in the matter of 24hrs.  He is in total shock.  Come on please, have some compassion.  Why were we told yesterday we could visit and nothing was said when we left last night about not being able to visit.  He needs to spend the final days with mum.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-12-23T13:49:37","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-12-25T20:04:54","readBy":[{"name":"North West Anglia NHS Foundation Trust","count":2},{"name":"The Stroke Association","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/813089","id":"813089"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/813089/responses","id":"813089"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/813089/healthservices","id":"813089"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/813089/tags","id":"813089"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rgn80","id":"RGN80","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/eyes","id":"eyes"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stroke","id":"stroke"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/816137","id":"816137"}]},{"id":813090,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Telephone appointments","body":"I understand because of Corona virus telephone appointmentds are being encouraged which makes perfect sense.

The few little problems I have encountered have been on the admin side. For instance, there was a reluctance to set me up to use online patient services, which would be useful for ordering repeat meds. When I subsequently ordered meds via email, my request was rejected but nobody contacted me to tell me it had been rejected or why. And because I am not set up to use online services, I received no notification via that route either. It was only several days later, when I contacted the Pharmacy, that I discovered there was a problem. Several days were therefore wasted.

Due to my own previous experiences of this procedure, I had a little concern but knew the importance of it taking place for me, and I felt the Doctor understood this. It all went very well. I had a follow up appointment a couple of weeks later and met with a different Doctor who examined me and we agreed all was well. Unfortunately a few weeks later, due to the coil moving slightly out of place, I was able to receive another appointment to have another refitting. This was with the follow up Doctor at the same clinic. Again I experienced wonderful care, given with respect and dignity. We discussed my situation, I felt able to be very honest about it and felt I was listened to, as I had been in the previous appointments. The procedure was carried out with great care and efficiency. The clinic functioned remarkably well given the current Covid restrictions placed on the NHS, all of which were adhered to by all Staff.

They answered the phone straight away, the receptionist listened to my concerns, spoke to a consultant for me & booked me in there and then for a last minute scan. When I arrived, I was really nervous as this was the first scan I’d ever had & I had to go in on my own due to COVID! However, the staff couldn’t have done more to make sure I was at ease with the whole process. The nurse who triaged me was really friendly, and the two doctors who performed my scan were very patient considering I was a nervous wreck and they did everything to make sure I was happy and comfortable throughout.

Before 2011 this clinic had dedicated career mental health experts at all levels, most with compassion for patients. They concientiously observed, recorded and anticipated patient difficulties. They encouraged and included patients' perspectives on their own condition and needs in clinical decisions and reviews etc. Since 2011 gradual decline into dysfunction. Plenty of cold staff over years who look the other way rather than help desperate patients. Camoflaging discharge of patients as \"care\" or \"help\" is common. So patient and family is unware they're being exited. Staff avoid input with patients' GPs, including around discharge. Patient friends here gave up their long fought for places at clinic because their clinician was \"dismissive\" or \"hostile\" towards their needs. They would rather leave permanently than face that so-called care input for one more day. If you know anything about your own condition (via other agency patient education efforts) you will be the least popular patient with staff there. Rare good staff leave inside a year or 6 months. Clinic assigns longterm to autistic or personality disordered patients staff with no mental health training or experience drawn from NHS fields like physiotherapy. Your mental health can become so bad you have no memory of when you last ate and lost all natural sense of thirst - and ask your psychiatrist where you can find help for that, and be angrily told \"How do I know - you have to stand on your own two feet!\"  Self and others at this clinic have been lied to and decieved many times. Admin and clincial input so dysfunctional for so long (months/years) that we break down in tears with relief with rare good staff. Who soon leave. I can confirm the truth of all other patients' comments on these review pages. Patient perspectives on own health and circumstances is often openly and actively refused, refuted or not recorded. There is no accountablilty or appology for the most appaling breaches of the Trust's or NHS rules and guidance. If you have disabilities, or potentially lethal health conditions, you can look forward to staff standardly not being told those, not considering them, or not including those in their referals to other staff or NHS faculties, contrary to NHS guidelines. The above deficiences (polite term), and too many others to list here, are likely to cause you to leave with worse mental health than when you arrived.

Getting appointments was always fairly easy and I generally knew the GPs’. Most importantly it worked hard to understand patient needs and seemed genuinely keen to offer an accessible, friendly service that provided continuity of care across the practice.\nSince being run as part of a group of practices the service has declined markedly and rapidly. As others have said, it is almost impossible to get an appointment. I know none of the doctors and they change regularly. At my last appointment I told the doctor. That I was allergic to the medication offered but I was prescribed it anyway. I have lost count of the times I have been promised a call back only to suffer deafening silence. Communication generally is awful. For example I did not know that flu jabs were being offered. I rang to check only to be told there were none left - I went to a pharmacy instead. I dread to think how they will manage with Covid vaccinations.\nI understand that we have experienced very trying times that have put huge pressures on health services but many of the problems seem to me to result from a culture of organisational apathy. One of my friends has already moved to a different practice while at least one other is considering it. Because I have lost all confidence that I can get adequate care I too am considering my options.\nIt is so sad that what used to be an exemplary heath service is now so ineffectual.\nI would give no more than one star and that seems quite generous.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-12-26T13:08:05","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-12-26T20:16:34","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/813144","id":"813144"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/813144/responses","id":"813144"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/813144/healthservices","id":"813144"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/813144/tags","id":"813144"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/c82103","id":"C82103","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sad","id":"sad"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/allergic","id":"allergic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/continuity","id":"continuity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/group","id":"group"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pharmacy","id":"Pharmacy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confidence","id":"confidence"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/no%20confidence","id":"no confidence"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/813616","id":"813616"}]},{"id":813138,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Fantastic staff on ward 19","body":"Never visited but mum is being looked after so well by an amazingly caring and kind team\nThank you to you all\nYou are angels and more\nXx","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-12-26T18:00:21","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2020-12-26T20:17:08","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/813138","id":"813138"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/813138/responses","id":"813138"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/813138/healthservices","id":"813138"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/813138/tags","id":"813138"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rwy01","id":"RWY01","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/well%20looked%20after","id":"well looked after"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"}]},{"id":813148,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Grear experience, friendly and helpful staff ","body":"Great experience, friendly staff very helpfull nevee had any problems with booking appointments or face to face or phone call","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-12-26T11:52:38","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-12-26T20:35:20","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/813148","id":"813148"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/813148/responses","id":"813148"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/813148/healthservices","id":"813148"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/813148/tags","id":"813148"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/m85124","id":"M85124","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/face","id":"face"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/817600","id":"817600"}]},{"id":813149,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Fantastic practice","body":"This is a great practice with sympathetic and professional staff.

I hope you are all looking after your own health and mental well-being.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-12-26T19:51:35.49","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-12-27T14:32:37.903","readBy":[{"name":"Northern Health and Social Care Trust","count":7}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/813129","id":"813129"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/813129/responses","id":"813129"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/813129/healthservices","id":"813129"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/813129/tags","id":"813129"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt002-ch-mau","id":"zt002-ch-mau","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/feeling","id":"feeling"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kept%20informed","id":"kept informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thanks","id":"thanks"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid-19","id":"covid-19"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/no%20hope","id":"no hope"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/813222","id":"813222"}]},{"id":813155,"author":"Pupslup","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Prostate cancer","body":"It all started so well before the covid19 took off early detection and follow up but because of covid and the high chance of contracting virus treatment has unfortunately been delayed but I am positive things will be back on track for treatment.

Most importantly they have done things that I couldn't do due to not being able to visit eg get my dad to sign cards and then sending them to my mum as well as make special occasions more memorable when my mum could visit such as their wedding anniversary.  \r\nThe leadership in the ward is obvious, with senior staff wanting what is best for their patients and their families through engagement in new initiatives which is essential in advanced dementia care. It was lovely as a family to be contacted by the staff about the \"Playlist For Life\" and us all thinking about music dad had enjoyed over the years. This connection with dad, while none of us could visit, allowed us to feel involved with his care.  \r\nThough I cannot currently visit my dad it is reassuring to know he has such a committed team of staff taking care of him and for that I am very grateful.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-12-27T10:00:30.6966667","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2020-12-27T14:38:18.117","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Fife","count":8},{"name":"Fife Health & Social Care Partnership","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/813157","id":"813157"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/813157/responses","id":"813157"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/813157/healthservices","id":"813157"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/813157/tags","id":"813157"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/f805h_430","id":"F805H_430","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dementia","id":"dementia"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/effectiveness","id":"effectiveness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/end%20of%20life","id":"end of life"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/family%20involvement","id":"Family involvement"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/included","id":"included"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/involved","id":"involved"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20commitment","id":"staff commitment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassuring","id":"reassuring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/satisfied","id":"satisfied"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/valued","id":"valued"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pandemic","id":"pandemic"}]},{"id":813170,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Flu vaccination ","body":"Just wanted to say how impressed I was with the system in place for the flu jab\nStraight in friendly staff done and straight out in minutes fab service keep it up Danbury ","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-12-27T10:32:31","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-12-27T14:45:21","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/813170","id":"813170"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/813170/responses","id":"813170"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/813170/healthservices","id":"813170"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/813170/tags","id":"813170"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/f81100","id":"F81100","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/impressed","id":"impressed"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/849043","id":"849043"}]},{"id":813169,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Great a&e but terrible after care ","body":"Back in march I had a bycicle crash which resulted in a fractured collarbone.

The nurse at the x-ray section was not gentle at all she pull my broken arm in few directions although i was in extreme pain.\nThe doctor who looked at the x-ray in a&e told me it was a dystal fracture and fragments of bone were floating around but a specialist will contact me to let me know if surgery needed.\nNext day I was contacted by the virtual fracture clinic and been told that I will not need operation and I have been given a list of exercises to do from day 0 up to 12 weeks. After 3 weeks i was supposed to have a check up x-ray which didn't happen due to covid... I have followed all the instructions to the letter. And over the summer took things really easy with painful episodes thinking is normal giving the area of the fracture . In September after I started my job full time the pain started also to be unbearable having to stop for long periods of time. I have contacted the fracture clinic and been referred to a specialist after 2 weeks. During this visit i have faund out that my collarbone is still very much broken and now i need surgery to put plate in and possible bone graft.. The specialist who seen me at the time has explained to me all my options and put me on urgent waiting list. I have been told i could wait up to 12 weeks. 8 weeks have been and gone with no news. I am in constant pain and I cant sleep very well. Called hospital and my gp but no one seems to know anything, only been prescribed strong painkillers for the foreseeable future.... This is something which could have been avoided if the follow up x-ray would have happened. Beeing self employed this is very much affecting me not only financially but also mentally. I was out of action for months when this happened and now i struggle with daily activity which will eventually be followed by another recovery period....","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-12-27T12:28:19","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-12-27T14:45:35","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/813169","id":"813169"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/813169/responses","id":"813169"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/813169/healthservices","id":"813169"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/813169/tags","id":"813169"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rwf03","id":"RWF03","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/arm","id":"arm"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bone","id":"bone"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bone%20graft","id":"bone graft"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/broken","id":"broken"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/broken%20arm","id":"broken arm"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/collarbone","id":"collarbone"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/crash","id":"crash"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fracture","id":"fracture"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good","id":"good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/normal","id":"normal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/operation","id":"operation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/painkillers","id":"painkillers"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/periods","id":"periods"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/x-ray","id":"X-ray"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/815012","id":"815012"}]},{"id":813168,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Great ","body":"Had Revision Hip Replacement 2 weeks ago , From 1st Appointment to having Operation everything was Spot on.
