The following day, the physiotherapist , Kathryn and occupational therapist, Margaret, visited him and assessed his needs. From the outset they were both very professional, helpful and compassionate and it is clear that they see the person behind the disability. Kathryn had her last visit with us today and while we are delighted with the progress that my husband has made, we will both miss Kathryn’s visits to our home. She has given him great confidence with his mobility which is helping him to be more independent. She has been like a breath of fresh air.  \r\nEqually Margaret has been a tremendous support in helping to arrange for a handrail at our front door, giving advice on a wheelchair and getting a bed rail , these things are making such a difference for my husband at a practical level and making his life a little easier. Margaret was always very approachable and helpful and we are indebted to her for all her help.  \r\nWe also had great help and input from Danielle, the social worker who gave great advice and arranged for carers to come in from the Trust Domicilliary Care Team and also arranged for social workers to get in touch with me. Each and every one of the carers who come in have been a great help and support and continue to be so. They are so professional, caring and compassionate in how they interact with my husband and their support is a great help to me, as I am the main carer for my husband. Danielle also recommended that I join in via zoom with a Stroke support group, I found this great as it was very informative and helped me to be able to speak to other people who were in the same situation as we were.  \r\nDr McCaffrey has been very attentive in following up on my husband’s progress and has contacted us a few times to check how he is doing, we have really appreciated her ongoing care and advice.  \r\nIn summary the Community Stroke Team and Trust Domiciliary Care Team have been a great help, they have enabled my husband to make great progress following his stroke and have supported me as his carer. He is making great progress and is slowly gaining back his independence with the help of all these lovely people. Thank you so much to each and every one of them.  \r\n","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-01-22T11:45:07.2033333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-01-25T08:45:26.47","readBy":[{"name":"Southern Health and Social Care Trust","count":15},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2021)","count":1},{"name":"Public Health Agency","count":3},{"name":"Patient and Client Council","count":1},{"name":"Ulster University, Faculty of Life and Health Sciences","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/818708","id":"818708"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/818708/responses","id":"818708"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/818708/healthservices","id":"818708"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/818708/tags","id":"818708"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/st003-social-work-service","id":"st003-social-work-service","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003-community-stroke-team","id":"zt003-community-stroke-team","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/approachable","id":"approachable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/caring","id":"caring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/delighted","id":"delighted"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disability","id":"disability"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/end%20of%20life","id":"end of life"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/group","id":"group"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helped","id":"helped"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helpful","id":"helpful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/indebted","id":"indebted"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mobility","id":"mobility"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professional","id":"professional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/referral","id":"referral"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/signposting","id":"signposting"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stroke","id":"stroke"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wheelchair","id":"wheelchair"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appreciated","id":"appreciated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassionate","id":"compassionate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confidence","id":"confidence"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported","id":"supported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/trust","id":"Trust"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/no%20confidence","id":"no confidence"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/820062","id":"820062"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/820102","id":"820102"}]},{"id":818709,"author":"Jelo92","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Caring and compassionate.","body":"I was admitted to S12 in Doncaster Royal infirmary after being seen in the out if hours GP service for abdominal pain.

I had my previous pregnancies under the care of NHS Ayrshire and Arran. I have to say that the night before my first appointment I didn’t sleep. I had built a really good relationship with my community midwife and worried that I would feel the same support in Glasgow.  \r\nMy first appointment was with my community midwife Julie. The relief I felt after meeting her and knowing that she would be looking after us. My baby was measuring big but my previous babies were quite big so I didn’t worry as I felt safe and trusted that staff that they knew what they were doing. My little girl was born January 2018 and a healthy 10lbs 10oz. Unfortunately I sustained a 3rd degree tear and had to go to theatre. My midwives Sam and Kirsty came to theatre and really put me at ease.  \r\nFast forward to September 2019 and I was pregnant again. I knew something didn’t feel right. I phoned EPAS and unfortunately was met with a midwife who offered little support. I was told on several occasions during the phone call that I shouldn’t be under the care of the PRM and she tried to transfer me to the QEUH. I tried to tell her that my previous care was in the PRM and I hadn’t changed address but I was told that if I was to be seen regarding my concerns then I had to attend the QEUH. I decided to wait it out until my community midwife appointment with Julie again.  \r\nI can’t explain the relief when I saw her and she immediately arranged an early scan. Unfortunately this pregnancy ended in a miscarriage. The midwives in EPAS that day were really caring and helpful and took the time to discuss our options. We were devastated and Julie took the time to check how we were coping.  \r\nThankfully I became pregnant soon after and had Julie look after us again. At every appointment she took the time to listen to my concerns and wipe away my tears as this pregnancy was the most stressful I had experienced. Add a pandemic into the mix too. Unfortunately my husband couldn’t attend any of my appointments but I felt supported whenever I had to attend the PRM.  \r\nI was asked to consider an elective c-section after having a large baby in 2018 and sustaining a tear. I was worried at the prospect of this as I had never experienced it with my previous pregnancies but the doctor really took the time to explain the procedure and allowed time for me to make my final decision. I opted for it in the end and the theatre staff that day were amazing. My little boy was born in September 2020 and they took every opportunity to involve my husband which meant so much to him as he had missed out on all our scans and appointments.  \r\nA special mention to Lorna who was lovely. I was in hospital for a few days after and received help and support from the student midwife to help establish breastfeeding. Once discharged I was cared for again by Julie. I feel really lucky to have had her as she really is amazing at her job. I really just wanted to thank the PRM for helping keep our little family safe.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-01-22T05:14:09.7333333","progress":"Story has a

My appointment was at 9:40am. I was called through for the procedure at 10:30am. I was already anxious about going to the hospital and about having the procedure so being made to sit in a waiting room thinking about nothing but the procedure for 50 minutes with 7 other people in the near vicinity did nothing but worsen my anxiety.  \r\nMy letter/leaflet said not to worry about arriving with a full bladder as this wouldn't be needed and actually wasn't preferable for the procedure yet one of the first things I was asked to do was provide a urine sample.  \r\nTo top it all off the consultant told me (right before conducting the procedure) that it wasn't really necessary and shouldn't have been arranged given my relevant medical history leading up to it but that we'd continue if I wanted to. Considering I’d had a Covid test, isolated for 3 days, taken half a day off work, lost sleep worrying about the procedure and spent the last hour feeling sick waiting for it, I didn’t really feel there was a decision to be made here. What this did mean was that I felt backed into a corner of going through with quite an intrusive procedure that could very well lead to infection when it apparently wasn’t really necessary.  \r\nAll in all a shocking experience and I can only hope now that I get no illness or infections as a result of having a procedure I apparently didn't require.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-01-22T14:12:32.9","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2021-01-25T10:48:10.053","readBy":[{"name":"United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust","count":4}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/818736","id":"818736"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/818736/responses","id":"818736"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/818736/healthservices","id":"818736"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/818736/tags","id":"818736"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rwdda_101","id":"RWDDA_101","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxious","id":"anxious"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bladder","id":"bladder"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/information","id":"information"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unwelcoming","id":"unwelcoming"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/urology","id":"urology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wait%20time","id":"wait time"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%20test","id":"covid test"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/contradictions","id":"contradictions"}]},{"id":818742,"author":"SART","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Support and care at A&E","body":"I attended Forth Valley Royal Accident and Emergency Department following an fall on ice in my back garden in early January.

During the procedure I was caringly reassured at every stage that everything was going well.  \r\nI cannot thank Mr Naqvi and his team enough for the professional care they showed me. NHS Scotland at its best. Thank you Mr Naqvi and the Team.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-01-22T12:59:35.6933333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-01-25T11:19:35.183","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Fife","count":5},{"name":"Fife Health & Social Care Partnership","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/818726","id":"818726"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/818726/responses","id":"818726"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/818726/healthservices","id":"818726"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/818726/tags","id":"818726"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/f704h_301","id":"F704H_301","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxious","id":"anxious"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anaesthetic","id":"Anaesthetic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gastroscopy","id":"gastroscopy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good","id":"good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/in%20good%20hands","id":"in good hands"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurse","id":"nurse"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/procedure","id":"procedure"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professional","id":"professional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgical%20team","id":"surgical team"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confidence","id":"confidence"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/explanations","id":"explanations"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/truly%20grateful","id":"truly grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20ease","id":"at ease"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/warm%20greeting","id":"warm greeting"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/819031","id":"819031"}]},{"id":818758,"author":"equuleushp86","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Saved my life","body":"I was admitted with a bleed from my stoma I was quickly seen by on-call surgeon Dr Smith who decided I need the bleed cauterised in theatre, the operation went extremely smoothly but afterward I became septic and ended up in the intensive care unit, the team came to see me the next day so Dr Smith and Dr Granitsiosis wondered what they had missed but to this day I believe it was just a coincidence.

Up until October 2020 it had been good and I had made a lot of progress under the supervision of my previous doctor. Since then the service has been abysmal, some personal circumstances led my mental health to deteriorate. I had repeatedly tried to contact my new consultant to try and get some help, to no avail. I had one appointment with the new consultant where I felt they were very unhelpful, not listening to current symptoms and adamant I waited until I had talking therapy (at least 6 month waiting list). I feel this is unacceptable, the symptoms I was having placed me off work at the beginning of November and some intervention was needed.  \r\nI then went back to my gp to try and get help from them, they have been fantastic. I have now been out of work for two months and have received no care from northlands. This was after repeated attempts from me to contact, and from my gp. None of which was listened to. I would get called back by under qualified nurses who I felt didn’t know anything about my case and could offer no solution. I have had to chase them for call backs all the time, and in nearly three months have spoke to my consultant once. My GP has repeatedly been in contact with them to get a medication review and an assessment, also ignored.  \r\nLast week they said it had just been put on the system and I would hear back this week, instead I got a letter of discharge. What I really want to know is why it has taken them nearly 3 months to discharge me? I’ve lost income, haven’t worked and in financial difficulty now. I repeatedly tried to complain to the managers at northlands, no one ever called me back, I tried on at least 3 occasions. I’m now in the process of formally complaining to the CCG.  \r\nI am disgusted by the quality, and lack thereof, of care and those involved should be ashamed.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-01-22T15:15:27.5133333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-01-25T11:40:41.687","readBy":[{"name":"Sheffield Health and Social Care NHS Foundation Trust","count":4},{"name":"NHS Sheffield ICB","count":2},{"name":"Healthwatch Sheffield","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/818754","id":"818754"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/818754/responses","id":"818754"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/818754/healthservices","id":"818754"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/818754/tags","id":"818754"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/tahxr","id":"TAHXR","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ignored","id":"ignored"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20listened%20to","id":"not listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gp","id":"GP"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/previous%20care","id":"previous care"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/819907","id":"819907"}]},{"id":818795,"author":"handsetby86","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"A focus for my week","body":"I love it, it gives me a focus for my week, volunteer drives are so helpful  \r\nlook forward to my weekly visit","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-01-22T19:24:07.62","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-01-25T11:42:13.07","readBy":[{"name":"Oakhaven Hospice","count":4}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/818795","id":"818795"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/818795/responses","id":"818795"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/818795/healthservices","id":"818795"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/818795/tags","id":"818795"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/8cr40","id":"8CR40","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helpful","id":"helpful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/focus","id":"focus"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/819341","id":"819341"}]},{"id":818793,"author":"indigoxm74","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Outpatient services","body":"I have attended Oakhaven as an outpatient since June 2017.

The labour was a little dramatic as my waters broke at home and were full of meconium so I had to be induced as soon as possible. My midwife, Arlene, was fantastic and allowed me complete control over my whole labour. She kept me informed the whole time and my husband was with me from word go.  \r\nUnfortunately this experience was a far cry from my first labour in 2019 which was awful. Again I had to be induced as baby was 11 days over term. I was induced by pessary and was promptly ignored for the rest of the day. I asked for pain relief several times and was eventually given gas and air. I was told numerous times I was not in labour even though I was getting regular strong contractions every 3-5minutes. I also asked to be examined and was again told no due to the risk of infection. Unfortunately my baby ended up being born in an examination room on the antenatal ward, and I feel this was the fault of the staff involved. I then had to wheeled back through a packed antenatal ward after the birth of my son. I suffered severe anxiety postnatally which I linked to the traumatic labour.  \r\nSo thankfully i did have a far better experience second time round and it was a very healing process for me.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-01-22T19:07:20.6533333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-01-25T12:53:55.807","readBy":[{"name":"Southern Health and Social Care Trust","count":10},{"name":"Public Health Agency","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/818787","id":"818787"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/818787/responses","id":"818787"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/818787/healthservices","id":"818787"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/818787/tags","id":"818787"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_33020_501","id":"ZT003_33020_501","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ignored","id":"ignored"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/traumatic","id":"traumatic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/antenatal","id":"antenatal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/birth","id":"birth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/contractions","id":"contractions"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disorganised","id":"disorganised"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/errors","id":"errors"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gas%20and%20air","id":"gas and air"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/improvement","id":"improvement"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/in%20control","id":"in control"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/induction","id":"induction"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/infection","id":"infection"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kept%20informed","id":"kept informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/labour","id":"labour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/maternity","id":"maternity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/me","id":"ME"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/midwife","id":"midwife"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain%20relief","id":"pain relief"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pessary","id":"pessary"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/previous%20experience","id":"previous experience"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attitude","id":"staff attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/traumatic%20labour","id":"Traumatic Labour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fantastic","id":"fantastic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/relieved","id":"relieved"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/819169","id":"819169"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/819210","id":"819210"}]},{"id":818789,"author":"doradodc84","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Thank you all so much","body":"Everyone involved in my care from volunteer driver through care assistants to the kitchen staff who prepare us a lovely lunch.  \r\nThank you all so much.  \r\nThe warmth and care everyone shows is like a big cuddle.

Staff were very organised from the beginning we were immediately shown to her bed space and given paperwork to fill  \r\nOut and within half an hour of being on the ward my daughter was admitted in and we had spoken with the anaesthetist and dr driver. It was good to be able to speak with the anaesthetist as I was able to tell him that my daughter was quite scared of needles after previous investigations requiring a cannula, he ensured they would do the cannula once my daughter was asleep and this was a huge weight off my mind. Staff were all very nice and were excellent with infection control, always cleaning everything, washing their hands and donning and doffing Ppe which was very reassuring to see. My daughter felt so at home that she practically skipped down to theatre with her welly boots on, haha. The student nurse who took us down was fantastic with her and checked I knew how to get back onto the ward. I don’t remember her name I just know she was close to being qualified. As soon as mr driver was finished in theatre he came up and told me his findings and his thoughts which was also very helpful. My daughter was a bit grumpy after anaesthetic mainly because a catheter had to remain in for her scan later on in the day. all the staff down in recovery and back up on the ward were so patient with her. Staff were always making sure she had food or drinks if she needed them, in particular the student nurse from earlier was very attentive and even asked me if I needed anything which was so kind. The nurses tried to get my daughters scan moved forward to save the catheter being in so long but were unable to, we totally understood this and we were grateful for them to try. Play staff made sure my daughter had plenty to keep her occupied with in her bed space anyways. The staff in radiology again were so lovely and my daughter was happy and smiling during her scan which made it far more easier. One of the nurses had arranged for my daughter to get a small toy because of her long day and she was absolutely delighted, hasn’t stopped going on about her twilight sparkle. Every single member of staff went above and beyond for all the children despite being so busy and with the challenges of the pandemic, they all deserve a Medal. My daughter has to come back shortly for another procedure and she isn’t in the slightest bit scared to go and that’s down to these fantastic staff. I also have no doubts that the lovely student nurse who was dealing with us will make a fantastic qualified nurse. Is there any way I can send in something for the staff? I know with current guidelines this might be difficult. Even if I may make a donation and some sweets or something be bought for staff on the ward as I would really like to give back to the lovely staff.

The sister there is a credit to the NHS, caring, compassionate, funny and a great leader, and Carlos, the man who makes you happy just by looking at him, he would always stop to make sure I was okay,listened to my concerns and never judged me. A lovely man.  \r\nI can’t say thanks enough to all the wonderful NHS workers in the Elective Centre at Croydon Hospital, and I wish I could name you all, you are heroes, you are stepping up to help where others would run, you care about others when there is so many self-centred people about, they say that not all true heroes wear capes, and this certainly proves it to me. Stay safe you wonderful people of the NHS.  \r\nOn a general note to everyone who works in Croydon University Hospital and the whole of the NHS. We as a country will never be able to repay you for your selfless acts you are doing everyday, from the admin staff book appointments, the receptionist who are the face of the NHS, the porters who are the backbone of the NHS, the doctors who are facing the pandemic head on, never budging never wavering, saving lives. And the nurses, who are being pushed to the limit, dealing with horrors only a few can relate too, holding the hands of of patients in their last moments of their lives, being the ones who bear the brunt of everyone’s frustration, you are heroes, you are amazing, you give hope, you are angels, you are all loved.

A fair question in the circumstances, no?  \r\nI was told by the woman at First Response that I was -being manipulative.  \r\nThis is completely unacceptable for a trained MH practitioner to say this. Her bedside manner and compassion was not fit for the post.  \r\nEvery time she called First Response in the height of a suicidal crisis she was either told to go to A&E, call 111 or just asked whether I was home to look after her. Every time, First Response and BDCT devolved their responsibilty and even one time told me, her husband with no MH qualifications and a full time job that her care was my responsibilty. They even once called me whilst I was at work to ask me to go home and look after her. I did, obviously, but if they felt she was at such risk, is it not the job of MH practitioners to provide appropriate care and support, including fast-track treatment?  \r\nThese people in my experience were heartless, compassionless, unprofessional, jaded, disinterested and, I believe, more bothered about inpatient bed-pressures than actually helping people who want to end their own lives.  \r\nSuffice to say, my wife came away from every call to them feeling even worse than before she had called.  \r\nAdditionally, when she was seen by an alleged pychiatrist, at Lynfield Mount, they told her they were discharging her because, -She didn't look depressed. After one meeting, I believe. What qualified Doctor can say something like this. Maybe if she had turned up covered in her own urine, chain-smoking and looking unkempt they might have helped as presumably they only treat people who -look depressed, whatever that means.  \r\nThe entire service is not fit for purpose in my experience.  \r\nMy wife is now dead as a result of suicide.  \r\nPerhaps if the people who get paid a decent wage to support people with depression and suicidal thoughts (and also have a statutory duty of care) had taken her seriously rather than argue with her and label her as argumentative and uncooperative she may be alive today. She may still have taken her own life, but this lot did nothing to help her and basically treated her as though she was being dramatic and attention-seeking.  \r\nAlso, it's amazing how fast BDCT's Serious Incident Team contacted me after her death.  \r\nIf only BDCT would respond to patients' and family's pleas for help and support with such expedience and efficiency before they die rather than after.  \r\nThe only way First Response can help the local community in my experience is if it was disbanded, and the money put to better use.","criticality":"strongly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-01-18T16:05:11.9933333","progress":"Change planned","dateOfPublication":"2021-01-25T14:23:39.223","readBy":[{"name":"Bradford District Care NHS Foundation Trust","count":1},{"name":"Healthwatch Bradford","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/817413","id":"817413"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/817413/responses","id":"817413"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/817413/healthservices","id":"817413"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/817413/tags","id":"817413"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/tad17_710","id":"TAD17_710","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cannot%20be%20bothered","id":"cannot be bothered"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/crisis","id":"crisis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/death","id":"death"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/depressed","id":"depressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/depression","id":"depression"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/die","id":"die"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/feeling","id":"feeling"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/horrible","id":"horrible"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20taken%20seriously","id":"not taken seriously"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/suicidal","id":"suicidal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/suicide","id":"suicide"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/819343","id":"819343"}]},{"id":818968,"author":"blackbirdbf85","authorRoleId":6,"authorRole":"a staff member","title":"COVID vaccination delay","body":"I consented to receive two doses of a Covid-19 vaccine, 3 weeks apart.

They had rescheduled my initial appointment at short notice and then, it seems, failed to inform me of the new date. This was not a one-off issue. My second appointment was cancelled on the morning it was scheduled to take place and further appointments were disrupted by poor time management and lateness (not mine!).  \r\nI could excuse these administrative issues if the appointments themselves had been adequate. The level of care I received from this service was far from acceptable. The people who carried out my assessments seemed to lack basic knowledge, told me things about my condition and medication which are objectively false, disregarded and downplayed the very symptoms that I was seeking help for (because they were severely affecting my functioning and wellbeing), and continuously twisted what I'd told them when relaying things back to me.  \r\nI felt like they decided early on what my 'problem' was and then tried to shoehorn all of my history and symptoms into that diagnosis. I tried to push back on their framing (which was difficult as I felt vulnerable and not listened to) and explain that I did not think that their diagnosis accounted for the symptoms I was seeking help for but my attempts were unsuccessful. I accept that patients do not always know best; however, their preferred diagnosis was not only a bad fit for my symptoms but didn't lead to any sort of further treatment that would address them. Further, they told me that it wasn't really necessary to undergo a formal diagnostic assessment as 'if you do have it, it's only mild'. The symptoms I was seeking help for were not mild-- that's why I was seeking help!  \r\nI left Ballenden House feeling exponentially worse than when I arrived with no diagnosis or signposting to treatment, and no indication of what I should do next.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-01-23T03:21:13.19","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-01-25T15:35:18.573","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lothian","count":6},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2021)","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/818918","id":"818918"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/818918/responses","id":"818918"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/818918/healthservices","id":"818918"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/818918/tags","id":"818918"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/s243h","id":"S243H","score":1},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20listened%20to","id":"not listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/traumatic","id":"traumatic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diagnosis","id":"diagnosis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disregarded","id":"disregarded"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/819786","id":"819786"}]},{"id":818921,"author":"GRIFFCL17","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Excellent NHS 24 service","body":"I had called my GP on Thursday and received excellent care from.the Nurse Practitioner who prescribed antibiotics for a UTI.

Ian was very thoughrough in going through symptoms, what had changed, what was worse etc. He then passed the call on to the nurse on shift - Audrey - who again went through everything, and said a clinician would give me a call within a 2 hour window and they would decide if I had to be seen. Both Audrey and Ian were very efficient, quick and friendly.  \r\nWithin 15 minutes of finishing the call to NHS 24, a clinician based at Stobhill called me back to discuss. The Dr again went through everything and agreed antibiotics needed to be changed and for a longer course.

However when a friend was assaulted and left with life changing injuries, I didn’t know how to deal with it. This left me with many feelings of anger and guilt and I couldn’t comprehend why it was happening to someone who was so good and kind! The feelings that I felt simmered away inside me and this started to cause issues for me at work. All of this alongside the lockdown for Coronavirus impacted my mental health to the point where I could see no way out. When it got to the point where I couldn’t attend work I knew I had to do something. I looked for counselling and found Inclusion Thurrock and I started my counselling within a couple of weeks and it is the best thing I have ever done. Counselling was always something that I never thought I would do. It is my worst nightmare as I never open up to people but this was different. I was at the point where I was ready to change things and the support and guidance I received from my counsellor was impeccable. I started off well and then had a set back but with the help of my counsellor I was back to myself within 3mths. I am building up my resilience now with some extra online support but I feel like a new person and am so thankful that I took this step!","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-01-23T12:38:44.9866667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-01-25T15:59:01.74","readBy":[{"name":"Midlands Partnership NHS Foundation Trust","count":5}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/818929","id":"818929"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/818929/responses","id":"818929"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/818929/healthservices","id":"818929"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/818929/tags","id":"818929"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rrex4-inclusion-thurrock","id":"rrex4-inclusion-thurrock","score":null},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/819702","id":"819702"}]},{"id":818930,"author":"Alison73","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Overall, an excellent experience!","body":"I was an inpatient in ward 23B for 4 weeks following removal of a spinal cord tumour.

Unfortunately not the end of story. At 9am on Sunday I received a call from Wishaw general to inform me that they would try to fit me in for surgery that day if possible. Another call at dinner time to apologise for being rushed off their feet. I was kept informed on Monday both am and pm. The very nice girl on pm call said I was pencilled in for 7. 30am on Wednesday and would get another call on Tuesday at dinner time to confirm. This call was received was received at 5. 20 with all relevant information and another at 7. 25 ish with even more details about emergencies coming in at last minute and such like. This call was from one of the nurses that I met on Wednesday. All went exactly to plan and and every single one of the staff were absolutely brilliant.
