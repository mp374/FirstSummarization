This got me into depression and anxiety. I contacted my GP and he referred to Croydon IAPT.\n\nI found the therapy was very useful and healing. The therapist I had was very competent and understanding. It was encouraging to work with him. I meant to have sessions every other week, but persuaded my therapist to have every week( My anxiety was probably be the reason). My therapist kindly agreed. Half way through the programme, I felt better and start looking for jobs, didn’t get the time to do the exercise given in the course. However, the therapist gave me the push I needed to complete the exercise. My therapist was very patient with me and explained to me the importance of completing it. I realised that it was well worth spending time on it.\n\nAt the start of the therapy, I had a severe level of anxiety and severe level of low mood. After completing the course of therapy; my worries are non existent, I gained positive energy, feel motivated and my anxiety level is mild. \n\nI’d highly recommend the tools and techniques taught in this service to those struggling to manage their worries. It is extremely useful and effective.\n\nThank you my therapist.

Having had experiences of several GP practices across Yorkshire in the past 15 years, I have to say that Springfield is second to none. The receptionists are helpful and efficient and are always keen to do their all to ensure patients get the help they need. The nurses are kind and supportive. Their gentle manner makes their patients feel safe and listened to. The GPs are incredibly dedicated. \n\nI am deeply grateful for the support of my GP at Springfield over the past few years. After the birth of my daughter in 2016, I experienced the most difficult period in my life. One of the most fundamentally helpful things I experienced at Springfield was the continuity of care. Whenever I rang up to make an appointment, I was able to request to see the same GP. If she was planning to be off work, she would recommend another GP who knew about my history. I felt incredibly supported and I always knew I could reach out for help if I needed it.\n\nI will forever be indebted to my GP for the way that she fought for me relentlessly during the darkest moments of my life. She always went above and beyond. I have had several referrals into secondary care over the past few years. My GP would always chase up these referrals and would advocate for me. She was my voice when I was voiceless. Often her determination was the only reason that I was able to access the treatment I needed against all the odds. \n\nAs a result of all of the care and support at Springfield surgery, I am doing really well. I am the most well I have been in a very long time. I am finally able to move forwards with the areas of my life that have been on hold. None of this would have been possible without my GP. \n\nTo all the staff at Springfield Surgery - thank you from the bottom of my heart. Thank you for being so dedicated to your patients. Thank you for treating them with kindness. Thank you for all you do.

They always sound like they want to get rid of me as soon as possible, and often belittle/minimise my condition.\n\nWhile one of the GPs is at least sympathetic, the other comes across as arrogant and patronising - they leave me feeling like I am a child who doesn't know anything about my own symptoms or long-term conditions.\n\nI always leave feeling frustrated and humiliated. Would not recommend at all.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-11-25T09:42:31","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-11-25T10:46:21","readBy":[{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2021)","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/805963","id":"805963"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/805963/responses","id":"805963"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/805963/healthservices","id":"805963"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/805963/tags","id":"805963"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/y02260","id":"Y02260","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/angry","id":"angry"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frustrated","id":"frustrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20frustrated","id":"very frustrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/face","id":"face"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/humiliated","id":"humiliated"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/817951","id":"817951"}]},{"id":805962,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"No reply","body":"I haven't been able to contact this place since the pandemic.

I was lucky in many ways that I had excellent support from an NHS counsellor, who took steps to secure support from the crisis team (who were also amazing) as they spotted that I was becoming very unwell. Although things worsened, I was enormously grateful for the reassurance and support that the crisis team provided. I ended up spending a few weeks in hospital and was discharged back to the crisis team and then my local Community Mental Health Team. Then the pandemic hit.  \r\nI expected there to be an impact, but as mental health was being more widely discussed in the media and workplace, I felt increasingly invisible. I know full well that I am not the only person who needs support, that others are struggling around me and services have had to adapt to cope. But this NHS that I passionately defend is failing me. Instead of getting better, I feel at breaking point again with nowhere to turn.My current support consists of periodic phone appointments with a lovely Dr, where my medications are reviewed and a brief attempt is made at reassuring me that really I am on a waiting list for some therapeutic support, but without an indication of how long this will be. There have been various errors made with medications, promises of support made that haven’t happened and the chasing I have had to do to make anything happen at all, at a time when I feel at my most vulnerable. The cold reality of the situation is best summed up by my conversation with a senior staff member at the CMHT team who told me that of course I was important to them, but they were busy dealing with other priorities such as actively suicidal people. And then went off to deal with something else. The message seems to be that to get any support, you really do need to be actively trying to end your life.For nearly a year now I have fought the urge to do just that, and I can’t tell you how much it saddens me that a professional responsible for my care did not understand the significant impact their words would have on someone who went into hospital rather than take that option.I know there is no magic wand with mental health, but I have asked for help because I need it. I really do. I just want some help.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-11-22T00:58:28.4","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-11-25T10:57:02.793","readBy":[{"name":"Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust","count":25},{"name":"Kings medical students, 2020","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/805223","id":"805223"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/805223/responses","id":"805223"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/805223/healthservices","id":"805223"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/805223/tags","id":"805223"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rha-amh-county-ged","id":"rha-amh-county-ged","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/broken%20promises","id":"broken promises"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/depression","id":"depression"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctor","id":"doctor"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/information","id":"information"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/invisible","id":"Invisible"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/service%20availability","id":"service availability"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vulnerable","id":"vulnerable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid-19","id":"covid-19"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/805977","id":"805977"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/805985","id":"805985"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/806005","id":"806005"}]},{"id":805972,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Great practice ","body":"Excellent service.

My husband couldn’t be with me at scans or triage so it made a huge difference to be in the care of people who were so professional and kind. When I was admitted for induction one midwife in particular (who I’m sadly not allowed to name here) went above and beyond to make sure I was comfortable and fully informed. She stayed with me even when she didn’t have to and as a result of her care I could not have felt in safer hands. \nWhat really overshadowed things was the post natal care. In particular, on the delivery ward one matron was very brusque and sent a cleaner in to prepare my room for the next person when I had literally just finished being stitched up. It was quite a traumatic birth and to have a stranger in the room mopping the floor round your bed while you hold your baby for the first time felt really intrusive. I was hurried down to the post natal ward where there was no bed for me and without my husband there, I remember just breaking down in tears and feeling very alone. The staff there were nice enough but clearly very over stretched and it took forever for them to answer peoples call buttons or to discharge me. So overall, it wasn’t perfect but no hospital is and the many good points far outweigh the few bad. I wouldn’t hesitate to go there again if I’m brave enough to go for baby 3!

I was denied an epidural in maternity assessment when I arrived. My intention is not to blame anyone. I just need some sort of closure and want to make sure that no other women go through the same experience than I did.  \r\nI am French but have been working and living in Glasgow for the past two years. Below is a timeline of the events that happened during my labour, on at Glasgow Queen Elizabeth Hospital. It was during the first coronavirus peak; partners were only allowed in the labour ward.  \r\nMy contractions started late evening. I was at home with my partner. My partner phoned the hospital to let them know that labour had started.We phoned again in the early hours of the following morning to give an update. I was advised to stay at home. We phoned as the contractions were becoming more intense at this point I expressed my wish to be assessed. A few hours later I was admitted to the Maternity Assessment ward on my own as partners were not allowed. As I was only 2/3 cm dilated, I was sent back home to allow labour to establish further.  \r\nLater that morning I phoned to give an update on how I was doing since attending the hospital. Late afternoon that day I phoned again as contractions were becoming more intense and lasted longer. I was asked if I wanted to attend. I said yes. I again attended the maternity assessment ward on my own for the second time. I was welcomed by a midwife who took care of me during all my stay in the assessment ward. The contractions were strong. My dilation was at 4/5 cm. The midwife told me that they would get me to the labour ward. Unfortunately, all the beds were taken, so I had to wait on my own in the assessment ward for 2 hours.  \r\nAs soon as I arrived, I told the midwife that I wanted an epidural. They replied that I was coping really well, had managed to stay at home for a long time, so that might not be necessary. They mentioned morphine and also asked me if I had considered water birth; to which I answered no. They came back a few minutes later to tell me that actually all the pools were closed because of coronavirus. Did not mention epidural or morphine anymore and just gave me dihydrocodeine and took my blood.  \r\nI felt that the intensity of the contractions had increased dramatically. The midwife phoned the labour ward to see if there was any free bed. I was admitted to the labour ward and finally reunited with my partner. During the handover between the two midwives, I could hear them talking, the information passed on was that I might want an epidural but was coping well so would probably not need it. It was shift change and a new midwife took over my care. During the handover, my partner and I again overheard them discussing that I might want an epidural. We both reacted at the same time and stated quite vehemently that I did want an epidural. The midwife took my request into account, but we now had to wait for my blood results to come back. As stated above, my blood had only just been taken while I had been on the maternity assessment center. By the time, the results arrived, the anesthetist was taken on an emergency. We therefore had to wait for the epidural siting.  \r\nThe anesthetist arrived to discuss epidural, afterwards the epidural procedure commenced. The epidural was sited by the anesthetist, but a very short time later my baby was born. The epidural did not work. I went through the labour with forceps, episiotomy and second degree- tears only using other pain relief (which did not even work at the end as I had to remove the mask to answer the anesthetist’s questions). I ended up with a massive scar.  \r\nThe night shift labour ward midwife was brilliant and did the best they could with the situation that was inherited. The gynecologist who delivered the baby, also did an amazing job.  \r\nI do not understand however how, the first midwife who took care of me, could decide on their own, that I was coping well and might not need an epidural while I had clearly stated that I wanted one from the start. I am a self-contained person and I have never expressed pain in a dramatic way.  \r\nShould I deduce that in the 21st century Scotland, the only way to have an epidural is to scream and cry to show your pain? Are self-contained persons excluded from stronger pain relief because they seem to cope too well?Does this mean that the NHS consider that staff opinion is more valuable than the patient's wishes or does this depend on the person on shift when you arrive? The second thing that I do not understand is why I had to wait for two hours to have my blood taken. We lost precious minutes waiting for blood results to have the epidural sited. Having them earlier might have change the course of events.  \r\nI do not feel any sort of pride having been able to go through a forceps, episiotomy and second-degree labour only using gas & air. I just feel traumatised and extremely disappointed. I had never felt so vulnerable in my whole life. Instead of being listened to by the persons who were supposed to take care of me, they decided for me. Because of this experience, I am not sure I want more children.  \r\nOnce I stopped having nightmares about my labour, I began to do a bit of research. I was astonished to discover that a scandal of epidural denial in the UK had been highlighted in a newspaper back in January 2020. The official inquiry that followed concluded that women in labour were not receiving epidural when they asked for it and that this was in breach of official guidelines. I was able to find several articles in the mainstream news which covered this topic.  \r\n  \r\nI keep wondering:  \r\n• How could I live this kind of situation, 3 months after the issue was highlighted and only a month after the findings of the official investigations were released?  \r\n• Which process is in place to ensure that pain relief options are discussed with women and received when they ask for it?  \r\nWe have been living in Scotland for 2 years and have enjoyed every part of it. I am extremely proud that my baby was born here. It is just a shame that our only bad experience here is the one that was supposed to be the most beautiful.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-11-22T15:26:49.32","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-11-25T12:03:41.873","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":6},{"name":"Scottish Government","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/805276","id":"805276"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/805276/responses","id":"805276"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/805276/healthservices","id":"805276"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/805276/tags","id":"805276"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sj9qe-labsuitematernity","id":"sj9qe-labsuitematernity","score":1},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sj9qe-matassesmenttriage","id":"sj9qe-matassesmenttriage","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disappointed","id":"disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20listened%20to","id":"not listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20listening","id":"not listening"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bed%20availability","id":"bed availability"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/childbirth","id":"childbirth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/epidural","id":"epidural"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/episiotomy","id":"episiotomy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gynaecologist","id":"gynaecologist"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/labour","id":"labour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain%20relief","id":"pain relief"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/patient%20choice","id":"patient choice"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scar","id":"scar"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/traumatised","id":"traumatised"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting","id":"waiting"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/restrictions","id":"restrictions"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/involved%20in%20decisions","id":"involved in decisions"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/night%20shift","id":"night shift"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/806259","id":"806259"}]},{"id":805996,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Fantastic helpful caring and dedicated.","body":"The wife and I have been patients of Old Station since it opened and before that White Lion, for over 33 years.\nWe both have a lot of health issues and without this practice our lives could be as bad as unbearable, yet with all the help and care we receive we feel we have a lot to look forward to.\n\nIt's when you need them the most that you just realise how fantastic these guys are, but also on our yearly check ups we actually look forward to because we know if anything further needs looking at they find it.\n\nWe stay in this area because of the needs we have and honestly we believe we wouldn't be looked after like we are at Old Station, I hate to say Old Station because it's not the building but the wonderful caring people that work there.\nWe almost know everyone by now and every single person does a wonderful job which makes and incredible team.\n\nI do get lost for words just how much appreciation we have for this team because every single time we have needed help we have been cared for so well.

However since becoming quite seriously unwell i have had to rely on hospital specialists who have been excellent and restored my faith. Thanks to cardiology, infection diseases physicians and the OPAT services; truly excellent care. Recently I have spent a lot of time in various different hospitals and have had the time to compare them with each other, and I actually was feeling very lucky that Forth Valley was my local hospital.  \r\nLast week I was admitted to Forth Valley again but I had never been in a surgical ward with a complaint about abdominal pain before. Overall the medical and nursing staff were excellent, especially considering the whole Covid19 situation, all the new measures added to a hospital keyworkers already busy day. I was treated with respect and care. I had various procedures that were new for me and the majority were well explained.However there was one procedure where the information was severely lacking with the result of complete humiliation and distress for me. I feel embarrassed to be sharing this story but, it is an experience that could easily have been made more compassionate and less traumatic for me. I had to have an enema which I have never experienced before nor had any knowledge about. Prior to and during the procedure, which was actually fine and not as bad one might imagine, I asked questions about it to the nurse. The procedure itself was explained very well at the time but they omitted to explain what would happen after it was administered. This omission led to me going through unexpected pain and then the humiliating experience of soiling myself and my clothing on several occasions until I had no clean clothing of my own. I then sat very upset in soiled clothes because I had no other option. Some time later an auxiliary nurse saw my distress, pulled the curtain for privacy and compassionately explained that it was very common occurrence. They immediately brought me fresh hospital clothes, incontinence pads and prepared my bed in anticipation for 'an accident'. I immediately felt better and less degraded, although I was still very emotional about it all. Now I just feel stupid that I didn't realise how the enema would work. Please🙏 🙏🙏🙏 could you fully prepare your patient for consequences of any procedure/treatment that you do where there may be unexpected symptoms. Not all patients may want to know but in this case it would have been far less traumatic and degrading for me. I was in a shared room with 3 other patients so the humiliation was even worse, me a 50+ year old lady quiet and anxious, sitting in soiled clothes and probably smelling a bit.I was very, very upset and writing this I am actually crying again so this needs to be taken seriously and addressed. I would not wish someone else to feel this way. It is an easy thing to rectify, staff administering an enema just need to explain all the things that can commonly happen afterwards. The auxiliary nurse and night staff nurse both agreed my symptoms were common and normal and helped with my pain and my upset. I have not made this post to get any one single staff member into trouble but just to have this highlighted and cascaded to staff members carrying out the same procedure. Let us be informed and thus dignified.

I've got stuff to do today, im active in my recovery and that's a true blessing that i take seriously because over 10 mths ago it wasn't like this. i was in my last and worst relapse i need whoever to believe me and feel what I'm saying - using and knowing there is a solution to me not using is a horrible place to be in my last relapse was a time where self sabotage was at it's most powerful for me. A close friend of mine said to me he was expecting a phone call that I had passed away through my using. In the end I was taking multiple substances and taking risks like the world was about to end, like I said knowing that there is help. People who care for me was saying it's getting too much to watch but would still try and help support me.By the grace of God i took help from many of my true friends and i ended up on a detox plan in Stockport with a plan to go in another treatment house in Bacup. When I got to Glen valley I'd used that morning and the manager picked up on this and asked me to come back the next day. I was so desperate and with no other choice did this. While there I met the detox nurse Kelly and the love care and support I was given by Kelly, the staff and my peers at Glen valley was absolutely what i needed even though I've used for many years this was my first physical detox. I struggled and on many of occasions my dark thoughts of I can't do this nearly had me out of the door. Kelly i hope you know and feel what you do for people changes lives. I'm sat here today nearly 9mths clean and sober again. I'd like to offer any support i can to any newcomers who need support or someone to listen or talk to. I'm not guna say my detox was easy and i'm not guna say recovery is easy, but what i will say, it's so much better than using. My soul and heart was dying. Today right here right now in this moment I'm alive with a purpose and a smile. I think ya know what life ain't that bad for me that's a true God given miracle and through hard work and love and support from others its available to everyone that needs and wants it. GOD BLESS.  \r\nKelly you're an absolute Angel, seriously from my heart thank you and I'm sure my mum where she is is also thanking you.

I have experienced weekly school complaints regarding his behaviour, but with more emphasis on how this affects 'other children'. Until now my child has only ever received complaints but no support, which as a parent is incredibly disappointing.  \r\nI was so thrilled to hear about CAMHS and their Services / Mission in working with 'all children, adolescents and families referred to them to have access to the most appropriate form of psychological help'. However, I am finding that even when a child is clearly recognised as having an issues, through school and referred by the Doctor the waiting time for acknowledgement from CAMHS is on average 18 months. My issue is that 18 months for a child who is struggling and being ostracised by peers is a long wait! My Doctor has now made 2 calls to the CAMHS team to find out how my son's appointment is coming on and has been told that he has another minmum 6 months before being seen. To put this in perspective, my Son will be nearly at the end of his Schooling before he is offered help from the CAMHS team. The stress and anxiety of not being able to focus at the most crucial time in his education is extremely disheartening, and does not align with the mission nor the service being advertised by CAMHS. My GP actually feels so much empathy and has repeated told me that their hands are tied as this is the CAMHS team area of expertise.  \r\nHow do I feel? Disappointed, let down, saddened by the hope that I felt in my son would receive the help he needs to constantly being de-prioritsed and overlooked by a service that is failing to provide the specialist support that is required.  \r\nHow does my son feel - abandoned, pushed aside, helpless and that no-one cares.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-11-23T19:07:38.8366667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-11-25T14:27:25.387","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lanarkshire","count":9},{"name":"North Lanarkshire Health & Social Care Partnership","count":5},{"name":"Voluntary Action North Lanarkshire","count":1},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":1},{"name":"Partnership for Change","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/805418","id":"805418"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/805418/responses","id":"805418"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/805418/healthservices","id":"805418"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/805418/tags","id":"805418"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sl9-camhs","id":"SL9-camhs","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/abandoned","id":"abandoned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/angry","id":"angry"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helpless","id":"helpless"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stress","id":"stress"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/adhd","id":"adhd"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/camhs","id":"camhs"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/education","id":"education"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/empathy","id":"empathy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gp","id":"GP"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/long%20waiting%20list","id":"long waiting list"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/priority","id":"priority"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/saddened","id":"Saddened"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/service%20availability","id":"service availability"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20disappointed","id":"very disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/no%20hope","id":"no hope"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/806025","id":"806025"}]},{"id":804940,"author":"Bpdgirl","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Wouldn't recommend not good experiences so far","body":"I dont even know where to start, I have been fobbed off one too many times where they just send me to different services.  \r\nDoesnt seem that half of them are on the same page, I hit a really low point and a cpn discharged me even tho I wasnt ready, a week later I was struggling so much I tried to phone crisis team - got told they couldn't deal with me as my case was closed. I then tried to phone gp, and they couldn't see me that day and to call the following morning. That night I overdosed with no where to turn to. I was lost.  \r\nThis wasnt the 1st and it wont b the last I am sure, I was referred back to them and was finally given a decent cpn who listened to me and referred me for psychology. I was on a waiting list for months and they continued to keep in touch as I was defo not over the worst.  \r\nI then finally got a psychologist and have had about 8 appointments but after the 3rd appt, I felt there was no point going into my childhood drama as the psychologist was only going to be able to have a few sessions left.  \r\nNow the psychological team want me to speak to We Are With You which I said I am happy to do, but wish to be placed back into the waiting list for another psychologist as I still have no clue how to handle my emotions ( I have bpd)  \r\nIt feels like the team basically dont want me on the waiting list just fobbing me onto another service that can only deal with part of the problem, whereas I know myself I need both help at the same time to overcome the worst...

I had a number of concerns with my daughter including reflux and ear infections. Dr Coia in particular was so personable and has really put my mind at ease. She saw my daughter on the same day that I phoned and honestly just made me feel so much better about everything. I just feel that in the middle of a global pandemic, this practice deserves recognition. I also want to highlight how amazing the health visitor has been.
