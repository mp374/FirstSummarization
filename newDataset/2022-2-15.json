I didn't really want to be referred, as I was scared that I would have to have a telephone appointment instead of a face-to-face appointment. My worst fears came true when I was told I would have to have a telephone, as the doctors were not doing face-to-face appointments. I reluctantly accepted the telephone appointment, as I felt I had no choice in the matter. Looking back now, I wish I hadn't agreed to have a telephone appointment as it was absolutely awful. The appointment was rushed and it felt more like an interrogation than an outpatient clinic appointment. Even the doctor said I should have been able to have a face-to-face appointment, as they could tell I was struggling and anxious during the telephone appointment. The doctor told me they would have been happy to see me face-to-face, but management wouldn't allow it to happen.\n\nThe appointment only lasted just over 15 minutes which isn't long enough for a first appointment, especially when it had to take place over the telephone where communication between the patient and doctor is much harder. I am now worried that there may have been some miscommunication between myself and the doctor, as I was getting a bit confused at times trying to explain everything over the telephone. \n\nAs you can gather I really don't like telephone appointments. This was my very first ever appointment under the care of a doctor at Barts Hospital and it didn't give me a very good first impression of the hospital. I am supposed to be getting another appointment for 6 months' time and I really hope and pray it will be a face-to-face appointment, as the thought of having to have another telephone appointment feels me with dreed.\n\n","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-02-14T18:52:03","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2022-02-15T08:43:58","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/916745","id":"916745"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/916745/responses","id":"916745"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/916745/healthservices","id":"916745"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/916745/tags","id":"916745"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/r1hm0","id":"R1HM0","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxious","id":"anxious"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confused","id":"confused"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scared","id":"scared"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/worried","id":"worried"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/face","id":"face"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good","id":"good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/interrogation","id":"interrogation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20good","id":"not good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20scared","id":"not scared"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/rushed","id":"rushed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happy","id":"happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hope","id":"Hope"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20worried","id":"not worried"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/no%20hope","id":"no hope"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20happy","id":"not happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20happy","id":"very happy"}]},{"id":916750,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"very disappointing","body":"Very disappointing!

We rang NHS 111 who had a 30min hold time, so I hung up and dialled 999 as he developed facial swelling.  \r\nI was advised earliest an ambulance could reach us was 3 hours but average was 9 hours so could we drive him to a&e. This feels absolutely outrageous for a child under 2 who could have gone on to develop breathing problems to be left for approx 9 hrs. Fortunately we had a car.  \r\nSeen immediately in a&e which was great. Outcome was referral to dietician and allergy clinic.  \r\nDietician review: I was really shocked at the lack of patient-centred care demonstrated during my consultation with paediatric dietician. Poor listening skills, and I felt pretty much “thrown out” of the online appointment.  \r\nTime was wasted telling me things when I had specific questions that remain unanswered. Also no open questions were used and I realised at the end that the dietician was still unaware of the further allergies we have identified since. It ended with “I need to go, I have other patients”. Felt really upset that I had not been listened to and questions remain unanswered.  \r\nAllergy clinic: incident occurred in Sept 2021. Referral to clinic did not happen until Dec 2021. Why did it take so long? This clinic has a long waiting list and this delay adds on nearly three months to an already anxious wait.  \r\nAs an NHS worker myself I 100% understand service pressures. However all of this feels just unacceptable to me. Ambulance wait, poor communication skills and why would it take so long to put in a simple referral for something as serious as peanut allergy in a baby?","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-02-12T08:42:06.6633333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-02-15T10:21:54.12","readBy":[{"name":"Scottish Ambulance Service","count":10},{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":8}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/916247","id":"916247"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/916247/responses","id":"916247"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/916247/healthservices","id":"916247"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/916247/tags","id":"916247"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/g513h_420","id":"G513H_420","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/scot-ambulance-emergency","id":"scot-ambulance-emergency","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sj9-west-glasgow-ambulatory-care-anaphylaxis-ana","id":"SJ9-west-glasgow-ambulatory-care-Anaphylaxis-ana","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxious","id":"anxious"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20being%20listened%20to","id":"not being listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scared","id":"scared"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/a&e","id":"a&e"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/allergy","id":"allergy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/delay","id":"delay"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dietician","id":"Dietician"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/facial%20swelling","id":"facial swelling"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/long%20wait","id":"long wait"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/paediatric","id":"paediatric"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/referral","id":"referral"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ambulance%20wait","id":"ambulance wait"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/person%20centred%20care","id":"Person centred care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/peanut%20allergy","id":"peanut allergy"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/916772","id":"916772"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/916850","id":"916850"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/917838","id":"917838"}]},{"id":916249,"author":"Jaques27Gilles","authorRoleId":4,"authorRole":"a relative","title":"Security staff lacked compassion or politeness","body":"I want to give feedback on my wife’s visit to the Emergency Department at Truro one evening last week.  \r\nThe care and attention of the nursing staff and doctors could not have been better and for that we are very grateful. The same could not be said of the security guards (that’s the only way to describe them), at the ED.  \r\nWe had waited in the waiting area for about an hour when three guards arrived and without any given reason they told everyone who wasn’t a patient to leave. Their attitude was as if they were policing at a nightclub or rock concert, not people who were vulnerable, in an alien environment and some who couldn’t stand, let alone walk without assistance.  \r\nOne elderly lady who couldn’t stand without assistance was shouted at by one of the guards because he could not understand what she was saying.  \r\nTheir attitude was completely without compassion or politeness. When challenged they just said it was because of Covid crowding and the “rules”. Well nothing changed between one minute and the next, so why were we thrown out, because that’s what it felt like. Even later on when my wife was discharged at 22:00 they were still not allowing carers to enter, even through there were only half a dozen people in there.  \r\nI am 72 and my wife is 71. She was left on her own with a twisted knee, head injury, bruised wrist and sore neck in a hospital she didn’t know, without anyone to comfort her.  \r\nThe guards very obviously had no training in caring for elderly and confused patients. I was told to wait outside in a temperature of 4 degrees without proper clothing. We were part of a coach tour and had arrived at the hospital by taxi and so did not have a car to wait in. It was only after two hours that someone waiting with me told me that there was a main reception area a few minutes’ walk away. How much better it would have been to have been told this earlier.  \r\nI will always obey instructions if they are sensible, reasonable and given in a civilised way. These guards were anything but this. Your policy on how patients and carers are approached in the waiting area needs a serious review.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-02-12T10:04:57.7733333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-02-15T10:29:18.683","readBy":[{"name":"Royal Cornwall Hospitals NHS Trust","count":7},{"name":"Healthwatch Cornwall","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/916249","id":"916249"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/916249/responses","id":"916249"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/916249/healthservices","id":"916249"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/916249/tags","id":"916249"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/ref12_180","id":"REF12_180","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bruised","id":"bruised"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/clinical%20staff","id":"Clinical staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/elderly","id":"elderly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/head%20injury","id":"head injury"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/information","id":"information"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/knee","id":"knee"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/neck","id":"neck"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/offended","id":"offended"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/security%20staff","id":"security staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attitude","id":"staff attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting","id":"waiting"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wrist","id":"wrist"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/916771","id":"916771"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/916802","id":"916802"}]},{"id":916255,"author":"Man of Steel","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Informative pre-assessment clinic made me confident","body":"I visited the pre-assessment clinic prior to having a total knee replacement and found it very useful and informative.  \r\nThe staff were professional and answered all my questions with a light touch which put me entirely at ease and I left feeling confident that I was in capable hands.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-02-12T11:24:40.13","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-02-15T10:33:58.107","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Fife","count":8},{"name":"Fife Health & Social Care Partnership","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/916255","id":"916255"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/916255/responses","id":"916255"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/916255/healthservices","id":"916255"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/916255/tags","id":"916255"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/f704h_110","id":"F704H_110","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/information","id":"information"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/knee%20replacement","id":"knee replacement"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pre-op%20assessment","id":"pre-op assessment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professionalism","id":"professionalism"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confident","id":"confident"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20ease","id":"at ease"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/916803","id":"916803"}]},{"id":916257,"author":"Katee95","authorRoleId":8,"authorRole":"a staff member posting for a patient/service user","title":"Care for appendicitis","body":"After being referred by my GP with a suspected bladder infection, due to severe pain I had, I arrived into 4 south then discovered it was appendicitis.  \r\nInitially a scan was arranged to rule out appendicitis, as this didn't take place it delayed my diagnosis.

The following are my observations - of which I have proof - from the Eye Clinic waiting room and reception area. Please note: my dealing with hospital staff in this review was, if surprised, one of civil empirical inquiry.\n3. Numerous* Ashford Hospital Eye Clinic medical staff (uniformed nurses and non-uniformed eye specialists) wearing masks below the nose or below the mouth. In these instances, at times the masks would cover both nose and mouth, then at other times adjusted for periods below the nose, then at other times adjusted for periods below the mouth. An air of unconcerned convenience and common consent was evident among all medical staff - both mask wearing compliant and mask wearing non-compliant. *numerous in this content that even 1 is too many - my observed reference is of at least 4 medical staff and 3 outpatients. \n4. Numerous* outpatients in waiting room casually following Ashford Hospital Eye Clinic medical staff example of improper wearing of mask below the nose or below the mouth.  One outpatient after noticing medical staff example adjusted her mask below the nose, then after further time to below the mouth when not addressed on this issue by medical staff. Said outpatient then settled in wearing the mask round her/they neck like a necklace.\n5. A casual nonchalant attitude of abandon by Ashford Hospital Eye Clinic medical staff when questioned regarding the above improper wearing of masks by numerous Ashford Hospital Eye Clinic medical staff and numerous Eye Clinic outpatients. No answer - merely an indifference avoidance of the issue and adjusting of the mask as it should be properly worn covering both nose and mouth.\n6. Persons at ground reception 'not' wearing a mask and addressing me at one of two large open gaps from counted to ceiling - the smaller 20 inches along counter as measures by my elbow to outstretched fingers.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-02-15T12:06:54","progress":"Unread

I lost a significant amount of blood and was quite poorly following the birth, so didn't get the immediate skin to skin I had hoped for.  \r\nWhile in high dependency, the support I got from the IFSW and midwives was incredible. Knowing my wish was to breastfeed, but unable to get baby to successfully latch, they were gathering my colostrum for me while I couldn't do much to help.  \r\nI had constant support, motivation, positive encouragement from the breastfeeding support worker throughout my stay in hospital. I ended up expressing in hospital and syringe feeding baby, but still working on getting the latch. Kareen made me feel empowered that I had all the knowledge I needed to be discharged and successfully feed my baby. Although I was still having issues getting baby to latch, I was offered so many tips and tricks and hints to try and encourage it.  \r\nHad I not had that support, I am certain that I wouldn't still be breastfeeding almost a year later. The day after I got home, a community IFSW visited me and gave me the reassurance and encouragement I needed. I ended up using nipple shields as we were still struggling with the latch, however after about 3 months, baby refused the shields and wanted to latch herself!

I would constantly be checking doors, lights, taps etc. I didn't think much about it in the beginning because I told myself I was just being careful/responsible.  \r\nIt was only around 6 months ago that I realised things were getting worst. Although I didn't see it at the time even being able to sit and relax started to become difficult. Me being stubborn I still told myself that things will get better when we are out of lockdown and my responsibilities can start to change. I was wrong, it was only until I had somewhat of an emotional realisation that I needed help. Thus, with the help of family and friends, they told me to send put a self-application to Ealing IAPT. I was very surprised at how quick it was for me to be paired with a CBT therapist. My magnificent therapist was Sita. Sita is absolutely fantastic, by the end of the 10th week I was able to go about day to day life without worrying or feeling anxious. I was so surprised to see how quick CBT works especially since I had done all my sessions online over Microsoft Teams. Ultimately Sita has managed to help me regain control of my thoughts and behaviour in no time. On top of all that, speaking to someone who isn't a family member or friend helps so much with mental health. It's great just to be able to get things off your chest and not feel judged.  \r\nI'm glad to say I'm a lot better and happier now.  \r\nA big thank you to Ealing IAPT and especially the Sita for everything. It has been an amazing experience.

On this visit the ultrasound result was discussed and then I taken to another room and was asked to lay on the couch for an examination, a doctor from the team and either 1 or 2 nurses in attendance (I can't remember how many as I was so scared by the situation I was suddenly in). The doctor said \"we need a quick look at the fibroid so we need to insert a camera/scope past your cervix to get a closer look\".  \r\nWhat happened next is still traumatising me. I was on the couch, and they started to try to get the camera/scope in through my cervix. The pain was worse than anything I have ever felt, I was in agony - it felt like they were trying to get an iron bar through.  \r\nThe first attempt failed so they tried again causing even more pain & distress. A third attempt followed and the doctor mentioned I had a very strong cervix which was fighting them and not letting the scope get through in a tone of voice that made it sound like it was my fault. The pain was worse with every attempt and my anxiety was through the roof.  \r\nI begged them to stop as I couldn't take any more pain. They did stop after the third attempt and left me to get dressed... it was only after they had finished that the doctor asked me if I had never had children. I was left to get dressed and then left the hospital and staggered back to my partner waiting in the car.  \r\nI was left traumatised, shaking and felt sick with the pain and I bled for a few days afterwards.  \r\nI now have extreme anxiety and am getting flashbacks. I have to attend a different hospital in a few weeks time for a hysteroscopy, it was only on researching what was likely to be done at my new appointment that I realised that the procedure was almost identical to the one at the first hospital.  \r\nI explained to my new consultant about what had happened to me and how fearful I am. They seemed very good over the phone and I was assured I can have gas & air, pain relief to be taken prior to the procedure and will use the smallest scope and at any time I can't cope they will stop if I ask. I hope the doctor will be as good as their word, on the phone they did not sound too impressed by my earlier experience. My fear & anxiety is off the scale. I have to have this done as they are checking in case it's anything more serious than a large fibroid because of my symptoms so I know it makes sense - I'm just terrified after what happened at the other place, I can't get it out of my mind. The closer to the appointment date is making the anxiety worse each day.  \r\nAm I correct in thinking that the first hospital did indeed spring a hysteroscopy on me? I ask as I had no warning at all which meant no pain relief prior to the appointment, no anaesthetic gel during the procedure and I was left feeling totally violated. At no time was I asked to sign a consent form for this procedure and because no prior warning was given by the hospital I had no pain relief at all and no information was sent out to me. I was led to believe it was just a follow-up appointment to discuss the ultrasound result and possible treatment options.","criticality":"strongly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-02-10T17:34:40.9566667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-02-15T15:21:00.487","readBy":[{"name":"Doncaster and Bassetlaw Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/915726","id":"915726"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/915726/responses","id":"915726"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/915726/healthservices","id":"915726"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/915726/tags","id":"915726"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rp5dr_502","id":"RP5DR_502","score":1},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/terrified","id":"terrified"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/violated","id":"violated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appointment%20letter","id":"appointment letter"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/distress","id":"distress"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hysteroscopy","id":"hysteroscopy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/information","id":"information"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/informed%20consent","id":"informed consent"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain%20management","id":"pain management"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/preparation","id":"preparation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/traumatised","id":"traumatised"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/uninformed","id":"uninformed"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/923084","id":"923084"}]},{"id":916382,"author":"Clare McKenna","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Thank you to everyone","body":"My children attended for penicillin challenges having both been labelled with a penicillin allergy.

Had a massive haemmorage as i entered the building, soaking my clothes and panicking me. A&E was more like a busy visa office in a third world country, with every seat taken, people sitting on the floor, disengaged staff. I was told a nurse would see me shortly. It seemed totally chaotic there with names often being called of people who weren't even there. Three hours later the triage nurse called me in and said she would send me to emergency gynaecology. I went to the toilet and it was absolutely filthy. I waited another hour in my blood-soaked clothes just to have the triage nurse call me back in to say 'sorry but they won't scan you now, there's no more slots. They said to send you home and come back tomorrow.' This is \"emergency\" gynaecology. I guess everyone wanted to go home, although why on earth i wasn't sent there immediately is beyone me. I wasn't even seen by a consultant, just told to leave. I spoke to a GP via 111 because i needed some medical advice and she was shocked that St Marys had sent me home un-seen to. Thank goodness for Queen Charlotte hospital who met me today with calm professionalism, fitting urgency, compassion and getting me properly seen to - after a sleepless night not knowing if i'd lost my baby or not. Inhumane.\nSt Marys has been desperately rude to me on the phone once before, when i was trying to refer myself at the start of my pregnancy. However, i can be grateful for that because it meant i went to Queen Charlotte hospital (on the other end of the Imperial spectrum!) instead. In my experience, St Marys is a hell hole, not a civilised hospital and i would go a bit further to the Royal Free A&E if i ever have a future emergency.

Was told the receptionists could give me the results if I phoned. I did and was told results sent to Consultant and couldn't get any more information. Picked up a referral at the surgery and in it there was an abnormal blood result which no-one warned me about and no communication about it. I now find 14.02.22 that there was an abnormal stool test which was slightly abnormal. That means nothing but I should have been given this information to pass on the a GI Consultant as this may have changed his thinking. The abnormal blood result meant being suspended from the transplant list and no-one appears to be concerned about this. Then I am told 14.02.22 that I am being referred on the NHS yet have heard nothing about making an electronic booking. I don't feel that receptionists should be communicating abnormal blood results when they don't know what they are/mean or can't find them and can't then answer any questions. This is the responsibility of the GP. So please answer why you leave a patient to find out about an abnormal blood result in a referral letter and then don't communicate another abnormal result. Prior to Covid you were very quick to act about abnormal results but I have been very disappointed in the communication of these abnormal results.
