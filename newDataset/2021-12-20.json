They way they manage their patients prescription is absolutely WRONG!!!!.  I put my request in with their recommended method online on a Wednesday around 4pm. Its now Friday i called the surgery to check if i should head to the chemist. They said its with the Gp. I explained I suffer from multiple health issues and need it today. After placing me on hold she returned to say the doctors said it hasnt been two working days and i have to wait How can you leave a patient without medication over the weekend is beyoned me. I thank my lucky stars i dont have any terminally illness if i had i'd be long dead before these Doctors help. \n\nTheir appointment system is even worse. I called to booked my wifes appt which the gp  advise himself by Sms. When i called to book the Reception  gave me an appointment after New Years. i questioned the receptionist why am I waiting this long the Gp is the one who asked to speak to me. She said the doctor put \"its routine\" so can wait. Now my Christmas and new years is full of anxiety not knowing what further health problems she has developed but the GP thinks its ok to tell you 1month is advance theres something wrong but its not important enough so you can suffer in silence until i call you in a month or too.\n\n\nAbsolutely disgusting","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2021-12-17T18:28:07","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-12-20T13:55:16","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/904166","id":"904166"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/904166/responses","id":"904166"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/904166/healthservices","id":"904166"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/904166/tags","id":"904166"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/f84111","id":"F84111","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/head","id":"head"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/important","id":"important"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lucky","id":"lucky"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20lucky","id":"very lucky"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/worse%20than%20before","id":"worse than before"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/944208","id":"944208"}]},{"id":904160,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Heart monitor check","body":"Go sent me to ae.

I was recently told to arrange a blood test for a specific time of day, which I had to wait 2 weeks for, this was subsequently cancelled 3 times and took me over a month to have done. Once it was done I made an appointment with my GP as instructed and I had to wait 4 weeks for that. I spoke with them a few weeks ago and it was decided to take me off some current medication to tie in with my appointment. Last night I got a text message telling me my appointment has been cancelled and to call to make a new one. The first available appointment with her being the 11th of January. Being told by the receptionist that this is down to illness felt like the biggest slap in the face ever imaginable. I fully understand and accept that the current conditions we are all faced with are extremely challenging and I know these kind of situations are unavoidable at times. But to be consistently abandoned and let down when you are already feeling vulnerable and unwell is extremely difficult to cope with. My GP is excellent, the practise however leaves a lot to be desired at the moment.

He went up early (3pm) but was not seen until after 10pm. Although we could complain about the waiting times the issue was the treatment that he had. Long story short. His thumb was reset into place just over half an inch longer than his other thumb. This was reset again and he was placed into a boxer cast. He was told he did not have broken fingers (he did) he was told he needed a splint for his cast (he did not get this as there was none). The nurse said they had never done a cast like the one my husband needed and they cast him wrong.  \r\nHis hand was not put in a neutral position but placed inwards along with a bend in the wrist. We are quite lucky that not only me as his wife being a nurse who has worked with casts previously but we have a number of family and friends who are also nurses quite senior. My husband wanted to trust that a&e that night. He had done the right thing to start his dislocated and broken thumb in its healing process. But the cast was incorrect.  \r\nHe went back two weeks later. The cast was not removed, it was not recast appropriately and he received an xray. He was told his hand was healing great and his fingers were in fact broken. Lucky for him I had been splinting his fingers myself at home. I also showed him how to re-splint his fingers himself when I was not there to clean and change it.  \r\nHe went back a further two weeks later. Again his cast was not removed or re-cast. It was x-rayed again and again he was told it was fine and it wasn't. They put a layer of fibreglass over the top of the cast and in my view completely neglected skin viability where the cast should have been removed, area cleansed, re-xrayed properly and recast in the appropriate position. Instead he was told the following week he would get the cast off and it would be fine.  \r\nWhen the cast was finally removed and xrayed they said it was a lot worse than the original xray and break. (I was not surprised). The thumb appears to be fused in one position, he has no movement in his thumb. He is in pain. And he was not provided with so much as a hand support or splint but told it was fine and he was sent out the door.... His thumb is nearly still half an inch longer than his other thumb. He was on the phone to at least 3/4 people Friday to be made to feel like he was over exaggerating the issues in his hand.  \r\nAs a nurse myself I can confirm he is not over exaggerating. He further attended a&e on Sunday to be sent home and that they couldn't do anything for him, but if he wants it re xrayed to come back to a&e in 5 days but they'd not be able to do much for him. He has already lost 6 weeks of being able to do his job. He has gone back to a physical job where he needs dexterity and movement of his hand, and has found the use of his hand has completely limited what he can do. He cannot lift weights, he cannot squeeze a bottle of gel. He cannot use a fork or knife properly. He cannot move or do simple tasks with his hand, and it is his dominant right hand.  \r\nThis is something that could have been prevented. We strongly believe his hand should have been cast by a nurse practitioner, a doctor or Nurse who knows how the cast should have been done. Not someone who openly said they didn't know how to do a cast like this. I've never done a cast like this before. Had the cast been done right maybe we wouldn't be in this position. And maybe he wouldn't be suffering the way he is.  \r\nThe worry is that he will never get full function in his hand again. It is his job and future at stake. His broken fingers are the only broken bones healed properly and that was strapped and splinted by me, his wife, not the hospital.. And the excuse of it was too busy is a joke. Emergencies come in, yes, but it doesn't paint a very good picture when there's 3 or 4 in the waiting room post triage and a group of nurses at the nurses station. Absolutely appalled at the service and appalled that the treatment my husband received is hindering his work and career.","criticality":"strongly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-12-15T16:54:56.5633333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-12-20T14:08:20.023","readBy":[{"name":"Southern Health and Social Care Trust","count":5}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/903099","id":"903099"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/903099/responses","id":"903099"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/903099/healthservices","id":"903099"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/903099/tags","id":"903099"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_32024_180","id":"ZT003_32024_180","score":1},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appalled","id":"appalled"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20listened%20to","id":"not listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/broken%20bones","id":"broken bones"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dislocated","id":"dislocated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctors","id":"doctors"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/time%20management","id":"time management"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/training","id":"training"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20worried","id":"very worried"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/904167","id":"904167"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/908198","id":"908198"}]},{"id":903519,"author":"Mother bear","authorRoleId":3,"authorRole":"a parent/guardian","title":"Tongue tie fix","body":"My child was born with a tongue tie, which made breastfeeding VERY painful, causing sore and cracked nipples and sometimes bleeding of the nipple, as the latch couldn't happen properly and the gums were being used to do the work of the tongue.

I actually found this 5 week course really reassuring and a really good group of people. Grant and Jason who lead the group were really down to earth and easy to talk to and very informative when making the discission rehab was or wasn't for me?. We had two people who came to the group who had come out of rehab who spoke about there experience and what to expect which I found very helpful and insight to what to expect. Grant gave us weekly assignments not difficult ones like looking up certain rehabs our thoughts on them and preference,&nbsp; finding a video and having to watch it. Then we would talk about it in group. The only really challenging bit that I found tough was the final assignment where we had to write why I wanted rehab&nbsp; and why now? While writing it I brought up things that I had suppressed by my addiction. Then had to read it out in group.

Ridiculous. \n\nIt was not my fault that we missed the appointments. \n\nThe booking system is flawed and I know for a fact that my son should be made a priority for an appointment, as there was a technical error that prevented me from receiving notifications. \n\nBeing told that it's an automatic system that books appointments and nothing can be done to make him a priority is ridiculous as it was not my fault that we were not contacted. Furthermore I wouldn't purposely miss his appointments especially after waiting almost a year.

Staff make sure I have everything I need while also providing me with great company throughout their busy days.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-12-18T16:03:46.7333333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-12-20T16:17:51.52","readBy":[{"name":"Southern Health and Social Care Trust","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/903968","id":"903968"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/903968/responses","id":"903968"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/903968/healthservices","id":"903968"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/903968/tags","id":"903968"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_33020-medical-f","id":"ZT003_33020-medical-f","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/company","id":"company"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/impact%20of%20covid-19","id":"impact of covid-19"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/virtual%20visiting","id":"virtual visiting"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%2019","id":"covid 19"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/905800","id":"905800"}]},{"id":904005,"author":"bus man","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"They took good care of me","body":"Went to hospital for pacemaker repair the operation went well and I would like to thank all the staff for looking after me, they were very professional in their work and thanks to dr yerramasu for a job well done and all the nurses in ward 21 and 23 for taking good care of me thank you all x","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-12-18T23:02:02.2366667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-12-20T16:20:43.87","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Fife","count":6},{"name":"Fife Health & Social Care Partnership","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/904005","id":"904005"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/904005/responses","id":"904005"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/904005/healthservices","id":"904005"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/904005/tags","id":"904005"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/f704h_320","id":"F704H_320","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cardiology","id":"cardiology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dedicated%20staff","id":"dedicated staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctor","id":"doctor"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good%20job","id":"good job"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/operation","id":"operation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pacemaker","id":"pacemaker"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professional","id":"professional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/more%20help","id":"more help"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/905359","id":"905359"}]},{"id":904050,"author":"JulieT63","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"High Wycombe Breast Unit","body":"I just want to say how amazing the service is at the High Wycombe Breast Unit.

Despite being referred to them a little over two years ago by my GP who had tried anything and everything to help improve my crumbling mental health at that point (largely unsuccessful), I am yet to receive the care I once naively believed was going to be extended to me. Despite communicating my increasingly worsening suicidal tendencies and psychotic features to my designated nurse at every opportunity (that is when I am lucky enough to get a hold of them), my experience is that I have been given very little but empty promises followed often by extended periods of non-response and total communication blackouts. I have a long-standing, confirmed diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder + other persistent mood affective disorder. Psychotherapy (CBT, DIT, etc.) has proven to be ineffective for me from a sustainable, long-term perspective. I have an extensive history of alcohol misuse, although I have been abstinent for just over four months. I am heavily obese and physically disabled, suffering with a multitude of chronic conditions for which I take meds daily. I am an ex-academic and hold a PhD!  \r\nI have never wanted to end my life as much as I do now. The only thing that has come out of this exhausting process thus far is a prescription of antidepressants via proxy (I never got a chance to speak directly with the Consultant), which has done nothing for me in line with all the other SSRIs my GP had previously put me on.  \r\nThe service never looked into reviewing this for me despite repeatedly promising so. It has taken me over two years to convince the Trust that I need to be referred for a psychiatric/medication review. And then I was told to just wait for my appointment, even though the person responsible evidently forgot to book one for me! After many weeks of suspense and upon relentless chasing on my behalf, a Psychiatrist consultation has finally been booked for me for mid-Feb 2022 (and how do I even know this one's real?!).  \r\nIn my opinion this is not nearly good enough WLMHT. I have been nothing but patient, polite and understanding, especially given the ongoing Covid uncertainties affecting us all equally. But I feel I have reached the end of the proverbial rope at this point. I am constantly paranoid, tearful, anxious and suicidal, and have been self-harming to no end and they are aware of this. What does one have to do in this country to get some decent psychiatric care? All I am pleading for is adequate and timely help (i.e. correct diagnosis/medication) before I inevitably 'give up'. I have sought help repeatedly and in the most vulnerable way.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-12-17T21:36:19.6266667","progress":"Story has a

lack of pillows in most of the beds and some beds had none. This is a small thing that would be really helpful to be improved upon.  \r\nThere seems to be only one toilet in ED in the green area, however every time I have come into ED it always seems to be out of order, this is possibly from the overcrowds of people coming in and there is only one to accommodate them all. There needs to be more toilets available to us. The staff in ED are amazing how they cope with the busyness of the ward amazes me, they manage it very well and are very hard working people.  \r\nThe next morning I was moved up onto the orthopaedic ward. The haematology team are looking after me and their care is wonderful, very friendly people, they are brilliant at what they do, communication between me and the staff has been excellent, they have explained everything to me very well and even listen to my points and concerns.  \r\nI have to say also when I was here before the medical team that was looking after me they were also astonishing. I thank them greatly as the care they provided to me was great.  \r\nCleanliness of the hospital and this ward have been great, it’s good to see that there is always someone going around cleaning and sanitizing, brings comfort to me know that the staff are so on top of the cleanliness.","criticality":"minimally critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-12-17T17:43:08.1733333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-12-20T16:38:07.077","readBy":[{"name":"Southern Health and Social Care Trust","count":4}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/903708","id":"903708"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/903708/responses","id":"903708"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/903708/healthservices","id":"903708"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/903708/tags","id":"903708"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_32024_180","id":"ZT003_32024_180","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_32024_303","id":"ZT003_32024_303","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing%20staff","id":"amazing staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cleanliness","id":"cleanliness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/safe","id":"safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/toilets","id":"toilets"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/more%20pillows","id":"more pillows"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/905799","id":"905799"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/910608","id":"910608"}]},{"id":904021,"author":"Baldeagle","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Great care from start to finish","body":"I was due a procedure to release an entrapped ulna nerve, once again the care that was shown from start to finish was bang on. cannot compliment all the staff that were involved from being admitted to being discharged.
