Automated check in not working & poor receptionist doing a valiant job of i) dealing with pt in front of her, ii) breaking off every time a new pt came thru door so they wdnt get bashed to encourage them to come right in iii) back to pt in front of her iv) when finished she then had to patiently explain the magical mystery tour to the btm of lift/stairs. I watched this time & motion insanity, let at least 6 pts in front of me but it was scrambling my autism & making me feel even more ill so i wrote a note to receptionist, slipped it under screen & told her i'd wait round the corner so she cd come & find me when there was a gap. As well as easing the brain frying scene in the absence of a *simple* sign over the door, i hoped it wd i) ease pressure on brilliant receptionist & ii) speed other pts thru who do have time pressures. Sooner/later lovely receptionist came thru & we did whatever. I told her all it needed was a simple sign over the door to save her & colls all that extra work& that I'd like2 speak2someone 2sort that when they had a moment. I reassured her it was not a complaint against her but *for* her & ease this obvious log jam (also a serious h&s egress exit problem). I have worked as a professional in h&s & signage placement on 1st & 2nd floor is positively dangerous in the event of a fire. I had plenty of time it didnt matter where i felt so poorly & safer& nicer for receptionist & pts if receptionists are not having2 continuously explain blocked reception area. Sooner or later someone came along whose grammatically medically evident sex ..she did not invite me to explain my observation she just assumed i was a selfish patient who was complaining for myself, the very *last* thing i was doing, even though i had waited at least 30mins for receptionist to get to me & *chosen* to do that *for* her & *for* other pts. In fact i wanted to suggest a *solution* that would save receptionists work & stress & ease patient throughput (systems engineering was my actual profession) This dear lady launched in to \"It's temporary\"in fact new building has been live since 19 Feb ie 4 months \"You've got to understand only one receptionist\". In fact i understood that salient fact very well which was why i was going *out* of my way to *help* everybody *else*. Its almost like this lady thinks all pts are nasty, selfish people but in fact some of us want to give reception staff basic arrangements that some ppl might think were the responsibility of the surgery management. After an autistic meltdown due to this bizarre response (which may be breach of Equality Act 2010: Autism as Id'd by excellent GP at St Ps) a Dr was kind & said come back at 5pm. I came back at 5pm with the relevant sign & some more with the lovely new logo (at my own expense). Lovely receptionist was really happy& agreed (as did others) they no longer had to waste time explaining how to get to the bottom of the stairs/lift.

She made me feel welcome straight away. I was given an appointment for a Health Check on Wednesday 14th June with a nurse.  \n\nThe nurse was again, polite, friendly, caring and informative.  My BP was rather high so she suggested I checked it at home later on and call the surgery with the numbers later.  When I eventually founded my BP monitor, it was too late in the day to phone.  After 2 readings, last night and this morning, I decided to see if I might be lucky to have an appointment with a doctor today. I was phoned at 09.02 by a very pleasant doctor.   Not only did we sort out a 7 day monitoring of my BP but after a short discussion about my general health, it was suggested I see the MSK practitioner and an appointment was made for Tuesday 27th June.\n\nI should like to thank everyone I've spoken to so far for their friendly, caring manner, for listening to me and for making me feel like a human being again instead of just a  statistic.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2023-06-25T07:56:50","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2023-06-25T20:23:06","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1082830","id":"1082830"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1082830/responses","id":"1082830"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1082830/healthservices","id":"1082830"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1082830/tags","id":"1082830"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/e82093","id":"E82093","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disillusioned","id":"disillusioned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lucky","id":"lucky"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20lucky","id":"very lucky"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/welcome","id":"welcome"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/like%20myself","id":"like myself"}]},{"id":1082832,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Fantastic practice ","body":"It was calming atmosphere people were kind, friendly and professional.

I decided that rather than waiting forever, I would get my husband to try to tape my gash together at home.  I think instead of paying people to sit behind a screen and relying on technology to do their work, the NHS needs to use their receptionist to interact with the people in the waiting room advising them what is happening and how long it is likely to be before they will be seen by a medic.  Not impressed with St Richards use of technology while the receptionist is left to chat to colleagues instead of interacting with their patients.

I asked if the review could have been completed as a telephone appointment, the answer was yes as I have my own peak flow meter. Some feedback:\n- send patients a text confirmation of their appointments\n- offer patients telephone appointments where possible\n-  I prefer the plan sent as an SMS attachment. Don't print the plan unless this is what the patient prefers.  \n\nThank you \n","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2023-06-23T14:33:58","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-06-25T20:26:52","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1082837","id":"1082837"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1082837/responses","id":"1082837"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1082837/healthservices","id":"1082837"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1082837/tags","id":"1082837"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/f86058","id":"F86058","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/asthma","id":"asthma"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/face","id":"face"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/in%20control","id":"in control"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/out%20of%20control","id":"out of control"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/peak%20flow","id":"peak flow"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/test","id":"test"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doing%20well","id":"doing well"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1094028","id":"1094028"}]},{"id":1082836,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Brilliant practice","body":"Old Courthouse is an excellent surgery, with wonderful staff. The doctors and nurses are knowledgable and professional but also sympathetic and friendly. It's very efficiently run in terms of getting appointments, prescriptions and referrals. Recently, I had a phone consultation for knee pain. Very quickly I was sent a link to book an MRI scan which I had within the week. I have already had the results explained to me by both a physio and a doctor at the surgery and have now been referred to hospital for further treatment.

There was even a fair amount of CBT done out in the community which was a great learning experience and broke down many negative beliefs I had about myself and others.
