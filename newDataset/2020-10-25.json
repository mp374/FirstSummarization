This was at 2.30, At 4.30 my transport still had not arrived and I asked a passing nurse if it had been booked. Her attitude was appalling, She said \"Of course its been booked\" very aggressively. There was no need for that. My transport eventually arrived and as I was leaving the same nurse followed me and said\"Oh you're leaving, Bye then\"very sarcastically.

When I tried to book an appointment I was repeatedly told to look online even though I kept telling them my symptoms were not on the online tool and I needed to speak to a doctor over the phone. I was then asked what I wanted to speak to the doctor about and I said I’d prefer not to go into detail and they said I had to if I wanted the appointment. I said there is no rule or NHS stipulation that I needed to do that. The receptionist then said if I wouldn’t explain the reason I would not be given an appointment to speak to a doctor and would need to use the website.

This hospital in general is good however If It can be safely delayed, I would not recommend having any surgery during the pandemic.  Let me explain.\n\nMy dad had a bypass surgery and no visitors are allowed during his stay. We would call him everyday on his mobile to keep in touch. One day I asked him to call over a nurse for a health update. I overheard the nurse say in a rude tone. \"Yes! What do you want!\". I guess she didn't know he was on the phone. Bearing in mind he has a language barrier, he is weak and can barely speak. This is no way to speak to a patient who just had heart surgery. She didn't even come over to ask if everything is okay. Without family being able to visit the ward. Care provided is questionable. You really dont know how the patient is being treated.\n\nIt gets worse. Once I got my dad home and tried to give his medication. I noticed a box of blood thinning clopidogrel tablets were missing. The nurses FORGOT to pack them. This is negligence on the hospitals part. As they should have a procedure to double check everything is supplied and signed off. None of the discharge documents were signed off.

The frontline staff are dragging the surgery into gutter.I am one of first thirty patient who registered when this surgery opened. Never had any complain. New staff need to learn form long serving staff. I had appointment to have injection on 23rd October 2020. After all the formalities I was asked to hand over the injection which I didn't have and neither did I know that I had to pickup from chemist. The nurse did try and check if that injection was available in the surgery. Negative so she said I will have to rebook my appointment and being helpful looked on the systems and asked if I could attend same day 3pm for the injection. I accepted and went to chemist for injection he didn't get the prescription so he sent his staff to pick up the prescription. Normally my prescription is electronically sent. I  got the injection and arrived at the surgery door 2.58pm. At this point receptionist and the nurse had cup in their hands and making their way upstairs. I asked am I late they replied through locked door the doctor is not here receptionist said he will come at 3.30pm and nurse said he won't be long.I said why didn't you tell me to come at 3.30. What am I going to do. They just walked upstairs. I am insulin dependent diabetic,chronic heart disease. Difficulty standing for long period and am over 70 years of age.I was very worried as I knew by 4pm I would need snack or I will collapse. I went to buy sweets and came back at 3.30pm and the nurse called me for injection. I asked who is giving me the injection she said I am. I said you lied to me that doctor was not there so I will have to wait. Why didn't you give me 3.30 appointment. She went to the doctor and said \"I refuse to give him injection as he is rude\". I said I am diabetic and had to eat sweet to keep my strenght whilst her attitude was out of line. If you are refusing then I will report this to CQC. She asked me togo for injection and said  I thought you were going to wait in the car.I said I don't have a car. She said surgery was empty you could have waited inside. I said you walked upstairs and I had to go. I said to her check my record she said she didn't want to. She kept trying to call surgery owner GP.
