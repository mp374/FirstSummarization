After a three hour wait she had her blood pressure tested, unrelated to the reason she was there, and it was high, the doctor was most concerned and scared the hell out of her informing her she is in imminent danger of a stroke or heart attack.  \r\nBy magic she got an appointment to see a GP the next day, miracle. Previous to that my wife had an appointment that would have meant a five-week wait. We also purchased our own blood pressure testing machine and as an act of solidarity I test myself. Guess what, mine was even higher !!!!  \r\nI called my surgery, Alfred Squire Road, and there were no appointments left and given recent experience I knew if I called the surgery the appointment would be weeks away. Bearing in mind my blood pressure was higher than my wife's and her readings were considered dangerously high then you can imagine the idea of waiting several weeks would be somewhat alarming.  \r\nSo I call the surgery and I simply would not wait and would take the responsibility for my situation, reflecting on my wife's experience. Miracle, got an appointment for next day, I did not see a doctor but a nurse practitioner, they checked my BP 4 times and said that I should log my BP twice a day for 14 days and I would need a blood test, I would receive a link via text to book an appointment. I have not received a link, also I haven't a clue what the name of the nurse is so who do I give my test results to??  \r\nI was not given a follow-up appointment to discuss any medication or any treatment plan. This means I will either have to queue up at 8 o'clock in the morning or call and be in a very long queue - the other option is to book an appointment in 6 weeks plus in the future.  \r\nSo I have dangerously high blood pressure, and have had no treatment or prospect of getting any. I will have to call my surgery for the fourth time to see a resolution and I understand that stress is bad for people with hypertension","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-03-23T20:22:39.45","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-04-03T09:20:00.123","readBy":[{"name":"The Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1046187","id":"1046187"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1046187/responses","id":"1046187"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1046187/healthservices","id":"1046187"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1046187/tags","id":"1046187"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rl4","id":"RL4","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frustrated","id":"frustrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/alarmed","id":"alarmed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appointments","id":"appointments"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20test","id":"blood test"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/high%20blood%20pressure","id":"high blood pressure"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hypertension","id":"hypertension"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/phone%20system","id":"phone system"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting%20time","id":"waiting time"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/follow-up%20care","id":"follow-up care"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1050521","id":"1050521"}]},{"id":1047195,"author":"saturnsf65","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Lack of pain relief","body":"I asked for pain medication last week because the tablets I had were not doing the job.

My mum was very ill, had not passed urine for nearly 36 hours, went to the surgery at 8.30 when it opened to ask for a GP phone call, was told by the receptionist that this could not be requested in person but had to do it online or telephone.  \r\nMum obviously stressed the urgency but was told it was procedure. So Mum had to return home to call and was number 20 in the queue and waited nearly an hour to speak to someone. A doctor didn’t ring, so at 11 am Mum rang again, number 18 in the queue and waited 45 minutes to be connected. In all this time, Mum is writhing in agony and is getting more poorly.  \r\nFinally the surgery paramedic came out and was absolutely fantastic. Had an ambulance booked and mum pre admitted within 10 minutes. Thank you to the paramedic, as they undoubtedly made a massive difference to Mum's treatment when she arrived at Treliske.  \r\nMy issue is this: merging the two surgeries was supposed to make the GPs more accessible and ease the system. Not being able to request a doctor in person at the surgery is extremely concerning, especially for elderly ones who don’t understand the internet or need more urgent treatment.  \r\nI think this protocol needs to change as it is affecting patient health and ultimately could lead to a death.

She was kept in the Medical Assessment Unit for 2 days, then moved to a different ward in the hospital. When my elderly dad and I arrived to visit her yesterday, we were told she had been moved to the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh. No one had phoned us to tell us of the transfer and when we eventually saw my mum she was very upset and distressed.  \r\nWe still have not had any contact from any doctor or staff nurse to tell us what medication my mum has had or what the plan is, even after me asking staff numerous times, no one seems to know.  \r\nWhen we arrived in her new ward, mum was in a sitting room waiting on her room being ready with no one with her, she was cold and looked frightened. We sat with her for a while and no one came to speak to us. I actually went to find someone when it was time for us to leave as I was anxious that no one had asked me about mum and the level of dementia she has or what she could or couldn't do for herself.  \r\nI eventually found a student nurse, who took down all the information I could think of at that time.  \r\nMy mum is unable to do anything for herself and ask for any help, so if only one of the staff had spoke to us, the family, then they could have wrote on her notes.  \r\nThis has left the whole family worried and upset for mum and I think the transfer could have been dealt with better for communication to both us and to mum in a way that wasn't so frightening for her.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-03-30T10:46:33.8433333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-04-03T10:21:47.223","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lothian","count":12}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1048884","id":"1048884"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1048884/responses","id":"1048884"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1048884/healthservices","id":"1048884"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1048884/tags","id":"1048884"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/s116h-acute-elderly-medicine","id":"S116H-acute-elderly-medicine","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/s314h_180","id":"S314H_180","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/s314h_502","id":"S314H_502","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/annoyed","id":"annoyed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxious","id":"anxious"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/worried","id":"worried"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care%20plan","id":"care plan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dementia","id":"dementia"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/elderly","id":"elderly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/level%20of%20care","id":"level of care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medical%20assessment","id":"medical assessment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/transfer","id":"transfer"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1049902","id":"1049902"}]},{"id":1049624,"author":"scorecarddz56","authorRoleId":8,"authorRole":"a staff member posting for a patient/service user","title":"Such wonderful staff","body":"I have been in hospital almost two weeks.

I’d need to be in hospital for between 3 and 4 nights. It was all organised, they told me they would arrange interpreters, that was great and I was happy that I knew there would be an interpreter for me the whole time. I arrived on the Tuesday and the surgery was due on Wednesday morning. They weren’t sure how long I would be in hospital for, whether it would be until Thursday or Friday as it depended on the outcome of the surgery.  \r\nWhen we got to the hospital, there was an interpreter on arrival. I went in with my wife and daughter, she lives in London and she came in to support me, I then spoke to the interpreter and said I take it you’re in everyday I am here for? (3 or 4 days). The interpreter said they were only booked for that one appointment, so I asked what happened over the next few days - they said they didn’t know, so, I started to get worried because I knew I was going to need an interpreter every day I was in, it was serious treatment, so the interpreter said this patient is going to need an interpreter, it was a nurse they spoke to, the nurse was quite young and we were in the middle of a nurses strike at the time, the nurse said something about not being able to afford an interpreter for all these days, our interpreter said that they’ll need to. A senior member of staff came over in a red uniform, we said you need to book this before 5pm while the interpreter office is still open, so they rang through, to try and book an interpreter, but we were left not knowing what would happen.  \r\n**Patient’s wife**: I went home very worried about what would happen when I left that evening - we were both worried about whether or not there would be an interpreter the next day.  \r\nThe surgery was booked for 8am, but there was no interpreter in sight, so surgery was delayed until 10am. My husband started to get anxious as there had been a lot of pressure to go ahead with this surgery and get it done because it was needed and very important.  \r\nThen, the interpreter arrived at 10am to consent to the surgery but they were only booked until 1pm with no one booked for him waking up in recovery, so we were anxious the whole way through about who will communicate with him after surgery, what will happen, will someone else come through?  \r\n**Patient**: That interpreter told me there wouldn’t be an interpreter there for waking up in recovery and I would be waking up with no communication support. My daughter can sign a bit, so I asked if she can help me when I wake up from surgery. I think my daughter naively thought that would be okay. I was due to come out of surgery about 2pm, so – my daughter came down and I woke up in recovery and a doctor came over and when they looked at my situation the doctor spoke to my daughter and said, tell your dad to raise your hands in the air, but I couldn’t, my limbs weren’t working properly, my daughter saw this, and told my doctor and the doctor said this isn’t good you need her to leave out of the recovery room to get her away from what was going on here because something wasn’t right.  \r\nSo, then the doctor carried out some other procedures, it all went a bit dramatic around me and I don’t know what happened so I was just lying there, she was put out the room, but she was my daughter not an interpreter. There was a blockage of blood in my body and I needed a stent. So, then the doctor brought my daughter back in and said ask your dad to raise his hands now but I actually had a worse reaction at that point, my body became paralysed even worse than before, she started to cry and was in floods of tears not knowing what was going on and she was asked to go out of the room again as they tried to re-insert the stent again going through four different attempts to do this, it was high drama, the doctor asked her to come back in again and ask me to raise my hands again and I could which was good for me because my body was responding now, but my daughter was in floods of tears because of all of this, then I had to be rushed for an MRI to check my brain due to lack of oxygen, they were rushing me out the room to get an MRI done quickly. Everything was done in a bit of a panic, they realised there was no damage done. But, there should have been an interpreter the whole way through with me including the MRI, it shouldn’t have been my daughter it should have been an interpreter. My daughter seeing me knowing I might have been brain damaged was difficult. A doctor told my daughter there had been no brain damage, and the surgeon said that it was a very rare occurrence, and that it was the first time in 20 years that he had seen this happening.  \r\n**Patient’s wife**: The details around what was going on at that point are still quite unclear because of the lack of clear communication, e.g. we are unsure if it was 20 years exactly.  \r\n**Patient**: I was then put into the recovery room for 24 hours with a nurse coming in doing regular observations and checking my limbs working, with no interpreter in sight the entire time I was there. My daughter came back down and she did her best to try and tell me what they were saying, but it shouldn’t have been her, it should have been an interpreter. Eventually I was put back on a ward, my wife and daughter were allowed to see me but still no interpreter.  \r\nEventually one was brought in on the Thursday morning, it was the first time one came back again, they were meant to come in for a consultation with the doctor and the were booked from 10am-12pm but the doctor wasn’t available at that time and so we didn’t get to talk to the doctor because the interpreter had to leave and the doctor was not available in these short 2 hours.  \r\n**Patient’s wife**: While my husband was in the recovery room there were 3 spoken language interpreters in that area and it broke my heart to see that if you have a spoken language you get an interpreter, but for a deaf person, we don’t get one, and we felt so badly treated, it was heart breaking to see that happening.  \r\n**Patient**: We are so grateful to our daughter for doing what she could but this had a massive impact on her. She was very upset. She is back in London now and she had to take a week off work because she was so distressed by what she experienced. Seeing that happening to me, she couldn’t go back into work. And I think what I want to say is I am still in recovery, I have a long way to go, but this thing around booking interpreters has been very difficult and disappointing and has really knocked our confidence in the services that we attend.  \r\n**Patient’s wife**: Trying to get to see or speak to a GP or a doctor at a hospital isn’t easy and I want to have more email contact opportunities, because at this point in time we are having to ask for things and go in in person instead. I think a lot of communication systems need to be changed for us deaf people to get better access in the future.  \r\n**Patient**: Just before the surgery happened, I was left lying there, at that time the doctor was around and wanted to talk to me, and not having an interpreter booked, honestly I can’t explain what that felt like, having all these professionals standing around me waiting for surgery and not being able to communicate with them. When letters come out they ask if you need an interpreter and we asked for one and we knew it was a couple of days in advance so we actually drove to the hospital and tried to find the office, because we didn’t trust them to book an interpreter for us, so we handed a letter into them and they said we will make sure we book an interpreter because know you’re in for a few days and they said they would sort it out. We went into the hospital especially to make sure an interpreter would be booked and then look what happened.  \r\nThe doctor is lovely, the doctors themselves are really lovely. The medical staff and everyone treated me really well. But I should have had an interpreter with me 24/7 because it was so serious, we just wanted this to go smoothly and we want this to be improved for the future. There should have been interpreters there.  \r\n**Video of story in BSL **  \r\nThis is a translation by a BSL translator  \r\n[https://vimeo.com/819470342](https://vimeo.com/819470342)  \r\n**Video of story in ISL **  \r\nThis is a translation by an ISL translator  \r\n[https://vimeo.com/819470417](https://vimeo.com/819470417)","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-03-28T16:11:38.7033333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-04-03T12:52:01.983","readBy":[{"name":"Belfast Health and Social Care Trust","count":9},{"name":"Public Health Agency","count":2},{"name":"Patient and Client Council","count":1},{"name":"Ulster University, Faculty of Life and Health Sciences","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1048056","id":"1048056"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1048056/responses","id":"1048056"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1048056/healthservices","id":"1048056"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1048056/tags","id":"1048056"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt001-rvh-vascular-surgery","id":"ZT001-rvh-vascular-surgery","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/worried","id":"worried"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctors","id":"doctors"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/equality%20awareness","id":"equality awareness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medical%20staff","id":"medical staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/deaf%20interpreting","id":"deaf interpreting"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1050513","id":"1050513"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1058200","id":"1058200"}]},{"id":1049649,"author":"heron89","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Mirena coil insertion (failed)","body":"Mirena coil insertion failed  \r\nI don’t know where else to put this. I’m seriously considering complaining to the hospital but I don’t know if I just had a bad experience or they did something wrong.  \r\nA while ago I was referred to a gynae consultant to talk about having my tubes removed. I’m 100% one and done. Yes I’m 34in my 30s but I have issues with anxiety and childhood trauma. I love my daughter so much I want to cry - I don’t need another child. My partner supports this. But I’ve also had awful pms forever and have never got on with systemic hormonal contraceptives. The consultant refused the operation and they referred me instead for a Mirena. The consultant said insertion was simple and their colleague did dozens a day. Nothing to worry about. My periods would stop. My pms would be better. I hated the idea of a device inside me but I said I’d try it.  \r\nI arrived for the appointment. The dr thought I was there for removal - no, I corrected them, insertion. But I’d had them before? No. I said I was very scared. The doctor said it would hurt but couldn’t tell me how much. The nurse said we could stop any time. I asked what was going to happen - they said I’d get changed, get into a chair, then they’d insert it. I wanted more detail but I didn’t ask - I was terrified.  \r\nThere were two other people in the room. I don’t know who they were. No one introduced them. They talked about local anaesthetic- I was preparing for an injection, but the doctor used a spray. It burned. Later the doctor wanted to use an injection but by then I was too far gone to make a good decision. The speculum felt like it banged into my cervix and the doctor asked me to lie still. The nurse tried to distract me with chat. I asked them to talk me through what they were doing and what was about to happen. They stopped telling me what was going on after the speculum was set.  \r\nThen I felt the most excruciating pain. It was a huge shock. Sharp and bruising. I jumped and cried out. Immediately I started crying and shaking. I don’t know what they were doing. Maybe it was the sound - The doctor later told me they had got as far as dilating the cervix. I don’t know.  \r\nI was shaking and crying. I desperately wanted to be brave and manage to withstand this. I'd been told my experience would be really down to how I handled the pain. I felt like I was failing. The nurse offered me gas and air - I didn’t like how it made me feel but I thought it would help. The dr wanted to give me an injection but I was so panicked I could let bear the thought. So they did more spray - then there was more pain. Sharp and tearing and hot and awful. I couldn’t stop shaking and started saying I'm so sorry I can’t, please stop. The nurse agreed it should stop - the dr said they didn’t want to continue and had to do it under sedation. I panicked saying I had to drive - I didn’t understand that she meant to put me on the list for a procedure under sedation.  \r\nThe nurse was lovely but I was in shock. The nurse offered to make me tea but I refused - I wanted to run away. Then made me sit and drink water but all I wanted was to get dressed and leave. I felt violated and ashamed and I was in so much pain.  \r\nI walked to the car although I don’t really remember leaving the hospital - I got in and wept. Proper sobs. Drove home 30 minutes and spent most of the rest of the day crying. I took more painkillers and slept for an hour but I’m still in pain now and I’m exhausted. Every time I think about it I start crying and shaking  \r\nI will never ever recommend this to any other women. I know everyone had different experiences but I am appalled at how invasive and brutal this process is.  \r\nI’m done with having things done to me as a woman. I’m done with messing with my hormones and hurting my body so that I don’t get pregnant. I am angry and in pain.

Thank you All.","body":"Last year in the summer I fell and broke my right hip unfortunately it was when the ambulances were over worked, the waiting was at its longest. Luckily my wait was only about an hour and when they came I had very good treatment from the 2 medics. Under the circumstances they were upbeat and gave me confidence in my care. My stay in hospital was at the point that everything was going digital so what with the demand for beds and all the other problems within the NHS it was understandable that they were rushed off their feet. Needless to say the treatment I had was second to none and my surgeon was there when my operation was done to reassure me.  \r\nThe Physio’s were fantastic with helping me with my recovery, and the hydrotherapy helped me a lot.  \r\nUnfortunately I fell and broke my shoulder this March and again the A&E were great to get me moved directly to the Fracture clinic, prior to my first appointment, I was called in to get a DXA scan. As my let arm was painful and I couldn’t move it, I felt it could be difficult for me to lay flat. I could have rescheduled that appointment , but I had been waiting since last Autumn so I don’t want to delay it. The Radiologist was called Ben and he was very understanding of my injury. He made me feel comfortable and he managed the scan without any problem's to both parties. He was very reassuring and explained every thing he needed to do before hand , giving me the opportunity to talk about it first.  \r\nI had a call from the physio department the next morning after my appointment with the fracture clinic. I have an appointment scheduled for 2 weeks time. What I am saying in a nut shell is that as far as my experience goes, I have every praise for the doctors, nurses, physios and staff that looked after me. I am a 72 year old woman , and have seen many changes in the way the NHS has developed, the technology may have changes but the thing that is constant, is the care these people give under the most difficult circumstances. Thank you All.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-03-31T11:02:27.8066667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-04-03T14:15:08.6","readBy":[{"name":"Royal

He had an ultrasound that October that confirmed he has a double hernia and surgery was recommended. Unfortunately my husband started to feel uncomfortable and returned to our GP in March 2022. The GP wrote to request that my husband be put on the urgent list. I have telephoned on numerous occasions and left voicemails and never received an update. I am well aware that COVID has had a huge impact on our NHS and all services are under increasing pressure but communication is a vital part of NHS Lanarkshire.  \r\nI contacted the hospital. The response was that they have looked into my husband's case. His GP has sent in two referrals and these were both considered routine and based on the information provided, his referral has been vetted as routine. Unfortunately the routine waiting time for the outpatient clinic is 87 weeks and the clinical team are prioritising clinical urgent/cancer patients. They understand my husband has been waiting for approximately 52 weeks and routine referrals can expect to wait up to 87 weeks.  \r\nThey appreciate this is very distressing for us and have asked the staff to keep my husband's name on file so that they can slot him into any clinic cancellations. If my husbands clinical condition has changed, we are advised to contact his GP.  \r\nI am concerned my husband has not been assessed by a surgeon so how can an accurate assessment be made? Has he to wait until his hernias strangulate with all the dangers that scenario has before he is assessed by a surgical team?

I thought we were having a very good discussion until we reached the section on baby sleep, where the person involved mentioned some information I did not agree on.  \r\nI bedshare with my baby, in line with the safe sleep guidelines, recently endorsed by NHS, as well as lullaby trust. The HCP not only told me that they couldn’t condone that (fair enough) but instead of pointing to the safe sleep guidelines, proceeded to tell me a story about a friend's sister who had rolled over and smothered her baby. At best, that is anecdotal, but at worst, incidents like this prevent people sharing what’s actually happening and lead to more unsafe bed sharing practices, and more infant deaths.  \r\nWhen I told the HCP that my baby woke up 3-4 times a night for a feed, they suggested feeding him porridge before bed. This not only doesn’t cause baby to sleep any better, but we’d also just discussed how my baby was new to solids and wasn’t really taking much in as yet!  \r\nThen when I suggested that perhaps he was waking for connection, not because he was hungry, they suggested I give him water instead of breastfeed him, as I usually do. From what I know, giving water to small babies is not right!  \r\nAs a well-educated second time mum, I am able to let comments such as these float over my head. But honestly, the fact that information like this is still being disseminated by healthcare professionals in an unclear way perpetuates stress felt by new mums, who are chronically under-supported.  \r\nPerhaps more training on normal infant sleep patterns could be provided.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-03-29T12:55:14.6033333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-04-03T14:48:59.823","readBy":[{"name":"Northern Health and Social Care Trust","count":10}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1048487","id":"1048487"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1048487/responses","id":"1048487"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1048487/healthservices","id":"1048487"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1048487/tags","id":"1048487"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt002-healthvisiting","id":"zt002-healthvisiting","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/angry","id":"angry"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frustrated","id":"frustrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/baby","id":"baby"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/deflated","id":"deflated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/health%20visitor","id":"health visitor"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/information","id":"information"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attitude","id":"staff attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/training","id":"training"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1050022","id":"1050022"}]},{"id":1049600,"author":"Marpm83","authorRoleId":7,"authorRole":"a staff member posting for a carer/relative","title":"Thanks to Hospice at Home service staff","body":"Jacinta and Vanessa are very helpful and caring towards the patient as well as the household people.

The reason I took myself off them without the help of the Mental Health Team at Claire House, was that I had been waiting months for a medication review, which never seemed to happen. I had previously spoken to them about how the medication was making me feel, and they act like they didn't care, so it prevented me from reaching out again when I took myself off them.  \r\nI was on antipsychotic medication and anxiety and depression medication, and over the years of trying to get help, help never seemed to come. When I came off them, at first things were hard, I had about a week of becoming really emotional, from uncontrollable laughter to historically crying, but it soon passed. For a few months I was doing amazing, better than I had ever done before, I was eating healthy, exercising, sleeping well and regularly, and keeping on top of my mental health and my environment, until one day, things escalated. It was like I was in a cage inside my head and three other people were in control of what I was saying and what I was doing.  \r\nI knew what I wanted to say and do, but the three others were controlling what I was doing and what I said. It would calm down for about 30 minutes at night, and then it was back, I could feel bees under my skin I could feel the buzzing and walking, I was being told by a voice I had never heard before that I was only allowed to eat red foods, or the whole world would end, but if I ate red foods then I would become the devil. So I was going days without eating anything and when I did, I felt this awful disappointment and panic.  \r\nWhen I tried to talk to people when it was bad, I was struggling to get words out of my mouth, my body didn't feel like my own I didn't feel like me at all. The staff at my supported accommodation got in touch with Claire House to get a medication review, as I was unwell and things were escalating, they gave me one 2 months away, so I had to take it into my own hands to medicate myself. Luckily I still had my old meds, so I started back up on the antipsychotics, and things started to ease and settle again.  \r\nI'm back on my medication now, and my medication review still hasn't happened. I'm experiencing terrifying nightmares that are making me fearful of sleeping but I have to sleep because I have been exhausted due to the disruption of sleep. Recovery North are finally trying to speed my meds review forward, my self-harm has become more frequent and I have no energy to engage in healthy activities.  \r\nIf there wasn't such a long waiting list, I wouldn't have needed to try and fix my medication on my own, if the team involved in my medication would have helped me when I was struggling with them, then I wouldn't have chosen to come off them unsupported. If they actually had a functional working and better funded and staffed team, people wouldn't be suffering to access help and support and would feel heard and listened to, not distant and feel I have to take things into my own hands.

I was coping with it all on my own, trying to do it , so they started a system, I think it was a trial, where they sent you a Macmillan nurse as like liaison with me and my husband for getting what we needed at that time .  \r\nIt was the doctors (our local GP practice) that told us about it, and then you get someone come and see you and ask how they can help. I didn’t want to miss the opportunity to feed back because this girl has been wonderful, she cares and she helped me so much because I was drowning in it all. I had so much going on so I want to share this good feedback. I think the service is a trial and I think they are trying to get money to make it a permanent thing which they deserve because a lot of people could be helped by these people and Nichola was made for this job, she has been wonderful.  \r\nI’ve had so many people come and go. All I know is I can phone up one day and she is there to help us in any way she can, not just with the cancer but with everything. I’m not good online and so many things need you to go online. It’s not easy,when you’ve got a very sick husband and everything like that. I said I’m not getting anywhere with these people trying to move us, (as we needed to move house somewhere more suitable for my husbands needs). She came and she listened and she wrote it all down, the next day she rang me and said you’ve been treated appallingly and I’m going to help you out.  \r\nShe helped me with things like appointments, unfortunately my husband has a neurological problem as well where the nerves in his arms and legs are broken and so he was falling and had all sorts of things going on without the cancer. She was so kind and helped me organise his appointments. Sometimes they send you an appointment and then they cancel it etc and things like that she helped me with because you have so much to do, and you don’t know whether you’re coming or going, so she helped with the process of trying to get another place to live.  \r\nWe’ve moved house now we’ve got a ground floor and have a wet room now so my husband doesn’t have to climb the stairs. It’s a warden assisted place. I even have a gardener now, I can’t believe it myself, it’s for people over 65, the warden comes every morning to make sure you’re okay. And I feel like that wouldn’t have happened without Nicola.  \r\nShe’s taken us off the books now because she’s gone as far as she can go, and she explained that she can only have so many patients and there’s so many people wanting the service, so asked it alright if I take you off my books? That was recently but she did add that any time that we needed her we could call her. Sometimes you try and do these things on your own and sometimes you do need a bit of help.  \r\nIf someone has done a job well then you should say so. She’s been so lovely to us, and you’ve only got to ring her, whatever problem and she’s on the case, when you’ve got all this going on there’s so much to do.  \r\nI wasn’t even allowed to go to the hospital after he had surgery, he needed part of his lung removing. The surgeon at Barts hospital rang me on the day of the surgery to tell me it had gone well and to say not to worry and I thought that was wonderful! It was during the pandemic when we weren’t allowed in because of Covid. It was so kind of the surgeon to ring me and let me know he’s alright, because I was sat at some alone all day worrying about him, on my own because of lock down. They are wonderful at Barts hospital, they really are, and everyone on that team has been absolutely smashing. We have a lot to thank them for and even the aftercare, the medical and clinical oncology teams have all been so kind. After that he had some chemo but the chemo made him so bad, it was because he had this underlying problem which they hadn’t even started to try to understand what was happening with him. It took three years of doing tests to realise it isn’t Parkinson’s its something else.  \r\nThank you so much to Nichola from Macmillan and the team at Barts who have helped us so much.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-03-27T15:59:13.8033333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-04-03T18:20:06.88","readBy":[{"name":"East London NHS Foundation Trust","count":5},{"name":"Barts Health NHS Trust","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1047395","id":"1047395"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1047395/responses","id":"1047395"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1047395/healthservices","id":"1047395"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1047395/tags","id":"1047395"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/f84055","id":"F84055","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/r1hm0","id":"R1HM0","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rwk-tower-hamlets-com","id":"rwk-tower-hamlets-com","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/aftercare","id":"aftercare"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cancer","id":"cancer"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/chemo","id":"chemo"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gp%20surgery","id":"gp surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helpful","id":"helpful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/integrated%20care","id":"integrated care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lung","id":"lung"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/macmillan","id":"Macmillan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/macmillan%20nurses","id":"macmillan nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/oncology","id":"oncology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgeon","id":"surgeon"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported","id":"supported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wonderful%20staff","id":"wonderful staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/great%20team","id":"great team"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/available","id":"available"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pandemic","id":"pandemic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid","id":"covid"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1050720","id":"1050720"}]},{"id":1048408,"author":"leopardzr44","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Great practice","body":"I have never had any problems with the Practice and feel some of the comments I've seen are unfair.

I tried phoning many times - 30 to 50 minutes waiting time on the phone, listening to a repeated message saying it was easy to book ‘exclusive’ appointments (what other kind are there?) via the Ask First Ap. I tried the Ap, which tells you when you use it that Sydenham Group Practice does not offer nurse’s appointments via this portal. I tried via Patient Access (which appears below the words “book an appointment” on the surgery's website). I saw a message saying I had reached a permissible limit on making appointments this way, despite not having made one for at least two years.\n\nAt the same time, I contacted the front desk using their on line form enquiring how I could get my repeat prescription, as this had vanished from Patient Access, and was told by text from the Assistant Practice Manager that I needed to make an appointment for a medication review. I replied “how”, given the problems experienced? I received no reply. Contacting the same person a few days later, telling her I had had no success with phoning or using the Ask First Ap, I was told to “try signing out and in again”. Of course, I had already done that multiple times, even trying in the middle of the night to see if it made any difference and trying out different permutations in the tick box answers required. Do you want advice/ treatment/referral/other? It made no difference, there are never any appointments.\n\nI called again on 24th March and got to number one in the queue – then the phone rang and rang and no-one answered. I emailed the Practice Manager – no reply yet, six days later. \n\nEventually today, I got through, using two telephones simultaneously. When I explained the difficulty I had had, the receptionist told me that Sydenham Green Group Practice is not offering any appointment bookings on Patient Access, but the receptionist could not explain why the website invites you to do so. She also said that it is not possible to make an appointment for a medication review via the Ask First Ap, yet I had been instructed to do that by the Assistant Manager. The doctors – if you get to see one – are good. But the management of this surgery has been baleful for a long time but it is simply beyond a joke now. And yet they are looking to take on more patients! \n\n\n","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2023-03-30T13:33:31","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-04-03T19:12:27","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1049975","id":"1049975"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1049975/responses","id":"1049975"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1049975/healthservices","id":"1049975"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1049975/tags","id":"1049975"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/g85024","id":"G85024","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/group","id":"group"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20good","id":"not good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/test","id":"test"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/made%20a%20difference","id":"made a difference"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/in%20the%20way","id":"in the way"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1095204","id":"1095204"}]},{"id":1049974,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Poor service","body":"I attended the hospital for an ultrasound in February and the staff were brilliant, however it was the talk of the place that lots of people hadn’t turned up for their appointment.
