He was given the all clear and then 2 weeks later he was given only months to live - there is something badly wrong here. He suffered with the same pain in his head and eye from the first time he came out of Altnagelvin hospital. From his first treatment during covid the pain was mention at every appointment he has been to, and that’s a hell of a lot.  \r\nHe was admitted into Omagh hospital and primary care palliative care ward. This was supposed to be for two weeks. He ended up spending twelve weeks there on a syringe driver and was discharged still with the same pain. On numerous occasions we had to bring him to the GP and also ring them and the pain was mentioned at every single appointment he attended in Altnagelvin.  \r\nThey did a CT scan from the neck down even though he was suffering from pain in his head and eye. I asked why they didn’t scan his head and the doctor in Altnagelvin informed us that it doesn’t normally travel upwards.  \r\nWe feel as a family we have been badly let down and mistreated from the very beginning and now my younger brother has only got a short time left. We as a family are furious as we feel this could have been different. We are disgusted at how he has been treated and we do not want this to happen to another person or their family.

Initially, speech and therapy sessions were the hardest for my wife, but Margaret was so calm, and clear in explaining everything. We can now have a good conversation and know what to do when things are tricky.  \r\nAfter almost 2 months in hospital the physio, and approach was entirely different, it was all geared to the future and getting her ready for daily life. Looking back her progress has been significant. I remember that it was me who initially noticed a movement in one of her fingers in the ward after 40 days – that sparked quite a bit of physio activity. The changes at home have been daily, weekly and ongoing.  \r\nWe have had a pattern of an average of 3 physio sessions a week, largely due to Tracey coming twice a week when she is available. Often the lead physio Helen, is supported by Emma or Leanne. We have always been able to talk progress through with any of the team, that has been a feature of each visit we tend to have chat before the serious work starts, and often at the end, to clarify any points. All the members of the team are so easy to talk to and patient, when explaining to me in particular why I should be doing something.  \r\nI do not see how she could have had a better service, especially throughout this covid period. Helen went out of her way to come to our second Orthotics appointment, and was on hand when my wife decided she needed the toilet whilst they made adjustments to her splint. It went well and I believe that gave her confidence for the future use of disabled toilets. Helen offered to involve the carers in various elements of my wife's progress unfortunately for various reasons not always practical.  \r\nNow that we have the blue badge, and ramps we are mobile daily, and with the garage modifications and the rear ramps my wife can use the back garden. So a lot of thanks to Roanne.  \r\nI would recommend your team to anyone who needs you, you are all brilliant.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-09-12T12:09:30.53","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-09-15T11:56:24.333","readBy":[{"name":"Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust","count":3},{"name":"Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists (RCSLT)","count":1},{"name":"The Stroke Association","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/974410","id":"974410"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/974410/responses","id":"974410"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/974410/healthservices","id":"974410"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/974410/tags","id":"974410"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rha20-29202","id":"rha20-29202","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/advice","id":"advice"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/approach","id":"approach"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/assessments","id":"assessments"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/clarity","id":"clarity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/community%20rehabilitation","id":"community rehabilitation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/conversation","id":"Conversation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disability","id":"disability"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/easy%20to%20talk%20to","id":"easy to talk to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/great%20service","id":"great service"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/home%20visits","id":"home visits"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/occupational%20therapist","id":"occupational therapist"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/orthotics","id":"orthotics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/physiotherapist","id":"physiotherapist"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/progress","id":"Progress"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/recommend","id":"recommend"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/speech%20and%20language","id":"Speech and Language"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stroke","id":"stroke"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/therapist","id":"therapist"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/therapy","id":"therapy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/walking%20aid","id":"walking aid"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/calm","id":"calm"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/impressive","id":"impressive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassuring","id":"reassuring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disabled%20toilet","id":"disabled toilet"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/explanations","id":"explanations"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/occupational%20health","id":"occupational health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/chat","id":"chat"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/prompt%20action","id":"prompt action"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/brilliant%20team","id":"brilliant team"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disability%20access","id":"disability access"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/974913","id":"974913"}]},{"id":974412,"author":"pictorjc64","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Appointment Letter","body":"I received a letter dated the 5th to let me know about an appointment on the 4th.

I had not noticed this. I was then admitted to ward 42 at the Victoria.  \r\nThe treatment at ward 42 was very good. I was made feel welcome, I couldn’t fault them. I received 3 MRI scans whilst in the VHK. Physiotherapy was very difficult at first. I was then transferred to Letham Ward Cameron Hospital for further Rehabilitation.  \r\nWhilst at Cameron there was nodules found on my spine, all communications to the Western General was dealt with quickly. Physiotherapy very challenging.  \r\nI became frustrated and angry at the beginning, now I understand why Physiotherapy did what they did. Activities helped me a lot , I enjoyed working on the jigsaws and the hand physio box that the Activities coordinator made for me. Also I enjoyed sudoku and crosswords for activities.  \r\nThe first bed was a little high for me, this was corrected very quickly . Meal choices became very repetitive after being here for many months.  \r\nI cannot fault the staff at Letham ward, whatever I needed I got. I have had a lot of trouble with the diabetic team at the VHK, it has has taken months for my monitor etc to be sorted.  \r\nI am where I am today with my Rehab because of the Staff at Letham

I was constructing wooden storage cupboards which involved power tools. Unexpectedly a circular saw I was using kicked back out of a piece of timber and landed on my left arm between my thumb and index finger before running up my wrist approximately six inches. I immediately knew I had a serious injury. Using my right hand I immediately grasped the wound in order to stem blood loss. I ran outside to my work van, where my phone was. Fortunately the 'Emergency Call Only' icon appeared on the phone screen as I struggled to call for assistance. The Operator who received my call was great. She established my identity, location and extent of my injury and continued to reassure me. She quickly identified that the air ambulance would be the best first response. The operator remained on the line as other agencies were tasked and continued to reassure me and seek information. I do not know this lady's name but I would like to thank her for all she did. I was able to tell her when I could hear the helicopter. As the helicopter landed I could hear other sirens approach. I felt so relieved to hear these sounds. The Air Ambulance crew, paramedics and police officers all seemed to arrive within a short period of time. A police officer positioned himself to my side as I was assisted to the ground. I remember him applying pressure to the inside of my upper arm in order to restrict blood loss. I am very grateful to this officer who acted quickly. The Air Ambulance consultant (I think his name was Darren) immediately reassured me. He was the consummate professional. Calm, decisive, knowledgeable. He directed paramedic staff to apply a loose tourniquet and to remove my hand from my wound and apply bandage. I was removed to the paramedics' ambulance where the Consultant directed I be put on a drip and given morphine. He then instructed the ambulance crew to take me to The Ulster Hospital for the attention of the Plastics Dept. I would like to thank the Air Ambulance crew for both their rapid response and the expert medical treatment.  \r\nThe paramedic staff (Sharon and David I believe) who transported me to the Ulster Hospital were great. Sharon monitored my condition continually and reassured me. She was so kind. I would like to thank both these staff for their assistance.  \r\nOn arrival at the Ulster Hospital I received prompt attention. I was seen by numerous doctors and nurses all of who were wonderful. After assessment I was told I needed an operation which would probably be done the next day. I was consulted about whether I wanted to stay overnight in hospital or return home. I chose the latter. My wound was temporarily stitched and dressed before discharge.  \r\nThe following morning I returned to the Plastics Dept in the Ulster Hospital. I was admitted. I was allocated a room. This was amazing. My room was like a hotel with en suite toilet facilities, TV and remotely controlled lights and blinds. Incredible. In the evening I was taken to theatre. The staff where amazing. The reassured me and we joked light-heartedly. I felt safe in their hands. At midnight I awoke. I felt no pain. I felt very happy with everything. The following day the Consultant surgeon visited me with his entourage. He told me he had reconnected tendons, arteries and nerves and that all was well. I believe his name was Andrew. I would like to thank Andrew for his assistance and his excellent stitching. I can tell he tried to make good the mess I had made of my tattoos. The scarring will be minimal. The nursing staff on the ward were I recovered from the operation were so nice. I would like to thank them all. I would also like to thank the man who brought my food to me. He was courteous and friendly. A special mention to the male cleaner who sorted my room. He was a middle aged man and he made me laugh. I really liked him. Thank you Sir.  \r\nAfter discharge from the ward I have attended the Hand clinic on several occasions. Once again I would like to thank the staff. I was seen by Tom on the first two occasions. Great at his job and super friendly. Janey, the consultant hand specialist, was so knowledgeable and gave me great insight into the nature of my injury and the rationale behind the physio programme. Janet was also brilliant. She gave me a detailed physio programme and also the confidence to follow it.  \r\nMy treatment is ongoing but I would like to put on record that I believe the treatment and care I have received from first point of contact with the telephone operator to date as not only been first class, but world class.

CAMHS experience","body":"I initially got refereed to CAMHS when I was 12 for what was thought to be just anxiety and depression as diagnosed by the doctor.  \r\nI was on the waiting list for 2 years, tried multiple ineffective therapists outwith the NHS, and my condition got a lot worse with the anxious and depressive symptoms. I initially got contacted by them in mid 2019 and turned it down because they didn't seem like they cared because of the long wait and no contact so how were they going to help?My mental health got a lot worse later in 2020 so the doctor referred me back to CAMHS again and we got an initial appointment to discuss what's going on followed by a few others with different doctors to discuss the same thing. It was sickeningly repetitive and felt like a dead end. My mental health continued to significantly worsen as 2021 rolled by with suicidal thoughts creeping in. I had another few repetitive appointments then I got booked in with online therapy as part of CAMHS. I found that it was quite useless, patronizing, being treated like a small child and again the same repetitive one size fits all thing I've seen within CAMHS.I then inquired about testing for autism as I felt I fit the criteria after my own research. I also inquired about medication for depression. This was about mid 2021. They put me on the autism test waiting list and medicine review waiting list, by this point I was pretty used to what felt like endless months of waiting between appointments.Near the end of 2021 was when I hit a crisis point and was suicidal. It felt like nobody could help me. We then got booked in with CAMHS again after my doctor insisted I have an appointment.It felt like in order for me to get any help from CAMHS I had to hit a point of being suicidal. I thought I was going in for a medication review and had a tiny spark of hope that something might help that was quickly crushed when I found out it was a risk assessment and I had to tell this new person the same thing I had told what felt like hundreds of doctors. I was frustrated with the lack of clarity about the appointments purpose.I was told I was also going to be starting autism testing in December 2021 with yet another new person. I started the autism testing with in person sessions again telling the same things about my mental health I had told lots of other professionals. Why couldn't they just share notes? I then got handed lots of questionnaires to complete. I then had a couple of other in person appointments then was told I would have another new person to do the diagnosis which really frustrated me. I met the new person early 2022 at a different location from my usual appointments which I didn't like. It still had the CAMHS usual young children orientated stuff which was patronising and I think a lot of older children and teens would think too. There should be a mix of decoration and things for younger and older patients in the CAMHS areas. They then got a psychiatrist in to see me to review getting medication. I got to meet the psychiatrist prior to the official review in a session with both of them which was nice.I went in for lots of appointments that felt a bit unnecessary with the new autism test staff. I had some other sessions with them and the psychiatrist to both confirm the autism and review medication for the depression which all felt like the multiple CAMHS appointments I'd been going to for years, telling the same stories about my mental health.In mid 2022 again and hit another crisis point. We sped up the medication review process and I finally got cleared for anti depressants August 2022 and started them. The anti depressents so far have helped. I then got officially diagnosed with autism September 2022 which helped answer a lot of questions and explained a lot of things about myself that I was unaware was autism. It was the things that ran deeper than the previously diagnosed anxiety an depression. I had felt like a broken human my whole life and now I realise I'm just wired differently.Unfortunately a late autism diagnosis is very common in women even though it would have helped me so much when I was younger and not think I'm just bad at being a person. It is important that we see the differences in autism within different genders at different ages and recognise and embrace them instead of dismissal.It's bittersweet I was one of the lucky people that got seen as I know the waiting list of thousands of people is overflowing and it's frustrating. Young people's mental health is at a crisis point and nobody seems to care until they're suicidal or dead with not enoulgh being done to prevent it. They're always being told it'll get better eventually, or that it's just hormones, which is mostly not the case and harmful to be told especially when there could be mental illness hiding in the darkness. CAMHS need to find a better system that works. Perhaps like having initial phone appointments with patients and streamlining them into areas such as anxiety help, autism diagnosis, depression help etc. Then being given out packs by post or email with resources to help cope with the areas of struggle (established during the initial call) between the first and future appointments. Also resources for parents to help understand and support their children in these packs. This would help tremendously even with the situation now until something else is sorted and added to this to get people seen and supported.","criticality":"moderately

Breastfeeding Support Team available is a necessity for new mums (and I’m sure second/third and more time mums!) who benefit hugely from the skills and expertise of the team.  \r\nAs a new mum I felt supported by the team on numerous occasions where Kelly helped to support me through mastitis, nipple shields, position and latch, and much more.  \r\nI am in complete support of the Breastfeeding Team and the inspiring role they play in a mother's breastfeeding journey. In support of the team, I wish to say that this is a key area of need and if we wish as a society to encourage new mothers to breastfeed. In my view, this service needs to be supported further financially and more staff added to the exceptional team in place just now.  \r\nBreastfeeding is magical and such an important part of being a mother. However, we live in a society where often as a breastfeeding mother, you are in the minority. This means support is even more important and I cannot thank the Breastfeeding Team enough for helping me with my breastfeeding journey.  \r\nMy baby is now 10 months old and is exclusively breastfed despite several initial challenges I faced. I am very proud of this and I cannot thank the team enough for being so wonderfully supportive.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-09-13T15:10:58.36","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-09-16T11:02:24.107","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Fife","count":6},{"name":"Fife Health & Social Care Partnership","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/974566","id":"974566"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/974566/responses","id":"974566"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/974566/healthservices","id":"974566"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/974566/tags","id":"974566"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sf9-breast-feeding","id":"sf9-breast-feeding","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/advice","id":"advice"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breastfeeding","id":"breastfeeding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breastfeeding%20support","id":"Breastfeeding Support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/expertise","id":"expertise"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/level%20of%20care","id":"level of care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/listening","id":"listening"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mastitis","id":"mastitis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/proud","id":"proud"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported","id":"supported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thankful","id":"Thankful"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/974926","id":"974926"}]},{"id":973183,"author":"Markz95","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Lack of access to NHS24","body":"I called NHS 24 about my daughters worsening back pain, however after 90 minutes I was getting nowhere & she was crying in pain.

I was admitted to A&E, and they were brilliant. Moved to SAU, and the day staff were very good, the night staff not so good but acceptable.  \r\nThe problem started when I was transferred to Surgical Assessment Ward. The day staff were very good, but after being in the ward overnight with the air con going 24/7, I was stressed and crying. One of the nurses calmed me down, as I was ready to discharge myself. That was the first time anything was explained to me by the nurse, and then the night staff came on and were not interested. Patients were buzzing in, but they would come and put the buzzer off but not come back.  \r\nI couldn't sleep and asked for a hot drink. It never came, so I went for a walk to find one. When I did, I sat and drank it at the vending machine and fell asleep. 3 hours later I went back to the ward, passed the nurses station, and never got a look. I was feeling better and my wife and daughter convinced me to stay, but it was very stressful and hope the next time will be better.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-09-12T17:05:07.9633333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-09-16T11:14:20.917","readBy":[{"name":"United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust","count":17}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/974483","id":"974483"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/974483/responses","id":"974483"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/974483/healthservices","id":"974483"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/974483/tags","id":"974483"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rwdda_100","id":"RWDDA_100","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rwdda_180","id":"RWDDA_180","score":3},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/a&e","id":"a&e"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/a&e%20staff","id":"A&E staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stressful","id":"stressful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgical%20assessment%20unit","id":"surgical assessment unit"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/a&e%20care","id":"A&E care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/explanations","id":"explanations"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/infections","id":"infections"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disinterested%20staff","id":"disinterested staff"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/975365","id":"975365"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/975400","id":"975400"}]},{"id":974487,"author":"Spike1","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Very well looked after all round","body":"Had a procedure as soon as I arrived at hospital and then the after care was excellent.

The appointment will be 18 weeks after initial referral! 18 weeks is a normal referral not an urgent one.  \r\nI have contacted the patient experience team who were very pleasant and understanding and have lodged my complaint. However, this may take over 20 working days. Although this is being taken forward, my health has taken further deterioration and I am extremely frustrated at this point. Thus, I feel a need to share this publicly to raise awareness to the public and wider NHS services.  \r\nI undestand the strains that are on the NHS right now however, this is incomprehensible. According to the Scottish government guidance on urgent referrals (2021) patients should not have to wait for 18 weeks.  \r\nI am aware that I only moved 1 position on the waiting list in 11 days. That seems quite absurd for an urgent referral.  \r\nI am struggling to function most days due to extreme exhaustion and have lost more weight since I was referred. My GP practice informed me that it is out of their hands once they have made the referral.  \r\nI have had no information from any health professional about the delay. Is this not an inhumane way of treating people?  \r\nMy swollen lymph nodes may be attributed to stress, according to what I have read. I do hope this is the case however, this unexplained delay certainly doesn't help to reduce my stress levels.  \r\nAccording to my socioeconomic and demographic background the Scottish government highlights the increased likelihood of health issues and a need for NHS to take this into consideration. I certainly don't feel my needs, (whether my swollen lymph nodes are related to stress or disease) are being considered in any way whatsoever.  \r\nI notice a lot of responses for Lothian seems to be written by the patient experience team. I would be grateful to know if this story also goes to the department it's related to.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-09-10T18:45:53.5933333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-09-16T11:24:48.067","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lothian","count":7}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/974285","id":"974285"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/974285/responses","id":"974285"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/974285/healthservices","id":"974285"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/974285/tags","id":"974285"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/s308h_120","id":"S308H_120","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frustrated","id":"frustrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ent","id":"ent"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lump","id":"lump"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lymph%20nodes","id":"lymph nodes"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/patient%20experience%20team","id":"Patient Experience Team"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting%20time","id":"waiting time"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/weight","id":"weight"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/delays","id":"delays"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/exhaustion","id":"exhaustion"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/982424","id":"982424"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/983389","id":"983389"}]},{"id":974572,"author":"MrsA","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"The care and support we received was absolutely amazing","body":"We had a visit to PCMU a few weeks before the arrival of our little one, and felt really happy with the tour and information we were given - we knew it was the right place for us to meet our baby.  \r\nWhen I went into labour, we called the unit and they put my mind at rest, explaining what was to come. Things moved quickly, and we ended up heading to the unit earlier than expected. We were met by a midwife and student midwife who checked me over, prepared the birthing pool and explained things to my husband and me. The care and support we received was absolutely amazing, and I feel so lucky to have been able to give birth with amazing women helping me.  \r\nWe were given special time with our newborn, and never felt rushed - the staff were very sensitive and considerate. When I was moved to the post natal room, we were looked after for the two nights my baby and I spent there, and everyone we met made it feel like such a homely place.  \r\nWe were very well looked after and I would highly recommend anyone to come here to have their babies.

From his initial assessment in SATA he was then admitted to ARU 5 for 24hrs before finally being admitted to Ward 7B, where he is still a patient.  \r\nThe care he has received in all has been exceptional, all of these units were extremely busy but they still found time to keep my mum updated . SATA provided him with the essential cups of tea and biscuits he needed to keep him going, and were so thorough in their investigations they can’t be faulted.  \r\nARU 5 updated my mum in in the morning when she called regarding how he was overnight, and 7B again have been fantastic putting him at his ease as he’s never been in hospital before in his 80 yrs, and if possible they let my mum speak to him on the phone most mornings.  \r\nOn top of all this, the medical care he’s received has been second to none, what a great job you all do. Hopefully he will be home soon, but all these little touches make such a difference, especially to the patient but also to the families that are worrying at home .  \r\nKeep up the fantastic work you do.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-09-13T19:26:37.5066667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-09-16T12:56:23.59","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":6}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/974593","id":"974593"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/974593/responses","id":"974593"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/974593/healthservices","id":"974593"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/974593/tags","id":"974593"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sj9qe-304","id":"sj9qe-304","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sj9-south-glasgow-hospital-aru","id":"SJ9-south-glasgow-hospital-aru","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sj9-south-glasgow-hospital-sata","id":"SJ9-south-glasgow-hospital-sata","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/chest%20x-ray","id":"chest x-ray"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ct%20scan","id":"CT scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/level%20of%20care","id":"level of care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pneumonia","id":"pneumonia"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thorough","id":"thorough"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thankful","id":"Thankful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/initially%20worried","id":"initially worried"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/975410","id":"975410"}]},{"id":974836,"author":"plutocz95","authorRoleId":3,"authorRole":"a parent/guardian","title":"The staff were amazing and so helpful","body":"My daughters were in an RTC and brought to DHH Emergency Department.

During his inpatient stay within Ward B7 he was treated with absolute dignity and respect and as a family we were included in every decision, taking time to explain his treatment plan often on more than one occasion if we hadn’t processed all the information.  \r\nWhilst undergoing chemo he also had to manage his Type 1 diabetes alongside his Asperger’s, and as a family we were supported in our suggestion to have someone stay with him overnight to ensure his BMs were checked regularly and acted upon accordingly; although I have no doubt the nursing staff would happily have done this. The staff recognised his individual needs and without a doubt his care was patient-centred and tailored to his needs.  \r\nThe emotional support we received from Julie was fantastic. She always gave as much time as was needed to allow us to talk and ask questions. She was honest regarding the treatment and the impact this would be likely to have on him both physically and emotionally, however ensured the support was there when needed.  \r\nAs it stands he has completed his chemo, undergone surgery and beginning to look at his maintenance care, but most importantly he’s looking forward to enjoying life to its fullest.  \r\nThank you to Dr White, Julie, and all the nursing, domestic and healthcare assistants, alongside anyone else involved in his care.

Overall, I found all staff polite and helpful. The staff did not always get things right first time (minor issues), however it was heartening that they made sure to involve me in decision making throughout my time in their care. Everyone from porters, nurses, doctors and consultants were attentive, though Kevin displayed exceptional willingness to make sure the service received was great.  \r\nImportantly, I was not rushed or hassled at any point in my stay, which helped me both mentally, physically and emotionally.  \r\nThank you one and all, with a special thank you to Kevin😁","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-09-13T20:42:01.6066667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-09-16T13:31:54.343","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Tayside","count":4}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/974598","id":"974598"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/974598/responses","id":"974598"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/974598/healthservices","id":"974598"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/974598/tags","id":"974598"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/t101h-coronary-care","id":"t101h-coronary-care","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/attentive","id":"attentive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cardiac","id":"cardiac"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cardiac%20arrest","id":"cardiac arrest"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ccu","id":"ccu"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/explanation","id":"explanation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helpful","id":"helpful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/polite","id":"polite"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thankful","id":"Thankful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/one%20to%20one%20work","id":"one to one work"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/heart%20mri","id":"heart mri"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/listened%20to","id":"listened to"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/974982","id":"974982"}]},{"id":974284,"author":"sigmabq58","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"My short hospital visit","body":"I was collected by ambulance from home to Treliske hospital and I spent the next 12/13 hours in the back of 2 different ambulances (after a shift change).

There was Ben from (RATS) Rapid Access and Treatment Service, who sang his way softly through all my procedures, knowing all the words to the songs playing quietly in the background. The first lovely voice I heard. I must mention the nurses in the Discharge lounge who, when I was left on my own to wait to be picked up, gave me a couple of Beatle songs. Lovely voices too!

Triaged just after midnight where I was taken through to department, given oral painkillers and left on a chair. That chair would be where I sat for 7+Hours before a doctor would see me. During which time, despite active bleeding my blood pressure was not taken, I feel like staff went out there way to not look at me. I was sitting next to 2 elderly inpatients, 1 of which asked for pain relief 3 times, ended up getting paracetamol from another patient. They were in the department 12+ hours however some intoxicated patients given beds.  \r\nI was reviewed by doctor in treatment room, and was told I could rest on the trolley. I asked for painkillers and blanket and had to go look for this 1 hour later. Then put back in Chair for 2-3 hours.  \r\nI was then told I was going to get a bed up in ward B12 SAU, on arrival to that ward, myself and 3 other A&E patients were left in corridor of ward on chair, one patient being sick in floor, as the ward was full with no beds.  \r\nThe emergency department made me feel worthless, like I was just another hindrance, I’ve never been so upset with the treatment not only me, but others received.  \r\nIn B12 there was lovely staff who despite not having beds, reassured us, empathised and done what they could and were so attentive despite high demands.  \r\nI basically felt like I was in a cattle market in A&E and, as a nurse myself with years of A&E experience, I was embarrassed and ashamed.

She was initially seen at Antrim Area Hospital, who then transferred her to The Royal Victoria Hospital (RVH) for surgery. Care at the RVH was fine. My Father who is now extremely hard of hearing had been accompanied by either my sister, or myself so that we could help him understand anything that was said or answer any medical questions posed by staff. This was acceptable at both Antrim and RVH.  \r\nUpon transfer to Musgrave Park Hospital this changed. Senior staff refused to allow this to happen, despite us explaining the situation. As I had arrived with my father on the first visit we were told that on this occasion only both could see her, but it would be for a reduced time 30mins, instead of 60mins.  \r\nOn entering the ward I allowed my father to go to my mothers bed, while I spoke to a nurse to check on her care and make sure they had all relevant information.  \r\nSo this is were it all starts to go down hill.  \r\nFirstly, the RVH hadn’t informed them of my mother being lactose intolerant. If given dairy products she will get severe migraine and diarrhoea. The nurse apologised saying she had already given her some ice cream as she hadn’t been eating or drinking for at least 72hrs prior to being transferred. She added the lactose intolerance information to the medical notes for future reference.  \r\nSo now the fun begins. My father has to pre-book 1 hour visits, but now only he can visit. Every day either myself or my sister would make 1 phone call to check in with ward as my father can’t hear and therefore can’t tell us much.  \r\nOn three occasions this week, after being informed of her lactose intolerance, they have said they fed her ice-cream. This has resulted in diarrhoea, which with her not drinking properly is not helping her fluid levels. They have a sign over her bed about lactose intolerance and still they give her dairy products.  \r\nAll in all, what with her dementia, extreme confusion, recent surgery etc. this is a totally unacceptable level of care from so called health professionals.","criticality":"strongly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-09-03T17:20:54.2566667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-09-16T14:07:40.01","readBy":[{"name":"Ulster University, MBBS (Medicine) 2021","count":3},{"name":"Belfast Health and Social Care Trust","count":10}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/972373","id":"972373"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/972373/responses","id":"972373"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/972373/healthservices","id":"972373"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/972373/tags","id":"972373"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt001_03021_110","id":"ZT001_03021_110","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt001_11021_100","id":"ZT001_11021_100","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/apology","id":"apology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confusion","id":"confusion"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dementia","id":"dementia"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diarrhoea","id":"diarrhoea"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fell","id":"fell"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hard%20of%20hearing","id":"hard of hearing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hip","id":"hip"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lack%20of%20communication","id":"Lack of communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lactose%20intolerance","id":"lactose intolerance"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/level%20of%20care","id":"level of care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unacceptable","id":"unacceptable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/visiting","id":"visiting"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ice%20cream","id":"ice cream"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/attention%20to%20medical%20notes","id":"attention to medical notes"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/974962","id":"974962"}]},{"id":974662,"author":"RobTom","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Interventional Radiology at Victoria Hospital Kirkaldy","body":"I had a Hickman line put in by the team at Victoria Hospital today.

We came to the Children's hospital through A&E where the nurses and doctors took a vigilant approach to his symptoms. At the time it could have been dismissed as a viral infection however the view was cautious and we were subsequently moved to 2c.  \r\nWe were there for a number of days where the diagnosis came within 12 hours of testing. He was difficult to cannulate and keep cannulated however his wellbeing was their upmost concern. The teams did everything possible to keep him comfortable and following several failed cannulas, they took him to theatre late on the Friday night to put in a long line. Naturally, I was hyper cautious about his temperature and any small sign he might be deteriorating but the teams were really kind and patient.  \r\nThey worked hard to keep us as parents reassured, and comfortable as well. We were then moved to 3c ortho for further care and again, the teams couldn't do enough for our son, or us. His long line failed after 2 days but the teams suggested a process that would keep his next canula viable and it did. We were apprehensive about brining him home ahead of the initial 14 days that had been suggested. The teams were understanding and offered us extra days and took time to explain the process to us and that he was well enough to come home. We never felt any pressure that they needed the bed, quite the opposite. We really can't thank the teams enough for their diligence, professionalism, kindness and patience during one of the most stressful times of our lives. We are so blessed to have the NHS and the people who dedicate their lives to the service. A days work for them, meant the world to us and now we have our health baby boy home.  \r\nIn terms of the other services you don't necessarily think of, the room we were in was kept really clean, we were fed every day and we went to the medi-cinema which was great for our older son to come and see his brother in a less scary environment. The park outside is great for some air, we were able to take him out in his pram a number of times. The is a night cafe which was weirdly nice to be able to do when I couldn't sleep - it was just somewhere to go. The shower was also surprisingly good.  \r\n[Very happy with 'Treatment']  \r\n  \r\n[Very happy with 'Involved in decisions']","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-09-13T18:40:49.17","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-09-16T14:36:48.027","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":12},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2022)","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/974586","id":"974586"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/974586/responses","id":"974586"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/974586/healthservices","id":"974586"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/974586/tags","id":"974586"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sj9-children-accident-emergency","id":"sj9-children-accident-emergency","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sj9-children-acu","id":"sj9-children-ACU","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sj9-children-renal","id":"sj9-children-renal","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood","id":"blood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cleanliness","id":"cleanliness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diagnosis","id":"diagnosis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/food","id":"food"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/infection","id":"infection"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professionalism","id":"professionalism"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/room","id":"room"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/safe","id":"safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/showers","id":"showers"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/temperature","id":"temperature"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thoroughness","id":"thoroughness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/viral%20infection","id":"viral infection"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/patience","id":"patience"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thankful","id":"Thankful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/access%20to%20refreshments","id":"access to refreshments"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/clear%20explanations","id":"clear explanations"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/service","id":"service"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/975060","id":"975060"}]},{"id":974642,"author":"Bernie58","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Felt comfortable and well looked after for skin biopsy","body":"I was treated and looked after by Miss Tyers, Fiona and Clare.

Thanks to everyone for their care.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-09-14T08:29:16.1833333","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2022-09-16T14:44:17.07","readBy":[{"name":"Belfast Health and Social Care Trust","count":6}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/974614","id":"974614"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/974614/responses","id":"974614"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/974614/healthservices","id":"974614"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/974614/tags","id":"974614"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt001_03021","id":"ZT001_03021","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/caring","id":"caring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cleanliness","id":"cleanliness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hand%20surgery","id":"hand surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurse","id":"nurse"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professional","id":"professional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20ease","id":"at ease"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nothing%20too%20much%20trouble","id":"nothing too much trouble"}]}]
