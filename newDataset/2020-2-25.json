I can honestly say I'm  so impressed with Riverside medical centre, When I phone for an appointment I or my family are seen the same day when its urgent, I have never struggled to get an appointment &amp; when I am seen the doctors are on time too, no long waiting times like I've previously experienced. Each doctor I have seen are extremely professional &amp; do everything in their power to diagnose the problem. I cannot fault the surgery at all. The receptionists are polite &amp; friendly, not intrusive or rude which I've previously experienced in previous surgeries. The dispensary staff cannot do enough for you,  they are so kind &amp; friendly &amp; remember your name too! I recently requested a repeat prescription online on the same morning as I saw the doctor &amp; when I went to the dispensary it was ready &amp; waiting! They knew when I was due to run out of my tablets &amp; repeated the prescription automatically, I was so impressed at their excellent patient service throughout &amp; I would highly recommend Riverside medical centre.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2019-10-07T16:29:29","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-02-25T08:29:30","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/744600","id":"744600"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/744600/responses","id":"744600"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/744600/healthservices","id":"744600"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/744600/tags","id":"744600"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/p81185","id":"P81185","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diagnose","id":"diagnose"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/impressed","id":"impressed"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/744915","id":"744915"}]},{"id":744606,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Need to change the culture and put patients at…","body":"Patient experience doesn’t appear to be high on the priority list at this practice.\nThere is a lack of insight into what it feels like to be a patient on the receiving end of care, from the minute you step into the building. The clinical care is usually good when you get in front of a professional, but the booking process, communication and experience could be better.\nHard working staff can be cold, defensive, unfriendly and at times rude; my good morning greeting after  digital checkin was met with an uncomfortable stare and silence by staff at the front desk. High quality patient care doesn’t just mean good outcomes, it has to be safe and the experience matters too. On my recent visit I waited 45 mins over my appointment time. There was no acknowledgement or apology, no communication to inform me the Dr was running late, indignation and a lack of eye contact when I dared to approach the desk to ask when I might be seen. \nClearly the service is under huge pressure as demand continually increases, but losing sight of the patient/customer experience undermines quality. This practice is a merger melting pot, but the culture that needs to evolve is one of compassion, caring and kindness. Leaders set the tone and it is down to the leadership to help create the climate to allow the practice  and it’s team to flourish. This is a fantastic facility but it could be so much better - listen and learn from the reviews, they speak for themselves. Reviewer anonymity isn’t a reason to do nothing. Managers need to take a good look at the organisation and make a concerted effort to make a change. It’s really that simple.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-02-24T14:13:22","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-02-25T09:05:24","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Leeds ICB","count":2}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/744606","id":"744606"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/744606/responses","id":"744606"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/744606/healthservices","id":"744606"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/744606/tags","id":"744606"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/b86008","id":"B86008","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/eye","id":"eye"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good","id":"good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/safe","id":"safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sight","id":"sight"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/uncomfortable","id":"uncomfortable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fantastic","id":"fantastic"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/769894","id":"769894"}]},{"id":744605,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Great Practice","body":"Very happy with this practice - always helpful.

All these cancellations by the hospital, while my daughters eczema is getting to the worst it has ever been.  We then received a letter asking if we still needed the appointment....which was rescheduled to 11th February 20.  With less than 2 weeks to the appointment date, the appointment was cancelled and rescheduled to the Brentwood Community Hospital for the 8th February 20, which was good.  Only that they can only provide temporary measures (steroid tablets), even though my daughter said to the consultant that she gets rebound effects from using this medication each time it has been prescribed, so she was not keen on taking them.  Now we have to wait even longer to get an appointment with Basildon hospital...as the community hospital can only do so much, she needs care from the hospital.

After struggling to contact the Gynecology reception for a few days finally I managed to speak with the receptionist and explained that I had a follow-up appointment for a surgery which was not scheduled and asked him to check what had gone wrong. He was extremely rude and refused to help at all saying that this was not his job even though in the letter which I received from the hospital I was instructed to contact the reception on exactly that phone number if I have any issues with the surgery appointment. I then went to my GP and asked them to contact the hospital which they did but it has been almost a month since then and still no surgery appointment. Today I tried to contact the reception again but this time the receptionist just said to hold on a minute, I waited for 20 min on the phone and he did not respond. Then I tried to contact the reception again a few times through the day and every time my call was redirected to voice mail.

Arrived onto the unit, gave my name and they were expecting me, sat in waiting area for around 30 minutes, watched Phillip & Holly make a chicken curry on This Morning on the TV and was then called in for triage. Bloods taken & obs done, ultrasound booked. Left unit to go get some lunch and given a pager. Whilst eating the lunch upstairs in the canteen the pager sounded, back to A1 where porters were waiting. Taken to Radiology, Ultrasound done straight away - advised no blood clot. Back to A1, another short wait (less than 20 mins) to watch a bit of Judge Rinder then Consultant called me in. \nNo DVT, diagnosed as a complication of a pre-existing problem. Although the issue cannot have been resolved today by Ambulatory Care/A&E the care and attention I was provided with was excellent. I was given a prescription for some different medications, advice, reassurance and sent on my way. \n\nConsultant also gave me a letter to help fast track some appointments already had in the pipeline. Got home called secretarial team and appointment made for next week. \n\nVery impressed with the care and “service” I received today. I couldn’t have asked for better treatment. Every member of staff I saw was thorough, very friendly and caring. I have a complex medical history and a bit of a journey ahead (slight understatement) and my coping mechanism is to joke and act about, the staff recognised this and obliged in joining me in my humour. They were patient, understanding of my concerns and appeared to genuinely care, if today was anything to go by then I’m in good hands for my future journey. \n\nThe NHS takes a lot of criticism regularly, it’s only right that when things go well that we take the time to feed that back. \n\nWell done everyone and thank you.

Now 10pm, second call back to say sorry for the delay. As mentioned in original call, overtired due to lack of sleep due to itching of spots (came up overnight). Rang 111 as worried about risk to other people. Spots have since increased. Each call 111 asked me: Do you feel worse or have your symptoms got worse? The honest answer is no. However, I'm covered in more spots than before and doesn't alleviate my worries regarding my condition. Which is obviously a fustration. The challenge is in feeling worse vs. having worse symptoms. I'm very tired as I didn't sleep well last night due to the original complaint i.e lots of red spots which woke up me up due to the itching. The difficulty is when you're balancing working because you need to (self employed) vs. worried about other peoples health. 111 has probed to be no use to be. I can appreciate the delays myself and many others are experiencing due to the present pressures to the service (i.e coronavirus). I would suggest more funding to resource the needs to those wishing to engage with the service. This would save the NHS time and money, as would reduce the attendance at A and E and GP practice. If this service is expected to be of benefit, it must have enough resources to respond to those who are reaching out for help, and if isn't to fulfil this criteria, and in turn give useful advice, must ask itself, what function does this serve. My experience could be an isolated indecent. However, I would implore a review in the service. My experience would show a common mentality amongst those whom are self employed. Without the benefits of sick pay, you have little to no choice but to work. I have the utmost respect for the NHs service, so do not look to criticise. Just wish to improve the system, as the 111 service is unable to meet the needs of those wishing to access it. Those of genuine health concerns, following an experience of mine, would not be willing to use this service again.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-02-24T23:06:03","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2020-02-25T09:49:02","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/744635","id":"744635"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/744635/responses","id":"744635"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/744635/healthservices","id":"744635"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/744635/tags","id":"744635"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/ntp","id":"NTP","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/isolated","id":"isolated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/worried","id":"worried"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lack%20of%20sleep","id":"lack of sleep"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20worried","id":"not worried"}]},{"id":744634,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Grateful patient","body":"I was admitted on 19/2/2020 with my fourth heart attack, The team were very professional and worked in a confidence inspiring way, Each one making sure I felt in great hands all the way they put right my problems, The consultant though being brought in as he was going to bed was very pleasant and even found the time for a little chat as they prepared me for the ward.\nThe fantastic care was continued in the Coronary care unit through to my discharge home, A highly skilled and caring set of staff from start to finish, Although nobody wants to be in this situation, I couldn't have possibly asked for better treatment, Well done and a massive thank you to all involved from me and my family.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-02-25T00:58:19","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2020-02-25T09:53:29","readBy":[{"name":"Blackpool Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/744634","id":"744634"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/744634/responses","id":"744634"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/744634/healthservices","id":"744634"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/744634/tags","id":"744634"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rxl01","id":"RXL01","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/coronary","id":"coronary"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/coronary%20care","id":"coronary care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/heart","id":"heart"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/heart%20attack","id":"heart attack"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confidence","id":"confidence"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fantastic","id":"fantastic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/no%20confidence","id":"no confidence"}]},{"id":744636,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Nice environment!","body":"My appointment was on time.

GP surgery","body":"I've tried to book an appointment for the past 3 days, ring at 8am and then wait 30min to then be told that they have no appointments. I ended up in A&E because things took such a bad turn with my mental health due to the severe pain I was experiencing. Again, was told to go back to my GP practice. The receptionists are some of the most rudest individuals I ever had to encounter. Once I had begged for an appointment, the receptionists became curt and very abrupt because they had no choice but to give me an appointment. They're so rude and have no empathy or skills to talk appropriately to service users. They never have any GPs in, instead they have advanced practitioners who cannot give sicknotes nor can they do referrals which means having to go in twice therefore wasting time and money. This company is owned by an American company so it's only obvious why they are rated so bad. They have also appeared on Yorkshire Evening Post as one of the worst GP surgeries. I have also put in a review and they sent me a reply saying I had written this in capital letters which is deemed as shouting. Which was a complete lie. I did not write in capital letters at all and will take this further as they are not publishing real reviews of how bad this surgery is. People should know who they are signing up with. Thank you.

During this period of time she has had to go to the Blackurn Royal hospital for various appointments.  Frequently there are excessive waiting times despite having a fixed appointment.  People don't seem to realise that they are dealing with extremely ill patients who are quite often experiencing severe pain.  There doesn't seem to be any compassion or concern at all. The effects of the chemotherapy are terrible.  My sister has had numerous painful infections and yet the requests for additional medication to ease pain and prevent further escalation is again another point for serious concern. My sister tells me that she feels like she is always having to beg for assistance.  Again I feel the need to emphasise that she is  extremely ill and needs to feel understood and cared for. She now has painful looking infections on both feet, making it difficult to wear shoes. She was told that she needs Betadine and yet for some inexplicable reason she is not receiving this medication.  Again another example of being ignored.  \nSomeone needs to take responsibility for the care of patients who are officially registered at this hospital in Blackburn. I fail to understand why this can be blamed on cut backs.  I always believed that doctors and nurses entered their respective professions because of their genuine desire to care for people.  I guess I must be more naive than I thought. \nSomething needs to drastically change in improving the quality of life of seriously ill cancer patients.

She eventually had Xrays there and was told she has severley impacted wisdom teeth and would need surgery to stop the pain.  Surviving on paracetamol for ages, she got an appointment for 6th of Feb and on arrival was told the consultant was off?  Would have thought a TXT would of been nice to say that before driving to the park and ride, but what was more annoying was they could not give her another date to see the consultant.  They said that they would contact her and tell her shortly.  No apology letter, no new appointment date.  She rang consultant secretary to be told they didnt know?   Long story short, pain getting worse daily, paracetemol no longer helping and she is in 9 out of 10 pain and after rining 111 etc as was after hours she ends up having to go to A&E.  They gave prescription meds which help, but still is continually getting worse and they said she need surgery to remove them asap.  She went back to consultant secretary again who said they still have no rescheduled date, will let her know by end of Feb?  She explained been back to dentist, A&E and needs help sooner than later, but told she will have to wait till end of Feb for another date to see consultant? Back to dentist as pain getting worse and swelling, dentist prescribes anti biotics, says to chase consultant secretary, explain that she is in agony and needs urgent care.  Secretary says that still cant give a date, so it goes on.  Last night she came in from work and she couldnt speak she was in excrutiating pain, tried ice pack, hot water bottle etc, in end she had no choice to go back to A&E and get more prescribed pain killers!  So far its cost her more, the Hospital more and this will continue till these impacted wisdom teeth are surgically removed.  Maybe might be good to use the TXT appointment system to let patients know when appointments are cancelled too.  Any way in the meantime my daughter has to endure excrutiating pain, take heavy pain meds and there seems to be no other solution.  She and her partner have even seriously thought about taking her teeth out at home, as she really is at the end of her tether.  Hope it does not come to that.  \n","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-02-25T10:49:21","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-02-25T11:02:45","readBy":[{"name":"Royal Cornwall Hospitals NHS Trust","count":4}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/744669","id":"744669"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/744669/responses","id":"744669"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/744669/healthservices","id":"744669"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/744669/tags","id":"744669"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/ref12","id":"REF12","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good","id":"good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/impacted","id":"impacted"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/toothache","id":"toothache"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wisdom%20teeth","id":"wisdom teeth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hope","id":"Hope"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/745660","id":"745660"}]},{"id":744672,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Very friendly practice","body":"I have visited this practice many times over the last 50 years and have always found the staff friendly and helpful.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-02-25T10:59:36","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-02-25T11:03:12","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/744672","id":"744672"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/744672/responses","id":"744672"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/744672/healthservices","id":"744672"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/744672/tags","id":"744672"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/h85078","id":"H85078","score":null},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/778749","id":"778749"}]},{"id":744671,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Woeful","body":"This practice fails to communicate adequately with its patients.

This blanket ban will suit some patients but not all because the prevention is better than cure does not apply at AMG.\n\nAppointments to see GPs are not possible anymore unless we ring at 08:00 in the morning, if I ring too late, no matter what the urgency I have to call back the following morning.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-02-24T17:42:59","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2020-02-25T14:08:44","readBy":[{"name":"Healthwatch Tameside","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/744756","id":"744756"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/744756/responses","id":"744756"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/744756/healthservices","id":"744756"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/744756/tags","id":"744756"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/p89008","id":"P89008","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood","id":"blood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20test","id":"blood test"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20tests","id":"blood tests"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cholesterol","id":"cholesterol"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diabetic","id":"diabetic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/group","id":"group"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hba1c","id":"HBA1c"}]},{"id":744435,"author":"North East service user","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Very grateful for Emergency surgery","body":"Five weeks ago I went to a muscular skeletal appointment and north tyneside general hospital during my consultation with the consultant I was then sent for a emergency mri on my spine at Cramlington emergency care hospital.  \r\nUpon results later the same day I was then sent via ambulance to the R.

I want to know why we can't take prescriptions to our own local chemist if they are issued at Broomfield hospital? Today's wait was already 1hr 30 mins and is bound to be increasing because patients are unable to take prescriptions to their own local chemist. when I had the same issue in December 2019 I had to wait 3 hours for a prescription to be dispensed. Surely allowing patience to take prescriptions issued at broomfield hospital to their own pharmacy would reduce these excessive wait times and also improve wait times for medication for patients waiting to be discharged from your hospitals and mean beds are available quicker. this also has a impact on parking at the hospital as the longer patients are sat waiting for prescriptions unnecessarily the longer their cars are blocking the car park.  I am sure the staff at the front desk of the pharmacy are fed up of hearing patients complain about this. Why can't this be looked into? Please note this review in no way reflects the staff at the Pharmacy who are always helpful and polite and who do a thankless job. They deserve not to have patients like me moan at them about things like this, their time can be used in better ways!

Biopsy came back negative, but PSA kept rising.  \r\nFurther MRI with contrast was done and was told by phone call that it had shown something that was difficult to biopsy and would require template biopsy. This time cancer was diagnosed and further bone scan etc were ordered. As quite a time had passed I decided to seek a private consultation and was admitted for radical surgery within two weeks, I had yet to attend all of the NHS consultants, but time was now a consideration.  \r\nWhile all staff were great, they were also very upbeat, masking the urgency that has turned out to be obvious. I now know that the original MRI noted the likelihood of cancer, yet without my contact nothing was done, the second MRI report stated \"urgent\" yet more than six months had passed since the scan and I had still to see any surgeon or oncologist. Hence the private consult.  \r\nIn total this process had taken almost two years and now my psi is once again detectable.
