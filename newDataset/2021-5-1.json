Caroline also made me feel like the decision was mine at each step of the way which helped me feel more in control. (I needed this as my first labour was the opposite due to a last minute induction).  \r\nOnce in my birthing room Caroline and Lynn both managed my late stages of labour within the birthing pool and they were superb at keeping me focused, positive and on track. Caroline and Lynn had a great tag team approach that made me feel that I was in really good hands. They made me laugh and lifted my spirits when labour was getting tough, I felt like I was being really well looked after the whole time. They also made my husband feel very relaxed and a real part of the delivery which he was very grateful for.  \r\nThe whole experience was unbelievably positive and my little boy was delivered in a very calm and relaxed environment.  \r\nCaroline and Lynn make a great team and my experience could not have been any better, they are an absolute credit to their profession.  \r\nThank you so much ladies, an amazing experience I will remember positively forever.

When the prescription stopped it was so easy to buy them illicitly that I didn’t even consider how dangerous it might be until it was too late.  \r\nI made terrible decisions which made my life worse, not better. When it all caught up with me my GP surgery told me about Taith. With regular help from Richard - who is a kind, understanding and knowledgable person - I tapered my diazepam use and made plans again.  \r\nIt’s not easy and without the help from this service it would have been even worse.

I felt so at ease knowing I was in great care and Keith provided so much reassurance and comfort to what was one of the worst experiences I’ve ever endured.  \r\nI am so grateful for how quick the Glencoe paramedics arrived and dealt with the situation at hand and I will always be thankful for your care and compassion.  \r\nI would also like to thank the Fort William Ambulance service who took care of us from Glencoe to the Belford hospital.  \r\nI would like to thank Andy and his team (I’m sorry I didn’t catch your names!) who provided excellent care to both my partner and I. You all made a horrible experience more bearable with compassion and thorough care. You also made a horrible journey, as smooth as possible considering the circumstances.  \r\nI can’t thank you all enough for everything you all done for us, we will be forever grateful.  \r\nA massive thanks,  \r\n(From Glasgow, involved in head on collusion at Glencoe)","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-04-29T12:02:39.0233333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-05-01T14:44:40.24","readBy":[{"name":"Scottish Ambulance Service","count":14}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/842259","id":"842259"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/842259/responses","id":"842259"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/842259/healthservices","id":"842259"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/842259/tags","id":"842259"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/h212h_180","id":"H212H_180","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/scot-ambulance-emergency","id":"scot-ambulance-emergency","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/monitoring","id":"monitoring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain%20relief","id":"pain relief"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/road%20accident","id":"road accident"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassion","id":"compassion"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wonderful%20staff","id":"wonderful staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/observations","id":"observations"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ambulance%20staff","id":"ambulance staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20ease","id":"at ease"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/843450","id":"843450"}]},{"id":842266,"author":"Squall","authorRoleId":1,"authorRole":"a carer","title":"COVID-19 Astrazeneca vaccine (1st dose)","body":"I experienced mild upper arm pain during the evening of Tuesday 27th April 2021 (after the vaccine) and the next day also.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-04-29T13:20:18.9","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-05-01T14:47:05.403","readBy":[{"name":"South Eastern Health and Social Care Trust","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/842266","id":"842266"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/842266/responses","id":"842266"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/842266/healthservices","id":"842266"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/842266/tags","id":"842266"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt004-sse-vc","id":"zt004-sse-vc","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/arm","id":"arm"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%20vaccine","id":"covid vaccine"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/843036","id":"843036"}]},{"id":842841,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Best GP Practice ","body":"A big thank you to The Knares Surgery.

The nurse, Suzie, was absolutely phenomenal from the start of the appointment to the very end. She is a kind, diligent, caring and compassionate lady and I’m extremely grateful for her thorough approach to advising and treating me, and also for her personable and genuine manner.  \r\nShe took time to reassure me and explain everything from a medical perspective, as well as imparting knowledge from her many years experience. Suzie really goes the extra mile to ensure her patient feels reassured, up to date and kept in the loop moving forward. She was very kind and really put me at ease during the examination, as did her colleague. Throughout my pregnancy, the care I received from Suzie has been by far the most thorough and diligent, and I have come away feeling very happy and satisfied with the experience.

The need for a neurophysiological team for the prior support and during the actual operation was detailed and worked well. Therefore, the brain operation went exactly as expected. As a result, two weeks later, there was little to discuss with the neurosurgeon that was not done or understood by me. The transfer to conduct Chemotherapy and Radiation treatment will be done at a nearer Hospital and the best opportunities were made by Royal Stoke and are complete. For me everybody not only understood all the aspects that were required but did not allow any delayed aspect due to Covid restrictions. This provided the best method of dealing with my cancer in the shortest time effectively. That was an epically high quality of people and sources at Royal Stoke and was magic to see.
