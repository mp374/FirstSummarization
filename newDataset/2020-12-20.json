I was extremely distressed to receive this, since I had experienced severe respiratory problems, was using Ventolin, and had explained that I had to leave and get fresh air. As the symptoms exacerbate, speaking becomes difficult and inadvisable. I didn't know that I was supposed to have informed the receptionist that I was C.E.V. and had assumed that arriving not more than 10 minutes before an appointment meant that this was a precaution meant to prevent people being around for a long time before being seen. If so, it failed in my instance, since I was in the reception area for an hour and forty minutes, wearing a mask which restricted my already compromised respiration. I continued wearing it , since I cough often, since as afore mentioned , I have C.O.P.D. \n  ","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-12-19T14:38:05","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2020-12-20T08:12:20","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/812079","id":"812079"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/812079/responses","id":"812079"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/812079/healthservices","id":"812079"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/812079/tags","id":"812079"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rwh01","id":"RWH01","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cough","id":"cough"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/distressed","id":"distressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/respiratory","id":"respiratory"}]},{"id":812082,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"The best GP surgery there is","body":"The doctors are superb and always have time for even tricky issues and requests; the nurses also perform to the highest standard; receptionists and other practice staff also efficient, warm, kind, and helpful.

I rarely phone the practice because it’s so difficult to speak to anyone but today I knew what was wrong with me and a simple prescription was all that was required.I must add that the reception staff are always brilliant, I can’t praise them enough but they are limited in what they can do.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-12-16T20:12:39.8133333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-12-21T08:01:35.217","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Sheffield ICB","count":5},{"name":"Healthwatch Sheffield","count":1},{"name":"Yorkshire Ambulance Service NHS Trust","count":1},{"name":"The Health  Care Surgery","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/811270","id":"811270"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/811270/responses","id":"811270"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/811270/healthservices","id":"811270"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/811270/tags","id":"811270"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/c88077","id":"C88077","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rx8-nhs111","id":"RX8-nhs111","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stress","id":"stress"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20upset","id":"very upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/access%20to%20services","id":"access to services"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/antibiotics","id":"antibiotics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bladder","id":"bladder"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/infection","id":"infection"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pharmacy","id":"Pharmacy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/prescribing%20antibiotics","id":"prescribing antibiotics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/receptionists","id":"receptionists"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/telephone%20contact","id":"telephone contact"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/time%20wasted","id":"time wasted"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/walk","id":"walk"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bladder%20infection","id":"bladder infection"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/812359","id":"812359"}]},{"id":812176,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Urgent Care terrible attitude ","body":"I went to A&E at 4AM this morning (19/12/20), and was referred to the Urgent Care Department.

They again asked us to wear a visor and again I had to explain that a visor is a face covering and we are medically exempt. They then said it was for the staff's protection, thereby implying that my father and I were walking contaminants who would contaminate everything around us. This was insulting, degrading and humiliating, especially given that there were 4 staff members all standing around huddled together with zero social distancing between them!  \r\nWhilst the Ophthalmologist themselves was pleasant and efficient and the other staff very pleasant and approachable, staff need to be fully aware that face covering exemption does not just cover a mask but covers all types of face coverings and that they must respect hidden disabilities the same way that obvious disabilities are respected.

She gave me lots of support as I was struggling seeing my wee dude so poorly, if it wasn't for covid I'm sure she would have gave the best hugs. Deborah listened to all my worries and concerns and didn't judge me. So I would truly from the bottom of my heart like to say thank you to Deborah for everything.  \r\nI would also like to thank Janice.

Or feel they drink too much. I have been alcohol dependent for the last four years. But am now, thanks to acknowledging that it was a problem and getting the help I needed, 15 days dry. Most won’t have even noticed I had a problem but I was good at hiding it!  \r\nHow it started?  \r\nOne night four years ago I had a seizure whilst in bed. It gripped me like a vice. My body was shaking yet I was conscious of what was happening. I immediately got tinnitus. A very loud ringing in my ear which I still have to this day. I didn’t know how to cope and after six months of heavy depression and panic attacks I reached for the bottle.  \r\nAt this point I hadn’t drank for 10 years. At first the wine was to me medicinal and helped for a while but soon my drinking became the main problem and after years of abuse, 30units a night, my liver was starting to struggle. Then 2020 came around and the almost total lockdown and loss of jobs drove me deeper into dependence.  \r\nAs the year set in I started to make new decision’s for my future, building my career and focusing on what I enjoy. But in order to reach my full potential and be around to see the results I knew I had to face my fears.  \r\nI reached out to change grow live in Nottingham and joined their weekly zoom meetings. I was told after blood samples and an assessment that if I could lower my intake to 15 units a day for an extended time I could be considered for a monitored home medical detox. (Normally it would only happen in rehab)  \r\nThis was a golden ticket for me and it’s the best thing I have ever done. It’s not been easy and I had to want it 100% which I did and still do. I still attend the zoom groups and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. The team that helped me were and are incredible people. From Kerry the nurse calling me everyday, to Rachel my support worker who talked and walked me through the process, to Dean who selflessly administered the zoom meetings each week and to John who travels to my home to encourage me and check I’m on track. I thank you all!  \r\nI still have thoughts and maybe always will, but thoughts don’t kill you but alcohol dependence will.  \r\nAnyway all that to say whatever you may be struggling with please please please do not keep it to yourself. There are professional people out there that can and will help if you want it.  \r\nI wish you all a happy, healthy Christmas and a prosperous new year.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-12-21T13:09:00.6333333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-12-21T13:34:07.317","readBy":[{"name":"Change Grow Live","count":5}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/812215","id":"812215"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/812215/responses","id":"812215"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/812215/healthservices","id":"812215"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/812215/tags","id":"812215"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/nms-cglnotts","id":"nms-cglnotts","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/abuse","id":"abuse"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/alcohol","id":"alcohol"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood","id":"blood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dependent","id":"dependent"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/depression","id":"depression"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/detox","id":"detox"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/drinking","id":"drinking"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ear","id":"ear"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good","id":"good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/groups","id":"groups"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helped","id":"helped"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/liver","id":"liver"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurse","id":"nurse"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/seizure","id":"seizure"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support%20worker","id":"support worker"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/team","id":"team"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/the%20change","id":"the change"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tinnitus","id":"tinnitus"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happy","id":"happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/remote%20support","id":"remote support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/more%20group%20discussion","id":"more group discussion"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/812733","id":"812733"}]},{"id":811604,"author":"Counsellor31","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Disappointment with labour care","body":"Arrived at admissions at 5pm, 4cm dilated with first baby. We had been timing contractions so I had an idea how far along I was, but was sadly met with immediate dismissal by midwife (before she checked me). Seemed inconvenienced by our arrival & seemed to assume we were being over eager as first time parents. Appeared surprised when they checked and discovered I was 4cm.  \r\nWas then admitted but only to A Ward (non labour ward) without explanation why this was. I had visited ABC unit during pregnancy & verbally requested this if possible on arrival, as well as having detailed written preference for birthing there in my notes (which sadly I believe to have been ignored). Was left for several hours at the end of the non labour ward, briefly greeted by different midwives on a handful of occasions & offered oral pain relief. Felt highly conscious of the labour noises I was making whilst all other women around me were Not in labour.  \r\nBy 9.30pm I was 9cm dilated and my husband had to run up the ward to encourage someone to come to us, at which point I was rushed to delivery suite to push and baby was born safely by 11pm. Very happy with consequent care in delivery suite by an experienced midwife and a student midwife who were both encouraging and caring. However, feel let down by lack of care prior to that point and confused as to why I was left to labour mostly alone (except thankfully for my husband) at the end of A ward. My guess is that the speed of my labour was faster than many first time mums, and assumptions were made that proper checks could be delayed with me until a shift handover took place.  \r\nNow pregnant with second baby, due March ‘21 and discussed my prev. experience with a very helpful attentive midwife at my 28 week apt. who checked my prev. notes and relayed that there was no reason recorded why I couldn’t have laboured and delivered in ABC unit before. Advised me to speak about this preference again at every opportunity from now on in this pregnancy, as well as adding extra sheets of A4 to my current notes specifying this, so it is ‘unavoidable’ to notice this time. Also recommended encouraging my husband to strongly advocate for me again and often in this respect.  \r\nI will do all of the above but am discouraged that I now feel obligated to pester staff in order to have preferences acknowledged and supported this time. (To clarify, I had no pregnancy or labour complications whatsoever so these preferences were reasonable and simple, making it even more bewildering for us why they were ignored.)  \r\nThrough my first pregnancy, I had felt calm and open-minded about all aspects of delivery previously, including agreeing to student midwife care at various points. I had my preferences but I additionally really put my trust in the staff to guide us supportively through our first baby’s birth, and I believe we were let down for no real reason I can identify.

I have had 2 admissions to ward 6. The nhs staff In general from A & E & ward 6 have been amazing.  \r\nDuring my second admission to hospital I was moved to the ward after having amazing care in A & E. I was in a room with 4 other woman and when I was seen by the surgical team I requested to get home as I had work commitments, a family wedding & 2 young children at home. The surgeons agreed to let me home .. after about 10 mins I was happy to be leaving until 2 nurses had to come In and explain we had been in contact with a patient who had now tested positive for COVID-19. I was extremely upset about this as I am now having to isolate , miss a family wedding & cancel all my work before Christmas. I am self-employed and this year has been so stressful without being able to earn money. I do not understand why this girl was moved to a ward into a room with 3 other people while waiting on Covid-19 test results! The worry of getting this virus is horrible, while I was in the ward having obs taken with the same blood pressure monitor & pulse checker on 4 people in the room without being sanitised inbetween patients is extremely worrying. The guidlines clearly state you must isolate until you receive your results & sanitising tools and equipment is a number 1 priority to stop the spread. The clear lack of communication between hospitals and generally a situation that could have been avoided.  \r\nThe stress and anxiety this has caused me being a new mum for the second time this year and suffering with so much pain and having to attended the hospital regularly in the past few weeks has made me feel so scared to come back if I need urgent medical help. All the staff are completely amazing and I admire the job they do although someone has gone wrong in this situation as potentially could have spread this virus due to a lack of communication.  \r\nI wanted to make you aware about this experience as I feel this could have been avoided. I hope someone can get back to me on this. This is not a complaint about the medical care I just want to try and help make sure no one else is put in the same situation.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-12-18T07:13:25.7333333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-12-21T13:51:04.767","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lanarkshire","count":10},{"name":"North Lanarkshire Health & Social Care Partnership","count":1},{"name":"North Lanarkshire Advocacy","count":1},{"name":"Partnership for Change","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/811722","id":"811722"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/811722/responses","id":"811722"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/811722/healthservices","id":"811722"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/811722/tags","id":"811722"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l106h_101","id":"L106H_101","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l106h_180","id":"L106H_180","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disappointed","id":"disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scared","id":"scared"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stress","id":"stress"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/infection%20control","id":"infection control"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medical%20care","id":"medical care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/removal%20of%20gallstones","id":"Removal of gallstones"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/a&e%20care","id":"A&E care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/coronavirus","id":"coronavirus"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%20precautions","id":"covid precautions"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sanitizing","id":"sanitizing"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/813446","id":"813446"}]},{"id":812229,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Good practice let down by individual receptionist","body":"Had an unfortunate phonecall with OSS this morning to ask for a telephone appointment with a particular doctor (as advised by reception yesterday) due to changes in my condition in ref to my breast clinic referral.\n Receptionist did not even look on the system and was very rude and short with me.
