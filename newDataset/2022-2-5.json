You are locked out of the surgery and can only come in If you have an appointment. So in theory any queries have to be phoned in and you are in a queue for on occasions over an hour plus! You can only have a face to face according the the receptionist if the GP deems it necessary post a telephone consultation. I have no idea what this service is that they are offering armed with rude GPs and a limited number of receptionist that know what they are doing I would not recommend anyone joining this practise and fear there will be big catastrophe with patients health if there is no intervention with how this service is being run! I have so many experiences of awful care/service from them. Where they don’t do what they say they will do. Putting patient health at risk. Not appropriate to list here. But sufficient to drive me to write this after years of being with this surgery. They do not listen to hear! They are not fit to be called a surgery and need closing down.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-02-05T11:49:32","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2022-02-05T16:56:40","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/914376","id":"914376"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/914376/responses","id":"914376"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/914376/healthservices","id":"914376"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/914376/tags","id":"914376"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/k81026","id":"K81026","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fear","id":"fear"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20risk","id":"at risk"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/face","id":"face"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/get%20fit","id":"get fit"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/insignificant","id":"insignificant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"}]},{"id":914381,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Good service","body":"I just want to balance the other terrible reviews, I know people only usually write reviews when something goes wrong.\n\nA couple of months ago I rang the practice to discuss a couple of problems, I rang at 2pm and was in with the doctor by 4pm.\n\nThis week I rang, again about 2pm and had a telephone consultation with the GP the next day, followed by a chat with the pharmacist.\n\nAll the staff are friendly and helpful.

Twenty minutes later, I got a call from the nurse practitioner, who was straight-to-the-point but friendly, and he explained that he would send off a prescription for me to pick up at the pharmacy about 30 minutes later. He called me back to confirm that the prescription had been ordered and he advised me to call back or make an appointment with my GP if my symptoms didn't improve. \n\nOverall great experience.

Nothing appeared to fall within the GP’s remit e.g. referrals for physio, memory loss. Much of the advice given was common sense. A review was carried out but only because I pushed. At the end of the appointment I said I was disappointed. After a lack of face to face appointments for some time due to covid and the fact it was supposed to be a medical review appointment I had expected more. At the end of the appointment the door was shut in my face when I was still speaking. I would not recommend this practice despite the fact that the receptionists are very sweet. A very unprofessional doctor and an upsetting experience all round.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-02-05T17:22:28","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-02-05T19:47:38","readBy":[{"name":"Sheffield Hallam University, Nursing BSc (20-9)","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/914388","id":"914388"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/914388/responses","id":"914388"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/914388/healthservices","id":"914388"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/914388/tags","id":"914388"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/h81070","id":"H81070","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disappointed","id":"disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/face","id":"face"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/memory","id":"memory"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/memory%20loss","id":"memory loss"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/physio","id":"physio"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20disappointed","id":"very disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid","id":"covid"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pushed%20out","id":"pushed out"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%2019","id":"covid 19"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/shut%20out","id":"shut out"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/919448","id":"919448"}]},{"id":914393,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Wonderful treatment/staff","body":"I was brought in as emergency having suffered a complete heart block!
