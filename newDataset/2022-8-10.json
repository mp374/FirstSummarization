The only thing I am able to eat is the breakfast in the morning, and I’m pretty sure that’s only because you have to be especially bad to mess up breakfast.","criticality":"minimally critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-08-07T14:04:35.4066667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-08-10T07:48:27.7","readBy":[{"name":"Southern Health and Social Care Trust","count":6}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/964048","id":"964048"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/964048/responses","id":"964048"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/964048/healthservices","id":"964048"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/964048/tags","id":"964048"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_33020-surgical-m","id":"ZT003_33020-surgical-m","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breakfast","id":"breakfast"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctors","id":"doctors"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/enjoyable","id":"enjoyable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/food","id":"food"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tidy","id":"tidy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ward%20temperature","id":"ward temperature"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/clean","id":"clean"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/967444","id":"967444"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/975305","id":"975305"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/975331","id":"975331"}]},{"id":964051,"author":"Natbs79","authorRoleId":7,"authorRole":"a staff member posting for a carer/relative","title":"Couldn't fault the care provided","body":"After my daughter developed an infection, I brought her into Daisy Hill Hospital's Emergency Department.

I came into the assessment unit, where I was taken in and given gas and air immediately, I was then brought up to the labour ward where two lovely nurses, Mairead and Ann gave me such good advice. Due to my previous pregnancy I was told that for any future pregnancies l would need a caesarean due to my anatomy. Ann and Mairead said that if I did in fact need to be sectioned that they would ensure it happened.  \r\nThis was perfect as I feel that there are times when it feels like the nurses do not want to advise or promote caesarean sections. Since being moved to the ward everything has been unbelievably good. The staff have been brilliant helping me to look after my baby - I haven't had to worry about a thing since coming in. All of them are amazing especially the day staff who were on yesterday. It has actually been quite a relaxing experience which I did not expect.

His clinician, was so lovely! Her history taking was thorough, explanations really clear and understandable, and the testing she carried out enabled her to identify a vestibular issue which, after more than seven weeks of dizziness was really difficult for my husband to deal with. He is now feeling more positive about the way forward and even more determined to make steady improvements. So, our heartfelt thanks to our amazing clinician. ( I would like to have named her, but was not able to do so due to hospital policy) \nAll this , after a slow start following him attending A&E, when it became evident that his review appointment had not been arranged. Our thanks to the Appointments Hotline staff for ensuring that this was rectified. Well done NHS!!

A massive thank you to all the reception staff and the GP’s.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-08-09T21:26:15","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-08-10T09:02:20","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/964858","id":"964858"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/964858/responses","id":"964858"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/964858/healthservices","id":"964858"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/964858/tags","id":"964858"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/m87602","id":"M87602","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/distressed","id":"distressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/early%20pregnancy","id":"early pregnancy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pregnancy","id":"pregnancy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/965045","id":"965045"}]},{"id":964864,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Stroke unit / ward110","body":"A big thankyou to all the fantastic people who looked after me during my stroke.i have never met a more dedicated friendly and competent group of people.they were truly wonderful from arriving,paralysed down one side to walking out quite well with hopefully  no lasting defects.i really cannot thank this team enough and they are a credit to the trust and the nhs.one word..wonderful..\n","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-08-09T21:38:25","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-08-10T09:02:52","readBy":[{"name":"Hull University Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/964864","id":"964864"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/964864/responses","id":"964864"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/964864/healthservices","id":"964864"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/964864/tags","id":"964864"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rwa","id":"RWA","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/group","id":"group"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/looked%20after","id":"looked after"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/paralysed","id":"paralysed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stroke","id":"stroke"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fantastic","id":"fantastic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doing%20well","id":"doing well"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20looked%20after","id":"not looked after"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/966201","id":"966201"}]},{"id":964866,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Great clinic in MK","body":"Staff were lovely, was seen to on time, if not early.\nMRI was fully explained and 45 minute scan flew by.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-08-09T21:53:37","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-08-10T09:02:53","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/964866","id":"964866"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/964866/responses","id":"964866"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/964866/healthservices","id":"964866"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/964866/tags","id":"964866"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/nv1","id":"NV1","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mri","id":"mri"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scan","id":"scan"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/965136","id":"965136"}]},{"id":964063,"author":"romeomg63","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Unexpected few nights at Lincoln county hospital","body":"After a visit to our practice nurse in Market Rasen I was told to take my chest pain directly to the Lincoln SDEC without delay.

SDEC staff were brilliant explaining in basic terms what had happened and what was needed.  \r\nI was taken to a bed in A&E where two young doctors prepped me for the drain explaining everything and being kind and considerate at all stages. With the drain in and pain killers administered I was admitted to the RSU where I was greeted by friendly and kind staff again who settled me down and answered my questions.  \r\nNext day I was visited by the practitioner nurse and the consultant. They again introduced themselves and explained all had gone very well and that I was on course for a release in about another 24 hours. I was checked and made comfortable very regularly but in a way that did not cause me distress or concern. They were true to their word and following more checks and x rays I got home by 17:00 next day.  \r\nI can't thank the team at Lincoln county enough.

I came in with my son at 4.45 and doctor saw my son at 11.30 and waited further 4 hours for blood results. Staff are under trained. My son was left hungry from 4.45pm. The management of the hospital is appalling. Staff at the UTC sandwell are rude. As I came into the car park. I spotted a car park space, however a staff from the utc decided to stand in the bay so I don’t park there and she refused to move as I reversing, I then realised she was standing there so her colleague can park. I was left to park very far and it made it difficult for my son to walk as he was feeling dizzy. They both ignored the fact I was attending the utc.

I had been out with a friend, doing some messages, when he said I looked a bit pale and I should see a GP. I knew I couldn’t just walk into my GP so I tried to get an ambulance up to the hospital. When that was not possible I phoned a taxi to take me to the hospital. I then collapsed and began fitting outside the ED.  \r\nI was admitted to the ED and then on up to the ward. All the staff have been helpful and friendly. The nurses are both pleasant, efficient and kind. All the nurses are compassionate and kind. I have enjoyed the ward environment and the entire place is very clean.  \r\nMy only issues have been that some patients can be quite disruptive and this can be very unsettling for myself and other patients. I think it would be beneficial to everyone for there to be a ward for sick people who are also dealing with mental health issues or addiction, with specially trained mental health nurses, alongside the medical nurses, allowing those patients to get the care they need and deserve from the hospital. It would also help other patients in the hospital as well","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-08-07T15:30:37.18","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-08-10T09:21:01.467","readBy":[{"name":"Southern Health and Social Care Trust","count":8}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/964070","id":"964070"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/964070/responses","id":"964070"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/964070/healthservices","id":"964070"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/964070/tags","id":"964070"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_33020_180","id":"ZT003_33020_180","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_33020-medical-f","id":"ZT003_33020-medical-f","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/accident%20&%20emergency","id":"accident & emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cleanliness","id":"cleanliness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/efficient","id":"efficient"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/epilepsy","id":"epilepsy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helpful","id":"helpful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kind","id":"kind"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pleasant","id":"pleasant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unsettled","id":"unsettled"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassionate","id":"compassionate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medical%20ward","id":"medical ward"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/966907","id":"966907"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/968964","id":"968964"}]},{"id":964870,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Medical Form Completion Request From A Doctor","body":"This is my Surgery that I am registered to.

I appreciate this is an out of hours service, but I was told up to 8 weeks wait for a form to be completed and you have to pay for this service. I think this is a terrible response from the practice. I have now been forced to seek a private doctor who needs to see my own medical records so have then had to request this from the practice. They don't seem to care that in this climate you could lose an offer of employment. Their lack of help and empathy in this situation is absolutely zero. I hope they are never in this position where they require assistance of this nature from a service. I rang the practice on 4 separate occasions to explain the situation and you can tell your pleas are falling on deaf ears. I even spoke with the practice manager who really couldn't care less either.\n\nIf your thinking of registering here, i really wouldn't bother.

He advised me to check every morning sharp 8. Most of the morning calls never go through as you are waiting in queue after 20/25 people even if you start at 8. Today I got through and a lady said there is no appointment and she could have made advance appointment ( contrary to other receptionist ) but there is none in next 3 days. she is not willing to give any appointment for next week too. They don't make any effort to give you some dates even after 3/4 days after you repeatedly ask for. They are rude and they give you unsolicited advice what you should do and what you should not. For example regarding my baby's weight concern she said we don't do weight check. However I constantly asked for doctor's appointment to discuss about baby's health along with weight check. i am still waiting even after a week. This is utter nonsense.

I have been in and out of the hospital over the past 5 years since my diagnosis so I am well experienced. I started to feel unwell last week, and I knew there was no point in coming into the hospital at the weekend. So I phoned my GP after the weekend, who contacted the ED in Daisy Hill. I spent 18 hours sitting in the waiting area in a chair before I was told that my blood results were normal and I was sent home. I was also referred to Belfast as the viral infection had spread to my eyes and they had become all red and swollen. I sat in Belfast for 8 hours and then I was able to go home. I still felt really ill so I went to sleep the second I got home. A few hours later I woke up in absolute agony, I was in tears with the pain. I wasn’t able to put a millimetre of pressure through my feet, which had been sore since the previous week. I had to throw myself off my bed and slide down the stairs in order to be able to phone 999 before I passed out. I was brought back into the hospital and spent 20 hours waiting for a bed down in the ED. I was then finally brought up to the ward and given proper pain relief. Throughout all of this I found that some doctors that I interacted with did not really listen to me. I felt that if I had come in with drugs or alcohol related problems I would have been seen a lot faster. It was infuriating waiting to see a doctor as all they could offer me was paracetamol until I had been seen when I am on morphine at home to help with the pain.  \r\nSince arriving on the ward, the staff have been amazing. They’re totally brilliant. The staff are very kind and caring. The food has been alright since I arrived, it could be a lot better. The food has varied a lot over the past few years. In 2017 it was atrocious, from 2018-2019 the food was amazing. But it has gone downhill again since then, but I know it must be difficult to cook for so many people at once.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-08-07T14:30:35.6133333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-08-10T09:36:19.68","readBy":[{"name":"Southern Health and Social Care Trust","count":8},{"name":"Public Health Agency","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/964054","id":"964054"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/964054/responses","id":"964054"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/964054/healthservices","id":"964054"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/964054/tags","id":"964054"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_33020-medical-f","id":"ZT003_33020-medical-f","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/should%20listen","id":"Should listen"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/999","id":"999"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/accident%20&%20emergency","id":"accident & emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing%20staff","id":"amazing staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20tests","id":"blood tests"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/caring","id":"caring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/chronic%20kidney%20disease","id":"chronic kidney disease"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency","id":"emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/food","id":"food"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gp","id":"GP"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kind","id":"kind"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nephropathy","id":"nephropathy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain%20relief","id":"pain relief"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unwell","id":"unwell"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/viral%20infection","id":"viral infection"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wait%20times","id":"wait times"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/inconsistencies","id":"inconsistencies"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain%20managed","id":"pain managed"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/966627","id":"966627"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/966900","id":"966900"}]},{"id":964112,"author":"melondt48","authorRoleId":3,"authorRole":"a parent/guardian","title":"Excellent support and caring and efficient staff","body":"My son fell on some barbed wire and cut his chest open.

To skip Casualty was a big relief.  \r\nI am writing to tell you how grateful I am to Dr Khalil and the Cardiac Team, Michelle, Janette & Andrew who were assigned to my father with his cardiac issues. The competency of the team on the Cardiac Hub was inspiring, and he couldn't have been luckier. I was amazed by the team you have working there. The Cardiac team probably save a lot of lives in a given year, but let me tell you that this life is forever grateful. Your work is so important. In every way. Thank you, we will never forget what you've done for us. To think that this service is on our own door step and let’s not forget it is free. The Cardiac Hub and ward 44 have been outstanding and extremely helpful during an extremely difficult time for me. Thank you so very much for looking after my precious father. You are all so kind, caring and dedicated. Thank you for all the amazing work you do, especially in these difficult times. Dr Khalil you are one of the kindest people I have ever met you never gave up getting everything just right for my dad. You are such an ambassador for the Western Trust. I am sure the Cardiac Hub and Team saved my father’s life. I also want to thank Dr Casey from Eglinton Medical Centre for all her help and time she really is something else when it comes to being a doctor. Dad has improved so much and is happy to be back in his greenhouse and gardens doing what he loves best.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-07-21T20:44:37.8433333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-08-10T09:47:45.05","readBy":[{"name":"Western Health and Social Care Trust","count":7},{"name":"Public Health Agency","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/958721","id":"958721"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/958721/responses","id":"958721"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/958721/healthservices","id":"958721"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/958721/tags","id":"958721"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt005_45020_320","id":"ZT005_45020_320","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing%20staff","id":"amazing staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cardiac","id":"cardiac"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cardiac%20ward","id":"cardiac ward"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cardiology","id":"cardiology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctor","id":"doctor"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/heart","id":"heart"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kind","id":"kind"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lucky","id":"lucky"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/safe","id":"safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/relieved","id":"relieved"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/competency","id":"competency"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/965163","id":"965163"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/965606","id":"965606"}]},{"id":964082,"author":"hydrusby59","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Radiology","body":"I attended radiology for a CT scan following a letter which raised concerns for me.  \r\nOn arrival I was called quickly by the a radiologist.

As a nervous first time mum I was willing to give the course a go to see what it was like. The course was ran in the spectrum center in the shankill, this meant a 30/40 min journey on 2 buses every Tuesday. This class taught me how to interpret what my baby was telling me and how to become more confident as a mum. Not only was the teaching element of the class helpful, seeing Jayne, Zoley and Angela every week became a great comfort to me. I knew if I ever had a question I could either wait to ask them at my class or text them, they have really supported me throughout my babies early months of life and I feel I have became a better mum because it. I also have enjoyed how much group discussions there was and knowing other mums had the same feelings and worries as myself made everything so much better for me. I honestly think I have been so lucky to have been included in this class and the opportunity should be open to all mums. I really hope they have other classes available for my baby as she grows as it will help me cope with different stages of life with her, and she loves to see the girls every week and will miss them much as myself, a lot when the classes finish up.&nbsp;","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-07-27T14:59:26.33","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-08-10T10:22:01.16","readBy":[{"name":"Belfast Health and Social Care Trust","count":8}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/960653","id":"960653"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/960653/responses","id":"960653"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/960653/healthservices","id":"960653"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/960653/tags","id":"960653"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt001-behaviour-nurse","id":"zt001-behaviour-nurse","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/classes","id":"classes"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/content","id":"content"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/group","id":"group"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/groups","id":"groups"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confident","id":"confident"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happy","id":"happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/group%20discussions","id":"Group discussions"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/group%20leaders","id":"group leaders"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/videos","id":"videos"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/song%20time","id":"song time"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/new%20born%20baby","id":"new born baby"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/964997","id":"964997"}]},{"id":964222,"author":"Shagq75","authorRoleId":8,"authorRole":"a staff member posting for a patient/service user","title":"Everything is going smoothly","body":"Accident and emergency was very stressful, the wait was the longest though.

She has vascular dementia and this has been worsening recently. Libby attended at my mother’s house to carry out review and I attended too. This is the first time I felt I was supported in any way. Libby highlighted services available to us as we were totally unaware of any help and no one had ever mentioned anything to us. We have had a bad experience with social care services in the past and with the assistance of Libby’s intervention, this has improved considerably to the point that I feel I can relax knowing that my mother is being cared for well.  \r\nThings have improved so much that I have felt confident to return to work and have been able to go on holiday with my own family, knowing that my mum is safe. Being advised that day care is eventually reopening is also helping as my mother is wandering due to boredom.  \r\nDementia Scotland have been of no use as, although they have a timetable of activities available for my mother to attend, they do not have a transport service for mum as she cannot go on her own as we all work.  \r\nBuddi service has been working well although GPS signal drops often and it worries me that my mum could be quite a distance away before it picks up the signal. Still better with Buddi than without.  \r\nI haven’t utilised the respite care or services available to me yet.","criticality":"minimally critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-07-27T19:48:37.2666667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-08-10T10:44:14.73","readBy":[{"name":"East Ayrshire Health and Social Care Partnership","count":9}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/960737","id":"960737"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/960737/responses","id":"960737"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/960737/healthservices","id":"960737"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/960737/tags","id":"960737"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/s37000008-ahsocc","id":"S37000008-ahsocc","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/boredom","id":"boredom"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/availability","id":"availability"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/caring","id":"caring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/follow%20up","id":"follow up"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/personal%20care","id":"personal care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vascular%20dementia","id":"vascular dementia"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confident","id":"confident"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/family%20kept%20informed","id":"family kept informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/promises%20kept","id":"promises kept"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/transport","id":"transport"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/personalised%20support","id":"personalised support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/relieved%20now","id":"relieved now"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/965604","id":"965604"}]},{"id":964130,"author":"greenleaves20","authorRoleId":8,"authorRole":"a staff member posting for a patient/service user","title":"Home from home","body":"Originally I was in the hospital and it was arranged for me to come to here for a short period.
