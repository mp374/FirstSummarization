Doctors tell you the very worst scenario before you've even had any tests and put fear in you causing terrible anxiety. Can't get through at 8am and by 9am appointments have all gone, reception say try tomorrow or next day, this is extremely stressful especially for senior citizens. One receptionist was very rude when asked for some paperwork from the hospital yet it was the doctor who told me to ask for it. Only one lady doctor whose very blunt no warmth. Receptionists don't know who some of the doctors are as too many locums. Was kept waiting 45 minutes past appointment time once causing anxiety. Some newer doctors make you feel uncomfortable and are blunt leaving you upset and anxious. Tests get lost or discarded and have to be repeated. Once the toilet was too filthy to use.

The Dr Clark then visited me who again was so understanding and patient centred and she explained everything.  \r\nI was lucky enough to have the most reassuring and calming midwife in Leanne young who would go on to make my whole experience a positive one.  \r\nUnfortunately I lost 1.8 litres of blood and spend around 8 hours in recovery. My experience of recovery was again a positive one with the staff being helpful, and thorough with my care while encouraging the bonding with my daughter. I was looked after by Jennifer , student midwife, who you would never guess was spending her first day of placement on a hospital ward. She was professional, passionate and had excellent communication skills. The staff that looked after me were Leanne, Sarah , Emma and Nikki who were all equally good at their jobs and nothing was too much trouble, From answering my questions to assisting me to get back on my feet after surgery all while having smile on their faces.  \r\nI was taken to the ward around 10:00pm and instantly welcomed by Eliza who would go on to be my nightshift midwife that I would be supported by for the next three nights.  \r\nOver my 4 day stay I was supported and looked after by Chantelle, Lana , Claire and Sarah who all provided excellent patient care, supporting me to breastfeed and reassuring me when things were tough. It was clear to see that they enjoyed their jobs and treated all patients with not only dignity and respect but also individualised care and treatment.  \r\nDr Clark visited me on the ward prior to discharge and she was amazing, understanding and showed care and compassion.  \r\nMy first C-section experience was a positive one thanks to the staff and their standard of care.  \r\nThank you from us all","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-07-01T22:03:06.38","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-07-05T08:02:35.067","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Fife","count":6}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1085953","id":"1085953"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1085953/responses","id":"1085953"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1085953/healthservices","id":"1085953"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1085953/tags","id":"1085953"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/f704h-maternity-mw","id":"f704h-maternity-Mw","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxious","id":"anxious"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/c-section","id":"c-section"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctor","id":"doctor"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/encouraging","id":"encouraging"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helpful%20staff","id":"helpful staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/maternity","id":"maternity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/midwife","id":"midwife"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/patient-centred","id":"patient-centred"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/positive%20experience","id":"positive experience"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/respect","id":"respect"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thorough","id":"thorough"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing","id":"amazing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassion","id":"compassion"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dignity","id":"Dignity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported","id":"supported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/explanations","id":"explanations"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/student%20midwife","id":"student midwife"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anaesthetists","id":"anaesthetists"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nothing%20too%20much%20trouble","id":"nothing too much trouble"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1091175","id":"1091175"}]},{"id":1085977,"author":"Member67","authorRoleId":4,"authorRole":"a relative","title":"Looked after as both a patient and family.","body":"My husband was admitted to have his appendix removed, initially attending the OOH GP service then being admitted to SAU, Ward 57 and finally Ward 24.

We saw the Community Paediatrician in Dec 2022 for a very helpful appointment, the first time we have interacted with a doctor since my son was discharged from the neonatal clinic in 2020. The doctor took all the history, we discussed my son's issues and they prescribed melatonin as well as referring us for a range of genetic tests.  \r\nSince then my interaction with the service e.g. to discuss dosage, follow up from blood tests etc has been incredibly poor. The secretaries are helpful and do their best in difficult circumstances but a number of doctors are on long term sick leave (and I wish them well, my frustration is not at them personally). There seems to be nothing in place for cases to be picked up by other members of the medical team.  \r\nMy son had blood tests at the beginning of May and I cannot find out the results. This was to do with low platelets and I want to know if there is still an issue. I only managed to speak to another Consultant around my son's sleep deterioration and get increased dosage prescribed following multiple emails, phone calls, contact with the Child Health Commissioner. There is no service.  \r\nParenting a child with additional support needs is difficult enough exacerbated by the constant fight for support. It is draining and exhausting and I don't believe other health conditions would be treated in this way. The lack of investment in services, the lack of follow up and care leads me to the conclusion that we live in a society where ultimately disabled children's lives are not valued and families are just left to struggle. It doesn't need to be like this.  \r\nI understand the workforce issues and the demand on services but there needs to be a more holistic approach to supporting autistic children. We get help from speech and language and I recently attended an occupational therapy workshop but there needs to be one person who is wholly responsible for my son's care who is overseeing everything and able to provide advice and support. Instead I tell our story over and over again to different professionals. Nothing is joined up. I'll begin the calls and emails again tomorrow morning looking for my son's results.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-07-02T18:56:38.0533333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-07-05T08:51:47.707","readBy":[{"name":"North Lanarkshire Health & Social Care Partnership","count":8},{"name":"Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists (RCSLT)","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1086164","id":"1086164"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1086164/responses","id":"1086164"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1086164/healthservices","id":"1086164"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1086164/tags","id":"1086164"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/s37000021-mentalhealth-camhs","id":"s37000021-mentalhealth-camhs","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frustrated","id":"frustrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/asd","id":"ASD"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/autistic","id":"autistic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/child%20health","id":"child health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/exhausted","id":"exhausted"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lack%20of%20staff","id":"lack of staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/paediatric","id":"paediatric"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/paediatrician","id":"paediatrician"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/results","id":"results"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/speech%20and%20language","id":"Speech and Language"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/secretaries","id":"secretaries"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/service","id":"service"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/neurodevelopment","id":"neurodevelopment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lack%20of%20coordination","id":"lack of coordination"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1087490","id":"1087490"}]},{"id":1086407,"author":"pyxisqx63","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Excellent service","body":"Last week I attended the Grampian Sexual Health Service for a routine contraceptive procedure and I wanted to highlight the excellent care I received from Dr Cook and Healthcare Support Worker, Ugo, whilst in clinic.  \r\nAs a nervous patient, I was anxious about the procedure, however both team members immediately put me at ease with their welcoming and professional approach.  \r\nDr Cook took the time to discuss the procedure with me, answer my questions and provide advice.

I was taken to the surgical assessment unit who dealt with my pain immediately and started tests all the while reassuring me and asking how my pain level was. From there I went to Surgical ward B3 where I spent the next 5 days on IV antibiotics and sleeping a lot. Each day the nurses would come in , do my obs, top up water, fetch towels etc. as well as having a wee chat. The consultants discussed what my plan was and made me feel I was part of this discussion, not just a patient being told what was happening.  \r\nThey decided that an operation would be required so I was taken to theatre by one of the nurses and a porter who chatted away the whole time with me. I was greeted by the theatre staff and had a wee chat with them too about the procedure.  \r\nOperation done and back to the ward with another couple of porters chatting away and asking me the odd question which I was quite oblivious to due to the anaesthetic. So here I am hoping to get home tomorrow reflecting on my patient experience.  \r\nWhat I realised this week was when we use the words person centred care, I know exactly what that means as I was at the heart of everything and felt the compassion, caring, kind, professional, quality of care, as well as listening ears and good humour of all the staff.  \r\nMy care and support have been second to none and I couldn't thank enough, all the staff I came in contact with for making me well again.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-07-02T19:59:21.5733333","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2023-07-05T08:57:27.873","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Dumfries and Galloway","count":5}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1086169","id":"1086169"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1086169/responses","id":"1086169"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1086169/healthservices","id":"1086169"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1086169/tags","id":"1086169"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/y104h_100","id":"Y104H_100","score":5},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/y104h-acutemedicine","id":"y104h-acutemedicine","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/y104h-theatre","id":"Y104H-Theatre","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anaesthetic","id":"Anaesthetic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care%20and%20support","id":"Care and support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/conversation","id":"Conversation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctors","id":"doctors"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gallstones","id":"Gallstones"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good%20humour","id":"good humour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/included","id":"included"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/iv%20antibiotics","id":"iv antibiotics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kindness","id":"kindness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/operation","id":"operation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/person-centred","id":"person-centred"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/porters","id":"porters"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/quality%20of%20care","id":"Quality of care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tests","id":"tests"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/theatre%20staff","id":"theatre staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassion","id":"compassion"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassuring","id":"reassuring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/listened%20to","id":"listened to"}]},{"id":1086211,"author":"nm11","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Very poor service from GP out of hours","body":"I called Western Urgent Care at 09:30, got quickly through to telephone centre who took my details.

Having been admitted via the Urgent Care Service and subsequently moved onto Ward 52 I was cared for by various members of staff, all of whom provided very high levels and standards of care hampered more often than not only by the lack of access to diagnostic equipment (in my case an MRI scan). I met Dr Gregory whilst on the Ward and I was immediately impressed by his openness, friendliness and informality. He explained in depth the issues I was experiencing and the next steps to be taken. He alone is the best possible advertisement for great care in the NHS.  \r\nI was recalled for a procedure in the Day Intervention Unit 2 weeks later, where my named nurse, Courtney could not have offered a higher standard of care. She simply did everything that I requested or needed with charm and sensitivity and took the time to listen to my concerns and deal with them. She and the other members of the nursing team in the Unit worked hard to keep the constant flow of patients in and out well managed. They all did this with a genuine desire to care for every one. I also met Dr John at this time, who in a similar vein to Dr Ekatah is the most charming, open and caring person. He very much put my mind at rest over any doubts I had concerning my procedure.  \r\nA week later I was called in for the final operation. On my arrival Dr Ekatah was waiting for me in the Day Surgery Unit. He further explained the whole procedure and thoroughly detailed the risks and negatives as well as the benefits. He very much, as previously made me feel more confident and relaxed about the operation. My named nurse, responsible for my care that day was Keren. I had met her a week earlier in the Day Intervention Unit where she had been helping out and she immediately recognised me. Keren is another fine example of an interested, caring nurse. She manages to juggle several tasks at once and always takes time to understand the patient's needs. She has boundless energy, operating at full steam right up until her shift ends. She represents everything that is great about the NHS and never shows any sign of discontent. She's simply first class. After Keren's shift ended my named nurse was Andy. I've yet to meet another person like Andy, who does everything with such precision and in an unruffled manner. If I had any concerns following my operation Andy, simply by his presence would have put my mind at rest. He's such an easy going yet incredibly effective nurse and sums up what great quality care is.  \r\nEvery health care professional I met during my stays in June from junior nurses through to anaesthetists, theatre staff and consultants was caring, fastidious in the way they function and extremely effective in making my stay more comfortable.  \r\nThe people more than any other aspect of my experiences made them acceptable. The hospital itself is very comfortable, clean as far as I can tell and well equipped. It simply has insufficient resources to deal with the heavy demand on the services. The staff very efficiently smooth out any deficiencies so that patient care, where possible doesn't suffer.  \r\nI thank all of the Fife NHS staff I encountered, and a special thank you goes to those I have named. Without every one of you I would not be as happy and well as I now am. Thank you one and all.","criticality":"minimally critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-07-03T11:09:26.7066667","progress":"Story has a

Thank God I couldn’t ask for a better, nicer Doctor - she was lovely as were all the nurse but to have to work in these conditions is shocking.","criticality":"minimally critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-07-03T12:29:09.7533333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-07-05T10:00:06.33","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lanarkshire","count":6}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1086451","id":"1086451"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1086451/responses","id":"1086451"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1086451/healthservices","id":"1086451"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1086451/tags","id":"1086451"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l308h-breastclinic","id":"l308h-breastclinic","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breast%20clinic","id":"breast clinic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctor","id":"doctor"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/environment","id":"environment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lovely%20staff","id":"lovely staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurse","id":"nurse"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/temperature","id":"temperature"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting%20area","id":"waiting area"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1090423","id":"1090423"}]},{"id":1086459,"author":"ophiuchusct93","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Fantastic staff","body":"I attend the breast screening clinic in May and June.

On the Wednesday I felt worse with stronger chest pains, at which point I phoned 111 and explained my symptoms, I was told to rest and they would send an ambulance which arrived within 15 minutes. I was fully examined and told I would need to go to hospital, excellent service. The downfall came as my previous text comments when I arrived at Lincoln A&E.  \r\nOnce I arrived on the short stay cardiac ward things improved dramatically with the excellent care by all the nurses on the ward. I was improving up until Friday when I had another very severe chest pains once again the nurses gave excellent care and did so all the following week. My worst experience was total lack of sleep by all the noise from other sick patients shouting out in the night to some of the night nurses talking loudly.  \r\nOverall an experience I would not like to have again, as once they have you it’s a job to escape, it takes hours to get in and hours to get out, but thankfully I’m still alive to tell the tale, so a big thank you to all concerned look

I was very upset as he had just been diagnosed with Dementia, and that had floored me, as it's always been the two of us for the past 56 years and we were never blessed with a family. Judy sat there with her arms round me and let me talk all about it. She was so comforting, I don't know how I would have got through without her friendly smile and help.  \r\nI had another meeting yesterday regarding what the possibilities were when my husband would be discharged. She let me have my say - what I thought at the time was a good plan, but Judy had made other enquiries and when I finished she then told me, at this moment in time, it wasn't feasible to take him home as I thought. He needed 24 hour care at that moment and I couldn't cope with that. What she told me made sense and I bless the day when I met her.  \r\nShe has been so kind, informative, and most of all, a most understanding person I have met since my husband took ill nearly 4 years ago.

I was immediately at ease when Paul introduced himself and was more than willing to offer any support that he could.  \r\nI really feel Paul went that extra mile with me. I would awake every morning to towels on my bed and the bathroom equipped for me to freshen up. Unfortunately I was hit with my menstrual cycle however I quickly realised this was nothing to be embarrassed about as Paul dealt with this discreetly and in his stride.  \r\nPaul made the whole hospital stay much more comfortable for me. The shifts that Paul was present seemed to be more manageable and I often found myself hoping he would be on shift.  \r\nI spent 2 weeks on this ward and cannot thank Paul enough for all of his care and attention.

The ward itself was clean and comfortable. I then met the anaesthetist (can't remember his name). He was fantastic with his explanation and my concerns around the general anaesthetic dissolved. He was very friendly and approachable. The Surgeon (Dr McCracken) then met with me and again he was brilliant. I was first on the list being an insulin dependent diabetic and again the team addressed my worries about my blood sugar levels. The entire theatre team were amazing, I only remember coming around in recovery. I was promptly returned to the ward (I wanted this so I could get dressed) and back under the care of Bronagh and Teresa. I was then given lunch which was very tasty and allowed to get up to mobilise.  \r\nMy entire experience from start to finish was excellent, the management of Ward 4 South and Theatres should be incredibly proud of their team. Thank you all so much. Hopefully I won't see you again (in the nicest possible way). You all are an asset to the NHS.

They found there was a seemingly permanent hole in my eardrum, as it had burst multiple times when I was young. The discomfort has carried on for around seven years since bursting the first time.  \r\nAfter my last appointment in December 2021 (after almost an 18 month wait) where I found out there was still a hole in my eardrum, I was told I'd be seen again in June of the next year. I have only recently received a letter of my next appointment being July 2023. Over 18 months later again.  \r\nLess than two weeks after getting my appointment letter I have been told this appointment has been cancelled by Forth Valley ENT. I feel let down and not taken seriously, as I've dealt with ear pain for years. This has prevented me from learning to swim, a skill that could be the difference between life and death, as water in my ear causes pain. I am more sensitive to water in my ear, temperature, and volume.  \r\nI have had to sit out of outdoor P.E. lessons in the winter due to the cold causing discomfort in my ear, which is affecting my education. Family outings have had to be cut short if earmuffs are forgotten, which is disappointing and overall a pain to have to deal with.  \r\nI feel all of this could have been resolved by now if the appointments had been made a priority. The inability to swim and the discomfort in the cold has made me unable to do certain things with friends and family, as well as being quite an embarrassing thing to have to admit. I hope it is resolved soon, and I do not have to deal with the disappointment of an appointment being cancelled again, as this has happened more times than appointments have gone forward at this point.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-07-03T00:21:50.1066667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-07-05T10:36:12.73","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Forth Valley","count":5}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1086214","id":"1086214"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1086214/responses","id":"1086214"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1086214/healthservices","id":"1086214"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1086214/tags","id":"1086214"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/forth-valley-royal-ent","id":"forth-valley-royal-ent","score":1},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/annoyed","id":"annoyed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disappointed","id":"disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/embarrassed","id":"embarrassed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ignored","id":"ignored"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appointments","id":"appointments"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cancellations","id":"cancellations"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/discomfort","id":"discomfort"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ear","id":"ear"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ear%20infection","id":"ear infection"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ent","id":"ent"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/in%20pain","id":"in pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/long%20wait","id":"long wait"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/priority","id":"priority"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/speed","id":"speed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting%20time","id":"waiting time"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/struggling","id":"struggling"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/impacts%20my%20life","id":"impacts my life"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1087606","id":"1087606"}]},{"id":1086550,"author":"apusfn53","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Accessing the community respiratory service","body":"I’d like to share feedback about accessing the community respiratory service from Southern health and social care trust.

This wastes our time and the time of the over worked staff within A&E and ambulance staff, not to mention money wasted going from one area to the other.  \r\nWithin respite we now have to fill out more forms every time our children have respite, this includes medication forms for the medication our children are on which the unit all ready have access to on the NHS system.  \r\nEvery consultation carried out on behalf of carers states, form filling is one of the most disliked and time consuming things carers have to do and should be reduced not increased.  \r\nWe are also being told we must date medication when we open it, this is practice used on stock medication not prescribed as the quantity given, is to be used before new prescription can be made. (Order made 1 week before you run out).  \r\nNow the school has changed to using stock emergency seizure medication, after 10+ years they can no longer keep stock supply, which due to the amount of emergency medication my child can have in one week and the time it can take to obtain from prescription, leaves my child with the high risk of not having any emergency meds at school. I have had to withdraw my child and keep them at home.  \r\nEach one of these changes were made without any consultation with carers which breaches NHS Taysides own policies.  \r\nEither bureaucracy has over taken common sense or carers are now doing the job of the nurses free of charge but full of the stress that they really do not need and it is not acceptable.  \r\nI would have preferred to write a more positive story but these issues are being ignored and children with exceptional complex medical needs are suffering from having exhausted carers falling into ill health from these practices.  \r\n","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-07-03T15:45:02.09","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-07-05T11:13:32.107","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Tayside","count":4}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1086591","id":"1086591"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1086591/responses","id":"1086591"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1086591/healthservices","id":"1086591"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1086591/tags","id":"1086591"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/st9-community-services-pcds","id":"st9-community-services-pcds","score":3},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frustrated","id":"frustrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/a&e","id":"a&e"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/consultation","id":"consultation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/exhausted","id":"exhausted"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/form%20filling","id":"form filling"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/procedures","id":"procedures"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/seizure","id":"seizure"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waste%20of%20time","id":"waste of time"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1091657","id":"1091657"}]},{"id":1087545,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Caring Staff","body":"Needed to wait for bed but the treatment I received from the ambulance medics & hospital staff were caring.

It was the week before the surgery date but as luck would have it, I had a pre-op assessment team that afternoon.The pre-op assessment team were excellent. Also when I explained the GP conditional treatment offer to them Nurse Charlene offered to make contact with the surgical team to inquire if the intra-muscular steroid injection so close to surgery would be OK. In view of the time-crunch, and the state of me, she stated that she would try to get an answer the following day.  \r\nBefore 10:00 am the next morning nurse Charlene confirmed that the surgical team had given the OK for the intra-muscular steroid injection.

With no hesitation they told us to come through and they would look at her.  \r\nWe arrived at 10.50pm and the doctors were so quick to examine my daughter and then discovered that the pain was possible coming from her ovaries. The staff doctors both doctors on duty were called Laura they said your daughter will be going through to ward 29 and will be going for an ultrasound in the morning @ 10:45am.  \r\nWe moved to ward 29 and the staff were amazing, making sure that my daughter wasn’t in pain and they kept asking if she was ok as they noticed that she was suffering. Later on the gynaecologist came in and said that your daughter has to get surgery as she has cysts on her right ovary which was 9cm and they were concerned so my daughter went for emergency surgery. They were fantastic with my daughter and explained everything what they were going to do, which put my daughter at ease. All the staff in the theatre were amazing also having a laugh singing to Taylor Swift .  \r\n13 days later my daughter was concerned about her stitches so I called ward 30 in the morning they said we’ll have a look for you. The staff, Kelly and her colleagues, were so friendly and looked at my daughters stitches. They trimmed off the tails of her stitches as one of them was slightly embedded into her bellybutton which was causing it to be sore and uncomfortable. They were so professional and talked there way through every step with my daughter. In all ward 29, pau, gynaecology and ward 30 went above and beyond to help my daughter. 🤩🤩  \r\nCan’t say the same for A&E. If this had been noticed on the Wednesday it could have been resolved before the Tuesday the following week .","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-07-03T18:05:06.1066667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-07-05T11:47:41.227","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Tayside","count":15}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1086623","id":"1086623"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1086623/responses","id":"1086623"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1086623/healthservices","id":"1086623"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1086623/tags","id":"1086623"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/t101h_171_w30","id":"T101H_171_w30","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/t101h_180","id":"T101H_180","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/t101h_420_","id":"T101H_420_","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/t101h_420_ward29","id":"T101H_420_ward29","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/t101h_502","id":"T101H_502","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/a&e","id":"a&e"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/abdominal","id":"abdominal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/above%20and%20beyond","id":"above and beyond"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/adrenal","id":"adrenal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing%20staff","id":"amazing staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/concerned","id":"concerned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/congenital","id":"congenital"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctors","id":"doctors"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency%20surgery","id":"emergency surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gynaecology","id":"gynaecology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/paediatrics","id":"paediatrics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professional","id":"professional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/quick%20response","id":"quick response"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/theatre%20staff","id":"theatre staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ultrasound","id":"ultrasound"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing","id":"amazing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fantastic","id":"fantastic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/explanations","id":"explanations"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20at%20ease","id":"put at ease"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1088189","id":"1088189"}]},{"id":1087567,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Great doctor ","body":"The GP was excellent but making an appointment can be difficult , unable to get through on the telephone ","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2023-07-05T11:02:59","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2023-07-05T11:53:14","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1087567","id":"1087567"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1087567/responses","id":"1087567"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1087567/healthservices","id":"1087567"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1087567/tags","id":"1087567"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/y02886","id":"Y02886","score":null}]},{"id":1086626,"author":"Disgusted sane patient","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Lack of stroke care","body":"My MRI results got lost then sent to a unknown doctor that nobody has ever heard of.
