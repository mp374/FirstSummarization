I suffer mental health issues which I’ve found difficult to live with at times. My experience with the practice has been positive from day one. The stigma around mental health does not exist at Kirkburton. The admin team are responsive and compassionate. I don’t feel judged or embarrassed when talking with them. They listen, they offer solutions, they connect you with a doctor or a nurse if necessary, they work very well with the medical staff. Continuity is excellent. They do not pass you from doctor to doctor. I’ve not always been easy to talk to or help (unfortunately my illness can make me ‘hard work’) and the patience of the admin team is worth its weight in gold. The doctors and nurses are consistent and focused, and having continuity with my doctor is hugely important for me, which is something the whole practice works hard to ensure is maintained. My gratitude and appreciation of the office and reception staff, the doctors and nurses, is beyond measure. A brilliant practice staffed by a group of people that definitely place the safety and well being of their patients as their priority, and their understanding and management of mental health within and throughout the practice is outstanding.

The surgery has been cancelled twice in a row, and they literally called me 2h before the appointment time. The reason was the same: the machine has broken. Really? What a coincidence, I must be very unlucky as the machine broke on the specific dates they booked me in. I planned to have the day off, and they gave me very short notice twice.

When rebooked the hospital made a huge data error and had booked in another person with the same name as me and I only found out because the hospital called the optician to check he had referred the correct person!!  \nThe letter that they sent is basic and has none of the new Covid precautions on it, which includes a check at the door and that you shouldn't go wearing your own mask.  I wore my own one and promptly was told to throw it in the bin - what a waste!  If I'd known beforehand I wouldn't have worn it.  Inside the staff were ok, but a bit surly at times, just as a comparison the NHS hospital equivalent are very friendly and polite.  The procedure (YAG) was only done on 1 eye even though the advice of the optician was for both.  Very little in the way of aftercare advice and not given a follow up or check just told to see my optician in around a week.  I sadly cannot recommend this hospital, I realise they are taking on the extra work from the NHS but they do not have the same level of efficiency or care as our wonderful NHS hospitals do.

He spoke to me with respect throughout & listened to everything I had to say, & throughout the conversation I never felt rushed. He courteously corrected my belief that my back pain was due to an injury I had over 40 years ago. This got me thinking in a different way about how to manage my chronic back pain. I have always kept very positive about this pain & over the years learned how to deal with it so that it didn't rule my life . I received a huge amount of information & websites from the team (some of which was a bit heavy going), but some was very good, such as how to desensitize the pain & learning that the pain is very real & not \"in my head\" & that it was due to my nervous system, not the injury.  A further phone call from a different member of the team helped me with the emotional aspect of living with back pain. We got on well. In the mean time a lady phoned to invite me to join a Zoom session which I declined as I couldn't make such a big commitment of a whole morning for 6 weeks. This member of the team was also very kind & caring. My mental attitude improved over the months of lock down mainly due to losing quite a lot of weight, which had a great positive impact on my painful joints. After a follow up phone call I was sent more websites to look at with loads more information & useful exercises. I was again invited to join the Zoom group, but again declined as I felt I didn't really need that level of support. After a final phone it was agreed that I should be discharged, with the understanding that I knew that they would help me in the future, should I need it. It would have been nice to see someone in person, but of course that wasn't possible due to the global situation we all find ourselves in. The only slight negative I found in the short time I spent with the team was that I felt it was all a bit of \" do it yourself\". I am sure this was due to the way they have to work at this time. I am sure that  pre Covid, I wouldn't have felt this way, so this is no reflection on the Team.  I am a positive, active person & am coping. I feel for others that are really struggling with life restricting chronic pain. I hope that are able to cope with this remote way of support. I am sure the team are fully aware of the need for \"face to face\" support & will return to working in this way as soon as they can.  Many thanks to all the team.\nJulie Edge","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-09-10T18:41:25","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2020-09-10T20:21:32","readBy":[{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2021)","count":1},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2020)","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/785740","id":"785740"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/785740/responses","id":"785740"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/785740/healthservices","id":"785740"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/785740/tags","id":"785740"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/ny6","id":"NY6","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nervous","id":"nervous"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back%20pain","id":"back pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/chronic%20back","id":"chronic back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/chronic%20pain","id":"chronic pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/face","id":"face"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good","id":"good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/group","id":"group"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/head","id":"head"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helped","id":"helped"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/injury","id":"injury"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain%20management","id":"pain management"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/positive","id":"positive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/rushed","id":"rushed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/weight","id":"weight"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hope","id":"Hope"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/on%20edge","id":"on edge"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thanks","id":"thanks"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/no%20hope","id":"no hope"}]},{"id":785735,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Very satisfied patient","body":"I have nothing but praise for this surgery.at the way I have been treated at this differcult  time.
