A week ago I was admitted to 5D via casualty with a suspected thrombus in the pump. During my stay in 5D the dressing, on the site where the driveline from the external control/power enters my abdomen, needed changed. This happens every 3 days. This is an important part of infection control. Infection being a significant risk to LVAD patients.  \r\nOn discussing this with the nurse in charge I was told that it would not be possible to change it, as they had not been trained. This despite the fact that there are a number of LVAD patients in Northern Ireland all managed by the Royal Hospital.  \r\nUnder normal circumstances this dressing is replaced by my wife. The nurse asked could my wife come to the hospital and change the dressing? She did.  \r\nThis leads to some questions.  \r\n1. Why has training not been provided given the number of LVAD patients there are, and the fact that this number will only increase?  \r\n2. What would have happened if my wife had not been available, couldn't travel or indeed was self-isolating?  \r\n3. Given that visits to patients are currently restricted to once a week, is the fact that my wife would have had to come in twice a week an increased risk to herself, patients and staff in relation to Covid-19? I should note I was transferred to the Freeman Hospital and this did not occur on this occasion. What happens the next time?  \r\nI have to be honest, I was surprised that the leading cardiology unit in Northern Ireland was in this situation.  \r\nI have some reservations about these comments in that I was probably the only LVAD patient in recently, and therefore could be easily identified. In addition, I again want to emphasise that otherwise care was of the expected high standard.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-10-13T13:38:10.6766667","progress":"Change planned","dateOfPublication":"2020-10-15T09:20:02.863","readBy":[{"name":"Belfast Health and Social Care Trust","count":12},{"name":"Public Health Agency","count":3}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/794966","id":"794966"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/794966/responses","id":"794966"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/794966/healthservices","id":"794966"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/794966/tags","id":"794966"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt001_11021_320","id":"ZT001_11021_320","score":5},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt001_1102-ccu","id":"ZT001_1102-ccu","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cardiology","id":"cardiology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dressing%20change","id":"dressing change"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/infection","id":"infection"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20training","id":"staff training"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care%20from%20individual%20nurses","id":"care from individual nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/suprised","id":"suprised"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/796777","id":"796777"}]},{"id":795545,"author":"cheetahks77","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"All staff very cheerful","body":"This hospital is a credit to the NHS.

There is no known cure for this but here I'am mid April still hoping that things will change. I'am now at home and due to a change in my health recently was offered through my GP the services of HHS. I had three separate visits from nurses Nancy and Jennifer and a telephone call from DR Boyce during which my case was fully discussed in regard to the reason for the visit. The result was a change in medication the effects of which are yet to be analysed after 4 weeks. Both nurses were very friendly caring and extremely efficient. They each understood my case and undertook appropriate tests, made all the more difficult for them under the constraints of the PPE required under the pandemic rules.  \r\nThe doctor fully discussed with me my condition and arranged for a new approach having regard to the health issues prevailing at the time.I have since been formally discharged from HHS care and handed back to my GP.  \r\nI have nothing but admiration for the interest and dedication shown to me by these professionals during their short time with me and it certainly has given me a re-assurance to continue with a positive outlook -all is not necessarily lost. It also has given support to the equally wonderful efforts of my GP Dr Downey who has cared for me since the outset of leaving Edinburgh Royal and continues to do so.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-10-15T09:19:18.9733333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-10-15T09:33:27.847","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lothian","count":7}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/795554","id":"795554"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/795554/responses","id":"795554"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/795554/healthservices","id":"795554"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/795554/tags","id":"795554"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/s9-midlothian-hath","id":"s9-midlothian-hath","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/ss9","id":"SS9","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bladder","id":"bladder"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20about","id":"Cared about"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gall","id":"gall"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gall%20bladder","id":"gall bladder"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gall%20bladder%20removal","id":"Gall bladder removal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pancreatitis","id":"pancreatitis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/positive","id":"positive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tests","id":"tests"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/the%20change","id":"the change"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20for","id":"cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wonderful","id":"wonderful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/admiration","id":"admiration"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pandemic","id":"pandemic"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/796189","id":"796189"}]},{"id":795555,"author":"leathergt69","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"My accident and recovery","body":"I had an accident which resulted in a head injury.

I am aware of the problems with this over the years with and how it has been an ongoing issue but after all this time there is still no solution.  \r\nI am a full time worker and the appointment system currently in place gives me no scope to phone into the surgery between the allocated time frame of 8-10am. I am unable to call from work due to my profession as I work within the hospital setting and cannot take lengthy breaks to enable me to call. I have been able to work round this previously when the afternoon triage line was also available. I understand the reason this was implemented as it’s less wasted appointments and works well to an extent. The frustration I have is with non urgent concerns or minor issues that need treated.  \r\nI am aware that any urgent concerns I wouldn’t be fit for work and therefore could phone the practice easily. I have a long term health condition which I rely on my Gp practice at times to assist with minor problems due to this. I have occasionally phoned out with the time frame and been told by reception staff that they are unable to help and I need to call back within the allocated time. This is no fault of theirs I know, but it is so very frustrating and often not helped by staff attitude towards the situation.  \r\nI would like to know if the practice are any further forward with a better approach to their appointment system and how patients should go about non urgent concerns that require Gp/ANP input.  \r\nI want to also state that this feedback isn’t purely negative, there has been many occasions where I have found the practice to be efficient and helpful but since taking the PM triage service away and there being no option to book appointments in advance I have recently felt frustrated with the ongoing issue.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-10-13T17:05:18.2566667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-10-15T12:16:35.88","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lanarkshire","count":2},{"name":"Office of Colin Smyth, MSP for South Scotland","count":1},{"name":"South Lanarkshire Health and Social Care Forum","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/794995","id":"794995"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/794995/responses","id":"794995"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/794995/healthservices","id":"794995"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/794995/tags","id":"794995"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sl9-gp","id":"sl9-gp","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frustrated","id":"frustrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appointment%20system","id":"appointment system"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/efficient","id":"efficient"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helpful","id":"helpful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/triage","id":"triage"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/796852","id":"796852"}]},{"id":788118,"author":"pnh1967","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Repeat prescriptions and increased anxiety","body":"I have been taking consultant prescribed medication for a number of years, since this at one time ensured that you were not getting generic medication, and that my GP surgery could not stop me getting the correct repeat medication.  \r\nThis problem has been going on since 1996, but over the years it is just how the practice operates.

Much worse having to contact them by phone as constantly engaged, and anxiety levels massive when they call back.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-09-21T22:09:49.72","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2020-10-15T12:20:00.713","readBy":[{"name":"Kings medical students, 2020","count":1},{"name":"Public Health Agency","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/788118","id":"788118"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/788118/responses","id":"788118"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/788118/healthservices","id":"788118"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/788118/tags","id":"788118"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/nigp-ps6094","id":"nigp-ps6094","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxious","id":"anxious"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scared","id":"scared"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cbt","id":"cbt"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/repeat%20prescription","id":"repeat prescription"}]},{"id":789623,"author":"In it together","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Feeling safe and cared for","body":"I recently attended North Parade GP practice, just off the Ormeau Road Belfast, for a series of tests.  \r\nMy experience was first class from start to finish.

I was given very clear instructions about how to access the surgery given the COVID situation which I followed.  \r\nI attended the surgery which was so well organised in terms of protecting the patients attending. This included patients not meeting each other in the corridor, ongoing cleaning and socially distanced seating. I had an appointment with the practice nurse then the GP immediately after.

I developed a small blister on my right ear and was referred to the Maxcillo facial clinic at Lincoln hospital. The consultant confirmed it was skin cancer and that they would cut out the blister and pull the skin over...I would never know I had had it done.  \r\nDuring the course of the next 18 months my notes were lost at least twice, my surgical referral was lost,2 junior doctors completely discharged me by accident. During this time telephone contact was impossible as by their own admittance when it got busy they turned the phones off.  \r\nEventually after 18 months a rather shocked surgeon removed half my ear. When I returned 2 months later for what I thought would be the promised reconstruction surgery I was told they had not removed all the cancer and I needed another operation to remove more of my ear.  \r\nA month ago I got a call from The Pilgrim Hospital Boston who are now handling my case to say the telephone consultation could not go ahead as they could not find my notes!  \r\nThis week I had a telephone consultation from doctor at Boston telling me no reconstruction and my case was being signed off.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-10-13T18:15:31.8833333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-10-15T12:23:50.8","readBy":[{"name":"United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust","count":3},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2021)","count":1},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2020)","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/794996","id":"794996"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/794996/responses","id":"794996"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/794996/healthservices","id":"794996"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/794996/tags","id":"794996"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rwdda_144","id":"RWDDA_144","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rwdla_160","id":"RWDLA_160","score":2},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/shocked","id":"shocked"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cancer","id":"cancer"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ear","id":"ear"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/follow%20up","id":"follow up"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hospital%20discharge","id":"hospital discharge"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kept%20informed","id":"kept informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/operation","id":"operation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reconstruction","id":"reconstruction"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/renal","id":"renal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/skin%20cancer","id":"skin cancer"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/transplant","id":"Transplant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blessed","id":"blessed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/contactable","id":"contactable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lost%20notes","id":"lost notes"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/conflicting%20information","id":"conflicting information"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/795910","id":"795910"}]},{"id":794997,"author":"Oban123","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Oban midwives","body":"I really want to sing the praises of Oban maternity unit midwives and staff.  \r\nThis was my second pregnancy.

Quickly seen by doctor for initial assessment and then sent for blood test and then to last slot for ultrasound. Aster this a long wait for a final visit to a doctor as I am not an urgent case. He was a scream, and I know that my situation caused some concern, as not a straight forward case. Then seen by senior doctor and finally away after 4 hours which I had allocated anyway. At every stage the staff gave their name or had a badge clearly showing their name, and were friendly. I was surprised how empty the waiting area was on arrival at 2.30 pm and the effort to get me seen quickly was appreciated. Quickly moved from staff to staff, and each stage the process was explained. The waiting area on first floor whilst marked out for social distancing leaves little space for waiting and some people had to stand. I learned a lot from the doctor who gave me some very interesting facts about previous problems which could have caused the present problem and he was happy to get a second opinion which gave me some useful information.\nAs I had the last ultrasound appointment at 3.30 pm what happens to patients coming in later - surely this service should be available 24 hours?\nThe only person to offer any criticism was when i came in through the entrance and the person handling this asked me to adjust my mask which I had lowered as they could not understand what I said.

Online queries are dealt with relatively promptly. \n\nHowever the phone message received when phoning the practice commences with a doctor stating that you must (with emphasis on this word) contact the practice online, presumably a message recorded at the height of the pandemic. If you hold, you do get through to reception but that initial phrase can be very disconcerting for anyone without access to the internet or who is not IT literate and might well make them end the call. Rephrasing this as a request but then saying to hold for an operator where needed would be more encouraging to patients, particularly those in an anxious or emotional state because of illness.\n\nThe website in its new form has no information about staff, either in words or pictures. In an age of medical concern and when people look for transparency, this does not inspire confidence when it is not known who the practice staff are. A small photo, brief biography and role in the organisation would be very welcome. Other public services do this and it would be good for the practice and its patients to include this information on the website.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-10-15T08:46:11","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-10-15T13:29:08","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/795613","id":"795613"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/795613/responses","id":"795613"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/795613/healthservices","id":"795613"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/795613/tags","id":"795613"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/h81033","id":"H81033","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxious","id":"anxious"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/concern","id":"concern"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/face","id":"face"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good","id":"good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/infection","id":"infection"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/safe","id":"safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/welcome","id":"welcome"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confidence","id":"confidence"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/no%20confidence","id":"no confidence"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/796108","id":"796108"}]},{"id":795016,"author":"Mcquade365","authorRoleId":1,"authorRole":"a carer","title":"My dad's flu vaccination","body":"I attended Udston hospital with my dad for his flu vaccination in October 2020.

Trying to get an appointment with the doctor is ridiculous the receptionists think they know best and try to redirect you to anywhere but the surgery, including the pharmacy, specs savers. No matter how many times you insist you need an appointment they’re not interested. When you do keep on insisting you may be lucky to see a nurse.\nAlso if you’re in the middle of treatment you need to keep on following up because they forget things like blood tests, I even booked a telephone appointment and this was totally forgotten and I had to telephone the next day and ask why nobody called me.\nAnother thing they’ve started doing rather than calling you sending you a text and asking you to call them which clogs up the phone lines and means that nobody can ever get through.\nI try not to use any of the services unless it’s really important I sit here ill because I can’t be bothered to go through all the performance of trying to get an appointment with someone and having to tell the receptionist my personal situation. It’s such a shame as the surgery used to be very good but I struggle every time I have to use any of the services. I’ve also been told by the surgery before if you don’t like it maybe you could find somewhere that’s more suited to you. Why should I have to find somewhere when all I’m asking for is a professional competent service by my nearest healthcare facility.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-10-15T09:10:51","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-10-15T13:36:19","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/795621","id":"795621"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/795621/responses","id":"795621"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/795621/healthservices","id":"795621"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/795621/tags","id":"795621"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/f81052","id":"F81052","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood","id":"blood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20tests","id":"blood tests"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/forgotten","id":"forgotten"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good","id":"good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/important","id":"important"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lucky","id":"lucky"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pharmacy","id":"Pharmacy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tests","id":"tests"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/795777","id":"795777"}]},{"id":795622,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Awful reception staff ","body":"There have been times I have been left in tears after speaking to the reception staff at the practice.

Unfortunately he broke his hip. The emergency services were very good, especially in these difficult times with the virus straining resources. His experience in Queen Elisabeth University Hospital, where he was operated upon, wasn’t great mainly thru severe post-op delirium and the fact that no-one was allowed to visit (which caused him real anxiety). After a week he was moved to Gartnavel Hospital to recuperate and things started to improve immediately.  \r\nFrom the start at Gartnavel the communication from the ward - 3A - was excellent. They recognised immediately that my dad needed some contact with the family and, as the oldest son and Power of Attorney, I was the designated visitor. From stories told by my dad as well as my own experience on visits over 10 days, I cannot speak highly enough of the staff on the ward. Each time I visited there was a friendly greeting as I checked-in, followed by a detailed update on my dads progress. It was excellent.  \r\nMy dad reported that the attention from the nursing staff was first class and he really enjoyed the quality and quantity of food. Throughout I had a direct phone line to the ward should I need to contact them. The staff were very hard-working and deserve great credit for dealing so well with so many older people who often create great challenges.  \r\nI was well-briefed by the staff on discharge too which was very helpful and put our minds at rest during a stressful time.  \r\nWell done to all involved. This feels like a TripAdviser review - all I can say is that I wouldn’t wish a hospital stay on anyone, but if you had to, then ward 3A at Gartnavel would be an excellent place to go.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-10-13T22:20:51.24","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-10-15T13:57:44.557","readBy":[{"name":"Yorkshire & Humber Patient Safety Research Collaboration","count":1},{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":3},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":1},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2020)","count":1},{"name":"Scottish Government","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/795087","id":"795087"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/795087/responses","id":"795087"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/795087/healthservices","id":"795087"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/795087/tags","id":"795087"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/g505h-elderly-medicine","id":"g505h-elderly-medicine","score":5},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sj9-orthopaedics","id":"SJ9-orthopaedics","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxious","id":"anxious"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/attention","id":"attention"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency","id":"emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fall","id":"fall"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/food","id":"food"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/food%20portions","id":"food portions"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good","id":"good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hard%20working","id":"hard working"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helpful","id":"helpful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hip","id":"hip"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hospital%20discharge","id":"hospital discharge"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/knowledgeable","id":"knowledgeable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/visiting","id":"visiting"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/valued","id":"valued"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/contactable","id":"contactable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/family%20kept%20informed","id":"family kept informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20ease","id":"at ease"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/post%20op%20delirium","id":"post op delirium"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/795982","id":"795982"}]},{"id":795633,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Reliable practice","body":"Although current restrictions can make booking appointments a bit tedious (long hold times etc) my overall recent experience has been positive.

Then there was Kathy who really got me sorted both times I stayed and I can’t thank her enough.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-10-14T13:55:30.07","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-10-15T15:06:29.16","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Fife","count":16},{"name":"Fife Health & Social Care Partnership","count":2},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/795283","id":"795283"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/795283/responses","id":"795283"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/795283/healthservices","id":"795283"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/795283/tags","id":"795283"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/f704h_110","id":"F704H_110","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/continuity%20of%20care","id":"continuity of care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/experience","id":"experience"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kindness","id":"kindness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/positive","id":"positive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attitude","id":"staff attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/welcome","id":"welcome"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/welcoming","id":"welcoming"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing","id":"amazing"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/795952","id":"795952"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/796092","id":"796092"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/797992","id":"797992"}]},{"id":792230,"author":"Transparency advocate","authorRoleId":4,"authorRole":"a relative","title":"Diagnosis discrimination and abdication of duty of care","body":"My husband had a covid positive swab in September 2020 he gradually began to deteriorate at home mainly with dehydration initially. I have his full consent to tell our story on CO.  \r\nOur GP practice (Westbourne Medical Center, Bournemouth refused a telephone consultation and sent a message via the receptionist to say phone 111 they are the experts. We have raised a complaint with the practice manager however wanted transparency in sharing our story for other service users. We cannot begin to imagine what it would be like for other families who do not have a family member with medical knowledge trying to access help for a sick person and being inappropriately sign posted via a receptionist.  \r\nIn this climate of the pandemic uncertainty and anxiety we all accept services are limited with little or no face to face contact with our GP’s. The very least we can expect is a telephone consultation with a prescribing professional in order to discuss and manage symptoms and work towards prevention of hospital admissions, regardless of diagnosis. Our practice states on their website around covid, that telephone consultations are available for advice.  \r\nThree days after testing positive, 08:30 am.  \r\nOn day 6 of my husbands symptoms (no breathing difficulty) and deterioration, mainly dehydration, dizziness/nausea and acute pyrexia/rigours – I called the surgery to request a telephone consultation.  \r\nI was seeking validation of my concerns from a professional that was not emotionally invested and perhaps try anti emetics to manage nausea and enable him to take fluids. I also wanted to rule out a source of infection, a possible UTI/sepsis.  \r\nThe receptionist (who was very professional and polite) asked what was it about. I firstly said he had tested Covid Positive, as an aid for staff to triage any urgency and same day consultation, and briefly outlined my concerns wishing to speak more in depth with a GP/nurse practitioner.  \r\nThe receptionist said hold the line and they would go and speak to them, returning to say “They said ring 111 because they are the experts.” I could not believe “they” had said that, I was seeking advice and support re symptoms not Covid advice or testing.  \r\nThe receptionist was very apologetic and said they were just relaying the message they had been given.  \r\nI firmly believe “Covid Positive” was the only message heard by “them” whoever they were, and this was the Diagnosis Discrimination and abdication of duty of care by inappropriately sign posting to 111. I may have accepted it if I had the courtesy of a phone consult with a GP and they, after discussion felt it was appropriate to signpost to 111.  \r\nI rang 111, as you know this takes a very long time to get through, I went through the standard Algorithm with the call handler – they spoke to my husband and we were not surprisingly told to phone our GP.  \r\n111 were amazing and took pity on us, apparently GP's signposting to 111 inappropriately is not an uncommon occurrence and a clinician called us back - he spoke to my husband at length about fluid intake.  \r\nThe next day.  \r\nI sent an email at 6 am to patient contact requesting a telephone consult with a GP, outlined concerns putting symptoms first and Covid positive almost as a footnote. my husband was deteriorating further and faster.  \r\n12 midday – 30 hours after attempting to initially speak to a GP.  \r\nI received a call from a GP (sorry I didn’t absorb their name at the time) in response to the email request. Although lovely and helpful, they were very concerned and anxious about his symptoms.  \r\nThey asked me if I was aware of how serious dehydration was? I recall saying yes, seizures, heart failure, kidney failure and that’s why I phoned the day before and was told to ring 111. This made me feel that I had been the one delaying seeking help.  \r\nI said his symptoms had worsened since then and he was very unwell. This GP spoke briefly to my husband gaining consent to talk to me. They stressed that they would prescribe the anti-emetics but strongly advised I call for a paramedic assessment.  \r\n13.30 following trying anti- emetics I called for a paramedic assessment. He was admitted to hospital.  \r\nCould this have been avoided had we had the courtesy of a phone consult with the GP 30 hours previously? possibly/possibly not as we all know Covid is unpredictable and somewhat a silent assassin.  \r\nThere was no follow up call from the GP to ensure I had called for paramedic assessment.  \r\nThe paramedic service (south Western Ambulance) was outstanding, after I initially did the 999 call I received a call from a paramedic lead - he was calm, reassuring, we talked through all the symptoms I was concerned about and he validated the concerns and what a plan of care may look like after the crew had assessed.. He did not question whether I knew the consequences of the symptoms.  \r\nThe crew that arrived a male and female were equally amazing, calm, measured assessment approach, obviously dressed in full PPE. They showed exceptional skills in managing what is a potentially a highly charged situation, with a wife who hadn't slept for 4 nights giving regular care and a very sick husband not knowing how he would respond in hospital and whether we would see each other again.  \r\nThat day My husband was admitted to A4 Arne in Poole Hospital via the A&E assessment area for Covid patients. We are very thank full for the care he received on his Poole Hospital Journey. He said they were prepared, professional, efficient, they kept him informed at all times and provided exceptional care as a team. He was recruited to a Covid Recovery study which not only was he committed to do his bit for society, it also meant that professionals would be monitoring him for 10 years as we cannot rely on even a phone consult from our GP practice.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-10-04T15:02:03.6","progress":"Story

under the Mental Health Act several weeks ago.  \r\nMy first psychiatry meeting was held on the first day I was admitted to hospital.  \r\nIn my first psychiatry meeting in hospital, I expected to be seen by a psychiatrist and a nurse alone.  \r\nHowever, when I walked into the meeting room, I saw eight people sitting in a meeting room waiting for me, including a psychiatrist, a trainee doctor who was responsible to take notes, another trainee doctor, a nurse, another nurse, a student nurse, a pharmacist and a trainee pharmacist (?). I was absolutely overwhelmed to be greeted by so many health care professionals.  \r\nDuring the meeting, the psychiatrist talked about the reason why I was there, my diagnoses and the treatment plan in details in front of trainee doctors, nurses, and pharmacists. The psychiatrist also asked me to talk about my thoughts in details in front of them, I was extremely unease to talk about self-harm, overdosed and suicidal thought in front of other seven strangers at the time.  \r\nI was very upset and distressed after the meeting, I was like I was not being treated with the dignity and respect I should expect when I was in crisis.  \r\nDays later, Helen who is an Independent Mental Health Advocate (IMHA) of Advocacy Support Cymru (ASC), introduced herself to me on the ward.  \r\nI told Helen I was extremely distressed and traumatized after the first meeting. She listened to my views and concerns, and she explained to me what are my options and rights in a psychiatric hospital. To help me stand up for my rights and speak for me, Helen promised me she could accompany me and support me in my next meeting with the psychiatrist and other health care professionals.  \r\nHelen is brilliant! She is very competent and experienced advocate, and she takes things seriously.  \r\nI find it extremely helpful to have Helen to stand up for my rights and speak for me, particularly in a meeting with a psychiatrist. By doing so, it makes me feel less worried of being misunderstood or having my concerns dismissed by the psychiatrist.  \r\nI highly recommend you to have an advocate to stand up for your rights and speak for you! And please do not miss it when the opportunity arises!  \r\nThank you Helen, for everything you have done to me 😊.  \r\n","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-10-15T01:12:56.2133333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-10-15T15:23:20.81","readBy":[{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2020)","count":1},{"name":"Advocacy Support Cymru","count":7},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2022)","count":1},{"name":"Kings medical students, 2020","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/795387","id":"795387"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/795387/responses","id":"795387"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/795387/healthservices","id":"795387"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/795387/tags","id":"795387"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/advocacy-support-cymru","id":"advocacy-support-cymru","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/advocate","id":"advocate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/brilliant","id":"brilliant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/competent%20staff","id":"Competent staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/delighted","id":"delighted"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/experienced%20staff","id":"experienced staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helpful","id":"helpful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/overdose","id":"overdose"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/overjoyed","id":"overjoyed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/self%20harm","id":"self harm"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/suicidal","id":"suicidal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supportive","id":"supportive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/taken%20seriously","id":"taken seriously"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dignity","id":"Dignity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/explanations","id":"explanations"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/less%20worried","id":"less worried"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/796943","id":"796943"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/797564","id":"797564"}]},{"id":795290,"author":"Keefy","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"My care during recent operation","body":"I was obviously nervous booking into the Sandbourne Suite, to prepare for a gall bladder removal operation.
