I am due to register with an NHS dentist in a few days (after a 7 week wait), but they wouldn't assist, and I was advised to contact NHS 111.  My initial enquiries with them began at 3.15pm by telephone. After 20 minutes wait I was stationery in a queue at position 10, and was showing little sign of progressing up the chain.\nThe 111 recorded message which looped every few minutes suggested completing the enquiry online, so I did that.\nI was prepared for a lengthy delay for a call back (due to the interminable 'large volume of calls' situation), but I did get one from a nurse after just over an hour.\nI was triaged at that point, and it was decided that my details would be passed to my area dental on call service, where I was once again triaged from a dental point of view. This resulted in my details being passed on to my local emergency health care centre, and I was triaged once more before being allocated an emergency dental appointment for 7.30pm.\nBeing triaged 3 times might be seen as being a bit of a bind, especially trying to speak with acute mouth pain, but I do get the rationale behind it. The NHS needed to ensure both mine and their staff's safety as regards to Covid, and they also needed to be 100% certain that I would get the right treatment, and they also needed to confirm that my pain was acute enough to require the emergency dental service. \nI have nothing but praise for the attention I received. I do get the numerous complaints from other service users, and they clearly highlight some areas where the NHS 111 service needs some rapid, and meaningful attention. \nHowever, my experience, despite being one I could have quite happily done without, was one that I wanted to highlight as being worthy of praise.\nIt took just over 4 hours from my initial call, to being sat in a dentist's chair having a tooth extracted.  \nWe are extremely fortunate to have the NHS, despite the 'beancounters' doing their best to run it into the ground.\nYes, it does have a lot of problems, but when the system works, it works well. \n","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2021-10-19T16:06:37","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-10-20T07:45:49","readBy":[{"name":"Integrated Care 24","count":2},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2021)","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/888153","id":"888153"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/888153/responses","id":"888153"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/888153/healthservices","id":"888153"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/888153/tags","id":"888153"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/nve","id":"NVE","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dental","id":"dental"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency","id":"emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fortunate","id":"fortunate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tooth","id":"tooth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid","id":"covid"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%2019","id":"covid 19"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/893071","id":"893071"}]},{"id":888152,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Phone line","body":"Would just like to say how bad your phone lines are, I was in queue for 40 mins and then again for another 30.

Within one week I had an ultrasound in Stirling Health & Care Village, which was followed up with a flexible cystoscopy at Forth Valley Royal Hospital by the most amazing Urology Nurse Specialist, Leanne , who identified a tumour and offered spectacularly good care managing the shock of cancer. I was in the Care of Mr. Tweedle and his staff for a Trans Urethral Resection of a bladder tumour (TURBT) procedure and chemotherapy only two weeks later. Pathology news was again delivered by Leanne with care and consideration indicating I had a high grade tumour and would need further procedures. I had a second TURBT procedure six weeks later under the Care of Mr. McIlhenny and I am please to say Leanne was able to offer good news with pathology this time around as the tumour had been removed in its entirety. Next stage for me is immunotherapy with the BCG vaccine.  \r\nI have gone from having little interaction with the NHS beyond local GP led care to having undergone an Ultrasound scan, a flexible cystoscopy. two TURBT procedures, two epidurals, chemotherapy a CT scan and chest x-ray, all within three months.  \r\nI now have a care package which includes 3 years of immunotherapy, 5 years of CT scans and 10 years of cystoscopy surveillance. I cannot fathom the cost to our NHS for my care. It is clear the NHS is incredible value for money.  \r\nHaving gotten in to my fifties with no invasive procedures to then have the shock that I would be getting a camera and surgical tools pushed through the relatively small hole of my urethra filled me with dread. The reality was quite the opposite, I encountered the most considerate and caring professionals I could ever have hoped for. I had the absolute treat of being able to watch my tumour being resected \"live\" as I had a spinal and was awake throughout the procedure! At every touch point the care was exceptional from Consultants, Anesthetists, Practitioners, Nurses, Auxiliaries and support staff. Interestingly I though my tumour would be dark and sinister but it proved to be quite pretty a bit like a sea anemone. My wife named my tumour Twoey (Audrey II) after the main protagonist in the \"Little Shop of Horrors\" musical, an alien with a need for human blood. This really helped manage the mental stress of the \"C\" word in a typically disparaging Scottish way.  \r\nI have nothing but praise for the staff and the Institution of Forth Valley NHS, and if truth be tole have a bit of a man crush on the consultant urologists, I am in absolute awe at the skills needed to conduct a procedure, through my urethra to remove a cancerous tumour. It may seem a bit incredulous that I am looking forward to immunotherapy but the fact is I have a high grade cancer which has been caught early and with immunotherapy the chances of keeping my bladder are very good, and I must say I am pretty fond of by bladder. I am now in receipt of the best care and surveillance possible for the next 10 years.  \r\nThe NHS may be used as a political football, but when push come to shove the NHS is always there as the cornerstone of society, looking after all of us in our time of need.  \r\nThankyou so much to all the staff at Forth Valley Royal Hospital for your spectacular care and to the institution of the NHS. I know Scotland had a tradition of health care before Nye Bevan's formation of the NHS, but the NHS should be treasured for all the good it does.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-10-18T15:54:10.42","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-10-20T08:47:11.73","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Forth Valley","count":7},{"name":"Scottish Government","count":1},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2021)","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/887472","id":"887472"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/887472/responses","id":"887472"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/887472/healthservices","id":"887472"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/887472/tags","id":"887472"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/forth-valley-royal-urology","id":"forth-valley-royal-urology","score":5},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sv9-stirling-xray","id":"sv9-stirling-xray","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/above%20and%20beyond","id":"above and beyond"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/attitude","id":"attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bladder","id":"bladder"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bladder%20cancer","id":"bladder cancer"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cancer","id":"cancer"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cancer%20care","id":"cancer care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/car%20parking","id":"car parking"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/chemotherapy","id":"chemotherapy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/chest","id":"chest"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/considerate","id":"considerate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ct%20scan","id":"CT scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cystoscopy","id":"cystoscopy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dedication","id":"dedication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/empathy","id":"empathy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/exceptional%20care","id":"Exceptional care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good%20humour","id":"good humour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kind%20staff","id":"kind staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/safe","id":"safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tumour","id":"Tumour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ultrasound","id":"ultrasound"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/urologist","id":"urologist"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/urology","id":"urology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confident","id":"confident"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported","id":"supported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thorough%20assessment","id":"thorough assessment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/immunotherapy","id":"immunotherapy"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/889363","id":"889363"}]},{"id":887471,"author":"Robbiedino","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"A recent visit","body":"Visited surgery ,met with Dr Don ,received excellent service was ,referred to homerton hospital for tests.

The doctor was very kind and he called my daughter to explain as I knew I wouldn’t have remembered everything.  \r\nI was then moved to male medical and the staff here are brilliant. All the staff from the nurses, HCA’s catering, domestics and Doctors are very friendly and caring. The nurses in this ward call my daughter regularly with an update which is good as she cannot visit and she would be worried otherwise. The physio’s have been helping me get back on my feet again and they are very encouraging and I can feel my confidence building every day.

It all started off smoothly then I had a few complications due to my daughter being stressed with contractions and moving from pelvis. I can not fault the care I received from whole midwife and doctor team in the Labour ward, they acted quick and again I was made aware of exactly what was happening at all times. The care I received from Sharon who also helped during my sons birth 15 months previously was also exactly what myself and daughter needed and I believe it was her care and experience that helped me avoid needing an emergency Caesarean.  \r\nFor the remainder of my Labour I was supported and helped by Sophie - I honestly don’t think I could of done it without her help. The staff at Aberdeen Maternity Labour ward are amazing at there job. I have had 2 very different birth experiences in this ward now - spontaneous birth and also a planned induction.

Then had further contact by the team mid afternoon advising that surgery would now not take place that day and that a member of the team would contact me on Sunday evening with the likely event that surgery would take place on Monday.  \r\nNo contact was made by anyone on Sunday evening so therefore I fasted in preparation for surgery on Monday but still had no communication regarding any planned surgery. I had no information of who to contact to discuss so therefore had to make contact through the fracture clinic at Hairmyres Hospital to be put in touch with the trauma liaison team WGH where I spoke with charge nurse who told me that contact would be made later in the day when the theatre list had been prepared for the next day. I went on to make a further telephone call that evening as I still had received no communication and was told again at that time that there would be contact made when the theatre list had been prepared. I was later contacted by a nurse who advised me that there was no plan for my surgery the next day and that they were unable to confirm when this would take place and that it was a case of waiting on them making contact the night before when they would advise me to fast, this could be 2 days away.  \r\nI felt let down, extremely anxious and unsure where to turn for help.  \r\nI myself work for the NHS and given the current staffing shortage I would have thought that a valuable staff member being treated in a timely manner allowing me to recover and return to work sooner would be beneficial to NHS Lanarkshire.  \r\nAs an NHS nurse I am disappointed to see the poor communication to a patient suffering from the distress and pain of a traumatic accident with no indication after a week as to when treatment might be given.

I had spoken to my community Midwife previously and she had advised me against it, but now all of a sudden I'm told it’s perfectly safe. The consultant could have at least waited before I fully closed to door before making his rude comments. I am sick of the feeling of being pushed from pillar to post. Supporting mother’s to be, I don't feel supported. I feel there's a lack of support and feel some of my concerns are dismissed.  \r\nI had preeclampsia with my first son and was continually dismissed until late into my pregnancy and ended up in a hypertensive state before my son was delivered. Nearly costing us both our lives and lack of communication is the answer i was given for why it happened. I had to sort my own scan appointment today as the wrong date was given.

All of the staff from the domestics, nurses and doctors showed such empathy, kindness and support and made a terrifying experience as a parent, so much easier to process. I could see how busy the ward was during our stay but I never once felt that my son was not a priority and any buzzer calls were answered with a smile (even my multiple calls for trips to the stereliser!).  \r\nAll of the nurses involved in my sons care were fantastic and I can't fault any of the staff, however there were a few that I feel deserve particular recognition including Sharon, Jackie and Alison. Sharon was an absolute hero during our time in the hospital and really made sure my husband and I knew what was going on and why and showed such care to our son that we always felt in safe hands. Sharon has a lovely nature and you can tell she loves her job. I've never seen someone juggle as much as she did and never made us feel like a burden. We will forever be grateful for Sharon. Jackie similarly was our night shift star and was so on the ball and gentle with our son but also to a sleep deprived and worried parent, bringing tea and checking I had everything I needed. Jackie kept me going through the tough nights and she really does prove that nursing is a calling and she is so great at it. Alison again showed such care to our family and reguarly popped her head in to check how we were doing and offer words of reasurrance, even though she was not directly in charge of our care. The paediatric doctors, Sophie and Dr Watson, were also very thorough in their care and Sophie particularly had such a kind, caring and gentle mannerism when assessing our son and was very patient with any questions we had.  \r\nThe NHS has been a tough place to work, particularly over the last few years, but the childrens ward staff are an excellent example of how great our NHS staff are and I can't thank the ward and all the staff enough.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-10-18T21:03:01.7766667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-10-20T11:13:47.85","readBy":[{"name":"Sheffield Hallam University, Nursing BSc (21-9)","count":1},{"name":"NHS Forth Valley","count":6},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2021)","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/887619","id":"887619"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/887619/responses","id":"887619"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/887619/healthservices","id":"887619"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/887619/tags","id":"887619"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/forth-valley-royal-children","id":"forth-valley-royal-children","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/assessments","id":"assessments"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breathing","id":"breathing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bronchiolitis","id":"bronchiolitis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/empathy","id":"empathy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fantastic%20care","id":"fantastic care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/informed","id":"informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kind","id":"kind"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kindness","id":"kindness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/paediatric","id":"paediatric"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/priority","id":"priority"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/safe","id":"safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/response%20to%20buzzers","id":"response to buzzers"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/questions%20answered","id":"questions answered"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gentle%20manner","id":"gentle manner"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/rsv","id":"rsv"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/889410","id":"889410"}]},{"id":887751,"author":"I Never Complained","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Thanks to All of the Staff","body":"I was recovering from an aaa operation.

Ongoing nightmare","body":"In March 2020 l attended the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley. Right at the time visitors were stopped from seeing their loved ones due to Covid.  \r\nI was admitted for an \"exploratory\" on my bowel after a CT scan at another hospital showed a problem. It has only taken them (the NHS) nearly 60 years for my lifelong \"Colic\" issue to finally be taken seriously. I now have an ileostomy. I woke up the next morning after my exploratory with an ileostomy, a bag, a \"stoma\". To be quite honest 1000 characters is by no way means enough to even start with my complaints about my treatment at this hospital and it's staff. I swear l don't even know where to begin to start to tell you about this place. The care (or lack of therein) I received from the nurses, to the wards, to my surgery, to my surgeon to my after care nurse ...my supposed \"5 day hospital stay\"... that ended up an 18 day stay due to the surgeon's mistakes and then a truly horrendous infection due to my aftercare (again... or lack of)... to trying to get help, answers, diagnosis and finally... how to go about getting another surgeon who will do a reversal on my ileostomy as my surgeon is not willing to do one...  \r\nl was told that after 12 months l could have a reversal. Goal posts have been changed due to... yes, you guessed it, Covid. I feel like COVID has been their excuse for everything. Im now 19 months down the line...my surgeon keeps changing the goal-posts. My ileostomy nurse refuses to contact me and in the one recent email when l contacted them with a problem, the response back was one sentence, saying to ask my GP for an urgent referral.l have basically been left on my own, left to my own devices. Left to try and figure out where to get answers. Left to deal with this lifechanging ileostomy with no backup. No aftercare. No helpline. No apology for a lifetime being told l had \"colic\" only to be informed recently by my GP \"you do realise that you were misdiagnosed as having colic when your whole life it indeed appears you had Crohn's disease\" ?? Where do l start ? I can count on one hand on how many times l have left my home in the last 19 months...leaving your home with a stoma is a nightmare for obvious reasons.Finally...For three years of my life from 2006 to 2009 l was misdiagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer. I was told by the oncologist at the time l had a \"fatty lump\"...l survived that with very little help from those professionals.Thank god for the AMAZING Beatson cancer hospital in Glagow. As you have probably gathered...l'm ever so slightly bitter and twisted about my experiences.I will not go any further...but l probably think you get the gist ??Thank you for reading","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-10-16T14:43:21.3333333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-10-20T11:28:49.65","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":13}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/887156","id":"887156"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/887156/responses","id":"887156"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/887156/healthservices","id":"887156"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/887156/tags","id":"887156"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/c418h-gastroenterology","id":"c418h-gastroenterology","score":1},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lack%20of%20care","id":"Lack of care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/aftercare","id":"aftercare"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bowel","id":"bowel"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/colic","id":"colic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/crohn's","id":"Crohn's"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ct","id":"ct"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ct%20scan","id":"CT scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diagnosis","id":"diagnosis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/help","id":"help"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ileostomy","id":"ileostomy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/infection","id":"infection"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scan","id":"scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stoma","id":"stoma"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/contactable","id":"contactable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/conflicting%20information","id":"conflicting information"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/delays","id":"delays"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/access%20to%20specialist%20services","id":"access to specialist services"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%2019","id":"covid 19"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/889881","id":"889881"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/890769","id":"890769"}]},{"id":888185,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"feedback","body":"the staff are very nice and the doctors are helpful. maybe some books and toys in the waiting area would be good for kids if the pt has to wait to be seen","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2019-10-23T16:00:17","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-10-20T11:28:54","readBy":[{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2021)","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/888185","id":"888185"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/888185/responses","id":"888185"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/888185/healthservices","id":"888185"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/888185/tags","id":"888185"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/y02928","id":"Y02928","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good","id":"good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20good","id":"not good"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/888687","id":"888687"}]},{"id":887759,"author":"Safari dreamer","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"friendly and caring team","body":"The Endoscopy Team at North Devon Hospital demonstrate exactly why we should appreciate and value our NHS.

I was sad when she had to discharge me but I know if things are difficult again in the future I know how to make a re-referral.  \r\nThank you Annie!","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-10-19T12:22:44.29","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-10-20T11:55:25.36","readBy":[{"name":"Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust","count":6}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/887843","id":"887843"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/887843/responses","id":"887843"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/887843/healthservices","id":"887843"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/887843/tags","id":"887843"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rha-ld-city","id":"rha-ld-city","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/being%20listened%20to","id":"Being listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breathing","id":"breathing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helpful","id":"helpful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supportive","id":"supportive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/calm","id":"calm"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/888306","id":"888306"}]},{"id":887827,"author":"Whiskey22","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Mental health","body":"I feel that my Dr's and psychiatrist both think because I have been ill for so long that they now don't take into consideration my other health issues as they did before.

Knowing I have awful periods already, I knew going in that I would not be allowing myself to have this without adequate pain relief.  \r\nThe nurses were lovely and the consultant explained what would happen, however there was no mention of pain relief. It was at this time that I requested a General Anesthetic for the procedure and it was instantly agreed by the consultant, without question, which I am hugely thankful for.  \r\nRoll on a week and a half and I’m waiting to go into theatre. Again, the nurses were fantastic and do their best to put you at ease, however I was still very anxious. I was given a sedative prior to the main anaesthetic and it helped so much in making the whole thing better.  \r\nI woke up what seemed like two minutes later and this is where I feel the care went downhill, sadly.  \r\nI had told the anaesthetist prior to going in, that I suffer with horrendous sickness after anaesthetic and he assured me I would be given an anti-sickness medication to stop this.  \r\nUnfortunately, I was still very unwell after and couldn’t even keep water down for a couple of hours. Despite this, I was advised by a nurse that I needed to eat so that I could be discharged, as I’d already been there for ages.  \r\nI was also in awful pain from the procedure and asked for painkillers and I was brought Codeine. I explained that this usually makes me feel very nauseous and so I would prefer something else as I was already feeling very sick. I was told that I’d already had paracetamol, so couldn’t have anything else - surely Ibuprofen would have been readily available in a hospital setting? And so I was left to ride out the pain until it eased slightly.  \r\nUp until I woke up, the care was brilliant, but the aftercare was a let down. Despite this, I am very happy I was able to have a General, I know I absolutely would not have been able to do it as an Outpatient appointment and so please do push for this if this is what you want!","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-10-19T10:38:50.5633333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-10-20T12:59:00.267","readBy":[{"name":"Blackpool Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/887817","id":"887817"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/887817/responses","id":"887817"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/887817/healthservices","id":"887817"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/887817/tags","id":"887817"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rxl01_502","id":"RXL01_502","score":4},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/access%20to%20pain%20relief","id":"access to pain relief"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/aftercare","id":"aftercare"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anaesthetic","id":"Anaesthetic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/consultant","id":"consultant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hysteroscopy","id":"hysteroscopy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain%20relief","id":"pain relief"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/painkillers","id":"painkillers"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/periods","id":"periods"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pre%20op","id":"pre op"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/responsive","id":"responsive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sickness","id":"sickness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ultrasound","id":"ultrasound"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/relieved","id":"relieved"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20at%20ease","id":"put at ease"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/893298","id":"893298"}]},{"id":887880,"author":"pavoxg37","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Great service","body":"I was recently diagnosed with hemochromatosis and my treatment would involve venesection appointments every 2 weeks.  \r\nGiven typical experience of healthcare provision, I had low expectations of what the venesection service would be like.

No appointments available in any health centre in Livingston so I took her to the Vaccination centre Pyramids Business park today.  \r\nThanks to the Porter who provided us with a wheelchair when I asked as she was unable to stand for the 1 hour 20 mins she had to wait beyond her appointment time. The majority of others attending were similiarly vulnerable elderly and for example on crutches, with mobility aids or struggling with continued standing as there were no chairs in the long winding queue for at least the first hour.  \r\nThe gentleman next to us in the queue was immune compromised whilst nearby elderly lady very worried at leaving her relative who needs care at home on their own for such an unexpectedly long time. Meantime drop in’s - younger age group attending for first or second jabs- were being fast tracked through and although fit enough to be able to queue were going straight to the front, jabbed and out. We queued for over an hour before we heard that drop ins were to be stopped.  \r\nI fully appreciate the drive and need to get folks immunised for Covid including younger age groups and the challenges inherent to managing groups of people but vaccinations have been underway for months surely these and any demand peaks can be effectively managed and please consider the needs of the elderly and vulnerable in this process - given cohosting in progress.  \r\nIn addition consider providing updates as to ongoing time to wait which would be helpful especially for those who require medication at certain times and the wait is over an hour. Our experience today was of a poorly coordinated and managed process.  \r\nHowever, have to positively highlight the nurse in the booth, receptionist and porters for their courtesy and kindness. Nurse Libby especially deserves a mention- my mum was chilled from waiting and Libby was person centred in her approach.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-10-18T18:22:07.4566667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-10-20T13:22:23.277","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lothian","count":4}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/887590","id":"887590"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/887590/responses","id":"887590"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/887590/healthservices","id":"887590"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/887590/tags","id":"887590"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/ss9-covid19-vaccination-programme","id":"SS9-Covid19-Vaccination-Programme","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/chairs","id":"chairs"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/courtesy","id":"courtesy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/elderly","id":"elderly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kept%20informed","id":"kept informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kindness","id":"kindness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/porter","id":"porter"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vaccination","id":"vaccination"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vulnerable","id":"vulnerable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting%20area","id":"waiting area"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting%20time","id":"waiting time"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/well%20organised","id":"well organised"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/accurate%20timescales","id":"Accurate timescales"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/person%20centred%20care","id":"Person centred care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/prioritising","id":"prioritising"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/891531","id":"891531"}]},{"id":887874,"author":"listenfq38","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Courteous and thoughtful staff for Outpatient appointment","body":"Very clean, Polite staff  \r\nAll staff really courteous and thoughtful","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-10-19T13:44:00.6133333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-10-20T13:23:38.383","readBy":[{"name":"Stockport NHS Foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/887874","id":"887874"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/887874/responses","id":"887874"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/887874/healthservices","id":"887874"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/887874/tags","id":"887874"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rwj09-magnolia","id":"RWJ09-magnolia","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/courteous","id":"courteous"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/outpatients","id":"outpatients"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/polite%20staff","id":"polite staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thoughtful","id":"thoughtful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/clean","id":"clean"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/889815","id":"889815"}]},{"id":888213,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"S   L   O   W","body":"I asked for a blood test on 04/09 they gave me a video appointment on 06/09 .

The doctor stated he had to call the hospital to find out what medication to provide me with and that he would call me back. This putting me incomplete panic as I didn’t know what was going on.  \r\nThe doctor eventually called me back and said he could give me a prescription but I would be referred to the hospital as a matter of urgency. He then told me if I get any worse symptoms or anything to call them back immediately.  \r\nSince then on Sunday I have had constant bleeding and severe pain in my lower abdomen. I called my GP practice like I was advised to with any other issues, to be told they had no more appointments left I was to try again tomorrow. I called NHS24 for some advice to which they couldn’t help me either as my GP practice have a duty of care during the hours of 9-6. I have went on all day and all night with this severe pain and discomfort and no sleep for days, I have been feeling extremely down and depressed and this did not help the matter.  \r\nThis morning, I called the GP practice for another appointment. I waited on the phone for 40 minutes before someone eventually answered. I asked again for a doctor or a nurse appointment, to be told yet again they had no more appointments available try again tomorrow. I stated to the receptionist that I was advised by the doctor to call if any issue and I have phoned the past 2 days now. She advised there was nothing else she could do as they didn’t have appointments and were short staffed. The receptionist then advised to call NHS24 at 6pm when they close tonight. I understand that the NHS has a lot of strain and stress to deal with, but I’m a patient too. I might not have covid-19 symptoms but I am still not well with another condition. I totally understand they are short staffed but I still deserve the care and commitment from them.  \r\nI don’t ever phone the doctors surgery, if I have anything wrong with me I get on with it. I have done that for the past year and now I have an over active thyroid that hasn’t been treated. I have so many questions that haven’t been answered, I have pain and discomfort that is being dismissed.  \r\nI will try get through again tomorrow, but I have no hope.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-10-19T08:09:01.2966667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-10-20T14:07:21.27","readBy":[{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2021)","count":1},{"name":"NHS Lanarkshire","count":2},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":1},{"name":"Partnership for Change","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/887766","id":"887766"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/887766/responses","id":"887766"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/887766/healthservices","id":"887766"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/887766/tags","id":"887766"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sl9-gp","id":"sl9-gp","score":1},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anger","id":"anger"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/abdomen","id":"abdomen"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/access%20to%20appointments","id":"access to appointments"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/answering%20questions","id":"answering questions"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bleeding","id":"bleeding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/depressed","id":"depressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dismissed","id":"dismissed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hurt","id":"hurt"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/manners","id":"manners"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staffing","id":"Staffing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thyroid","id":"thyroid"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unsettled","id":"unsettled"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/888222","id":"888222"}]},{"id":888227,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Hard to contact","body":"I have recently tried to get an appointment two days running.

I was not even put in a queuing system. When I did eventually get through I had missed any appointments for that day with the GP. On the second day I was offered a telephone consultation with the Pharmacist. I possibly have symptoms of a chest infection but it could also be Asthma, however I was  prescribed antibiotics without anyone listening to my chest. I cannot see a GP or go to the surgery as I have been told I have symptoms of COVID (a cough, however this is chronic and not new and furthermore I have had several negative lateral flow tests and been double jabbed and recently had a booster too). What is going on? It is nigh on impossible to see a GP. I understand the pressure the NHS is under, I am a health care practitioner leading a team who have been in the thick of it with COVID patients too.
