We were then prepped for theater for 9am and briefed by our lead surgeon and the anesthetist.  \r\nThere were many NHS team members in theatre. Due to the moment, I didn’t keep track of all of their names but they all were amazing!!! Very friendly, helpful and professional.  \r\nMy partner mentioned the spinal tap was done perfectly as she hardly felt pain, the effects took place almost instantly. Throughout the surgery, the anaesthetist was very friendly, attentive and most of all kept us informed as to what was going on and what to expect whilst administering medication though out the procedure. Looked after us like a hawk and was on top of any situation when it happened. Allowed my partner to be conscious and part of seeing our son’s birth which had not been possible for her during our daughter’s birth.  \r\nThe staff member from SCBU was so friendly and it was lovely to have small talk while we waited for our son's arrival. I then knew he was in good hands as he needed some extra care (I was given the terminology but I confess I could not comprehend it), then explained that he needed to go to the SCBU unit and I was given the choice to either stay with with my partner or join them. She requested that I stayed with her.  \r\nThere was a brief moment (which was later explained in detail) where there was a tense moment during the operation. I felt the tension in the room, however this is where the professionalism of the surgical team started to shine, at no moment did I panic as I knew that the situation was under control.  \r\nI have a very inquisitive mind and wanted to see the details of the operation which I’m sure is a little uncommon however I was allowed to observe the procedure from the surgery side of the “curtain” and so I was given clear instructions as to where I could stand and what I was not allowed to touch. My general rule was “don’t touch anything” and I was fine. I was given permission to take pictures and videos throughout the procedure, at one point I was looking at my son leaving the uterus and not through the phone which prompted a staff member to ask me if they could continue taking the video while I continued to focused on the moment which I will be forever grateful for.  \r\nWe then returned to the Labor Ward  \r\nSadly, shortly after being congratulated by a senior nurse, we were confronted about suspected Data Protection infringement.  \r\nThey went on to explain the following:  \r\n• We were not given permission to take pictures/video in theater without consent of everyone involved. This is strange as this was strongly encouraged by the team in as well as a letter sent by the NHS beforehand. Members of staff even assisted in taking the videos.  \r\n• Insisted that I remove all videos/images in full view. Knowing the law myself, in order to settle the situation, I unwillingly showed all our photos and videos to prove that they consisted of my wife’s body and NHS hands which should infringe no laws as no faces were shown.  \r\n• Mentioned that it was members of the surgical team who made the complaints. This is not the case as we personally spoke to the surgeon who had no issue with it.  \r\n• Claimed that they have never heard of anyone taking videos/images in theater. This is strange to us as during a previous birth at this hospital, and this time, it was under general anesthetic, I was not allowed to be in theater, the team was all to happy to take a video of the procedure on our behalf, a positive gesture we applaud.  \r\n• Then mentioned that there is an administrative process that we needed to follow beforehand. If this is the case, to avoid unnecessary confrontations, I suggest informing all future parents of this procedure. Regardless, this was an emergency C-Section, not sure how we would have completed the administrative process even if we knew the process.  \r\nWe felt belittled in front of two other team members (this was not even done in a private environment). This is such a pity as this ruined our moment especially after the trauma my partner had just gone through and she still hadn’t met the little one she had just delivered.  \r\nBack to Positives:  \r\nThe doctor did two debriefings, I personally would love to invite for tea one day, post Covid-19, as they are such a lovely individual to be with and we couldn’t have been luckier to have this doctor bring our child into this world.  \r\nAll team members were AMAZING throughout our stay!To sum up, I honestly thought we would never have a better experience at BGH then our first child’s birth, I now stand corrected, not only were we blown away by the professionalism of each individual, we were BOTH treated like guests in a five star hotel.","criticality":"mildly

patient","title":"Some of the team","body":"Depending on who you speak to the Crisis Team has been either very supportive, or at worst, hostile, rude, impatient and making us feel we don’t deserve their precious time. Given that the people ringing them will be feeling distressed, possibly suicide, in a lot of emotional pain, the team has not shown us a lot of understanding that we may be finding it difficult to find the words we need.  \r\nThe first seemed to have no concept of how difficult it is to go through a trauma and how much courage I needed to ring up because I was nervous as to what to say and how to say it. Some of the team at Mansfield have been just what I needed. They’ve spoken to me respectfully and gently, with kindness and great understanding. Why can’t all the Crisis team members be as helpful as them? A patient shouldn’t self harm or experience even lower self esteem as a result of speaking to someone who is meant to help them but has made them feel like dirt. Thank you to those of you who are caring and compassionate. I hope the others of you come to realise.  \r\nI called Nottingham City crisis team and I told my trauma to the person and all the person told me was that I need primary help (Therapy, counselling) which I have already done, and said I need to google how to cope and how to reduce my anxiety and take medication to control my anxiety and distract myself. These are the worst advice I have ever had and they made me feel way worse and made me feel like my problem it's not worthy of the time.  \r\nI was told to go on a walk, ride a bicycle, go swimming to distract myself, however I have tried every single thing they have recommended and yet they still told me to be patient. I am feeling way worse after the call and I feel like I've just wasted my time and their time and they have belittled my trauma. Now I feel way more likely to self harm to reduce my pain because no one else around me wants to help me and been turned down by the crisis team.","criticality":"moderately

It has worked well alongside other perinatal mental health care I have received. They were able to run zoom courses such as mellow bumps which was amazing as it again provided support but also helped provide a sense of connection and reduced the isolation associated with pregnancy during the coronavirus pandemic. It provided a place to discuss concerns, feelings and ideas with other mums and form peer support.  \r\nEven having previous children being able to bounce of the ideas and concerns of others in a safe place was amazing and helped alot to alleviate anxieties and stress.

If you are sent to this Perthshire clinic please be reassured that they will put your needs first and that you could not be in safer hands.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-04-23T10:18:37.33","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-04-26T12:08:00.063","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Tayside","count":13}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/841178","id":"841178"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/841178/responses","id":"841178"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/841178/healthservices","id":"841178"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/841178/tags","id":"841178"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/t202h_502","id":"T202H_502","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxious","id":"anxious"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/encouraging","id":"encouraging"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gas%20and%20air","id":"gas and air"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hysteroscopy","id":"hysteroscopy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kind","id":"kind"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nursing%20care","id":"nursing care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/positive","id":"positive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professionalism","id":"professionalism"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sympathetic","id":"sympathetic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/welcoming","id":"welcoming"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20for","id":"cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confidence","id":"confidence"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassuring","id":"reassuring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20ease","id":"at ease"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20worried","id":"not worried"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/843264","id":"843264"}]},{"id":841198,"author":"cafeyk93","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Put me at ease","body":"I attended for removal of a lesion from my ear.

When booked in, I was told to get changed into a gown but the gown I was given only had 1 tie on...I didn't ask for another one because luckily I took my own dressing gown. However had I have not had my own dressing gown I would have felt extremely embarrassed.  \r\nAfter the procedure, I was taken back to a cubicle where I expressed the need to go to the toilet. I asked 3 different nurses, on 3 seperate occasions to fetch me a bottle but each time my request was unfulfilled. I was extremely desperate and sadly due to not being given a bottle, I had an accident and urinated over myself and the bed, which was extremely embarrassing.  \r\nDespite being a gentleman of 82, I am still very independent and always manage to make it to the toilet at home and wait if out and about. I wouldn't have needed any help to use the bottle so it would have taken no time at all to fetch one for me, especially as I was unable to get up out of bed after my procedure.  \r\nI am extremely disappointed with the lack of care, attention and respect for my dignity on this occasion. I feel that having to ask twice was bad enough, but three times is absolutely unacceptable and what happened as a result should never have been allowed to happen.  \r\nFurther to this, I felt that my discharge took a long amount of time and this made an already poor experience more difficult. One part of my medication I was due to take home was also missing.  \r\nOverall, despite the procedure going well, for which I am very grateful, it has been overshadowed by the poor care I received.  \r\nPlease ensure that this doesn't happen again so others people don't need to suffer the same indignity I had to endure.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-04-23T13:47:32.2066667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-04-26T13:25:06.293","readBy":[{"name":"BPP University, BSc Nursing (Adult) 2019-03","count":1},{"name":"Torbay and South Devon NHS Foundation Trust","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/841229","id":"841229"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/841229/responses","id":"841229"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/841229/healthservices","id":"841229"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/841229/tags","id":"841229"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/ra901_101","id":"RA901_101","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disappointed","id":"disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/embarrassed","id":"embarrassed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/embarrassment","id":"embarrassment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lack%20of%20care","id":"Lack of care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/accident","id":"accident"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/aftercare","id":"aftercare"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/day%20surgery","id":"day surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/desperate","id":"desperate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/help","id":"help"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hospital%20discharge","id":"hospital discharge"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/procedure","id":"procedure"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/respect","id":"respect"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/toilet","id":"toilet"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/urology","id":"urology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dignity","id":"Dignity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20disappointed","id":"very disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication%20error","id":"medication error"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/847574","id":"847574"}]},{"id":841213,"author":"pagerrj54","authorRoleId":3,"authorRole":"a parent/guardian","title":"Excellent experience","body":"We are writing about our video appointment this week which was efficient and although apprehensive initially it was much less stressful than attending in person. &nbsp;

My child has night time incontinence and uses incontinence pads to protect their mattress at night time. I enquired as to whether we could be provided with these from the NHS as they have a medical need for them and they are rather expensive. The nurse advised me that these could not be provided due to my child having no issues with daytime continence and that if they were incontinent and soiling during the day, products could be provided by the health board for both daytime and night time incontinence but that if the patient only has night time incontinence products cannot be made available.  \r\nI am struggling to understand the rationale for this and therefore, I would like someone from the health board to come back to me to help me understand.  \r\nIn addition to this, the nurse advised me that the paediatric incontinence service is no longer operating from clinics in the Camglen (Rutherglen and Cambuslang) area. This is very inconvenient for families living in the area, particularly those who, like myself, do not have a car. My child has autism and therefore, the enuresis clinic is not the only medical appointment that they are required to miss school (and I work) to attend. Travelling on public transport to a clinic in Blantyre or East Kilbride, means that we will miss an entire session of school and a morning or afternoon of work as opposed to an hour if the clinic was closer to home. I would ask that the decision to remove clinics from Camglen be reconsidered.  \r\nKind regards","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-04-23T14:03:00.2666667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-04-26T13:29:11.06","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lanarkshire","count":10},{"name":"North Lanarkshire Health & Social Care Partnership","count":3}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/841233","id":"841233"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/841233/responses","id":"841233"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/841233/healthservices","id":"841233"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/841233/tags","id":"841233"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sl9-community-services-child-nursing","id":"SL9-community-services-child-nursing","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/continence","id":"continence"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/enuresis","id":"enuresis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/incontinence","id":"incontinence"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/incontinent","id":"incontinent"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/paediatric","id":"paediatric"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/service%20relocation","id":"service relocation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/access%20to%20continence%20supplies","id":"access to continence supplies"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/841481","id":"841481"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/843304","id":"843304"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/843464","id":"843464"}]},{"id":841254,"author":"zebrazg69","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Everyone was so kind to mum","body":"&nbsp;A word of thanks to the A&amp;E staff in SWAH especially to Janine, Alanah and helper Caroline.

It was agreed that she could but it would have to be administered in the hospital in case she took a negative reaction to it.  \r\nI am her only brother and because of previous strokes need to use a rollator, so I was accompanying her on the day.  \r\nOn the day, perhaps because of my visible disability and my sister's white cane, we were fast-tracked through the triage process despite the fact that there were around 40 people in the queue ahead of us.  \r\nAfter a brief wait we went in to the nurse, Julie, who after listening to the list of my sister's issues and especially because of the allergy aspect went and brought in a doctor to talk with her.  \r\nThis doctor (Dr Drew) was very easy to talk with, most reassuring, and set out the pros and cons of the situation for my sister. She also suggested that after getting the vaccine it would be advantageous to sit for 30 minutes instead of the usual 15.  \r\nAfter getting her vaccine, Julie very kindly aided my sister along the corridor to a chair and gave instructions to others to keep an eye out for her. We have nothing but praise for both Dr Drew and Julie Chambers for their professionalism and genuine care.  \r\nWe also want to thank trainee nurse Asha and nurse Lee who were very diligent in making sure that my sister was OK and getting her a drink of water as she was very warm - the hospital was hot that day. Lee especially checked with us and kept us right on the time we were sitting.  \r\nAfter the final paperwork was dealt with at the counter she took us outside by a shorter route. Our thanks to her and the other nurse.  \r\nMy sister's next appointment for the 2nd vaccination at the end of May will be at the SSE arena in Belfast, which if I am being honest will be more difficult for us to get to, as neither of us find public transport the easiest to use.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-04-23T22:39:15.44","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-04-26T15:15:59.107","readBy":[{"name":"South Eastern Health and Social Care Trust","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/841269","id":"841269"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/841269/responses","id":"841269"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/841269/healthservices","id":"841269"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/841269/tags","id":"841269"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt004-cvc","id":"ZT004-cvc","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/easy%20to%20talk%20to","id":"easy to talk to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/personal%20service","id":"personal service"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vaccination","id":"vaccination"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20for","id":"cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassuring","id":"reassuring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thanks","id":"thanks"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%20vaccine","id":"covid vaccine"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/841502","id":"841502"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/841603","id":"841603"}]},{"id":841493,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"A wonderful service and dedicated team?","body":"I attended the practice this morning for minor surgery, and as always found the team both professional and caring.

I was then introduced to Jen and Miss Kangeyan who went through the procedure and the results process in a way that was clear and easy for me to understand.  \r\nWhen the procedure was taking place I felt extremely comfortable and looked after, even in the more painful moments.  \r\nEach step of the way, I felt well informed about what was going on and my worst fears about any further treatment have been relieved! I can't thank the nurses and consultants enough!","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-04-23T13:47:16.29","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-04-26T16:01:12.08","readBy":[{"name":"United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust","count":4},{"name":"Ulster University, MBBS (Medicine) 2021","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/841228","id":"841228"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/841228/responses","id":"841228"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/841228/healthservices","id":"841228"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/841228/tags","id":"841228"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rwdda_502","id":"RWDDA_502","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nervous","id":"nervous"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cervical%20smear","id":"cervical smear"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/colposcopy","id":"colposcopy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/encouraging","id":"encouraging"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/information","id":"information"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kept%20informed","id":"kept informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lovely","id":"lovely"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20introduction","id":"staff introduction"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supportive","id":"supportive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/test","id":"test"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/understanding","id":"understanding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fantastic","id":"fantastic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/relieved","id":"relieved"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/energy","id":"Energy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/explanations","id":"explanations"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20ease","id":"at ease"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/849734","id":"849734"}]},{"id":841258,"author":"lionsm98","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"referral from gp","body":"I was referred by my gp after two years of a problem with the skin on my fingers that I cannot resolve. , &nbsp;

The support I received during my pregnancy was amazing, from the extra reassurance scans, to the weekend visits to triage unit for reassurance CTGs, any questions I had every staff member took the time to explain fully the answers to me and my husband.  \r\nThe staff were fantastic, and they all took the time to know my history. I never felt like I was a bother, and nothing was every to much. It was fantastic to have had such person centred care, which included the effect that my previous obstetrics history would have on my mental health during my pregnancy. Especially when lock down came around and my husband was no longer able to support me at scans, we understood fully why I had to go alone but there was always time to get my husband on the phone so he could hear everything that was being said.  \r\nMy son was born happy and healthy in September 2020, via a planned controlled c section after being breach, preformed Dr Crichton, along with the same midwife who had delivered my son in 2018, Senior Charge Midwife Racheal. The theatre staff again all took the time to reassure me and answer all my questions.  \r\nMy care after my son was born was also second to none, Midwife Sophie in Ashgrove had started my induction with my son Findley in 2018, and it was amazing to have her care for me and Lewis during my stay after my section, we had a stay of 7 days after my son was born, it was hard being away from my friends and family, but again my mental health was well looked after, and i felt supported.  \r\nOur journey was not an easy one, but we will forever be thankful to the teams who cared for us, and showed us amazing support.  \r\nUnfortunately I had complications post section which results in two further stays in AMH, again the care was amazing from the obstetrics teams. I have worked in healthcare care for over 15 years and I have never met such amazing supportive staff, especially senior Medical staff.  \r\nA special mention to Dr Crichton, SCM Shewan and Midwife Sophie, in addition to all the teams in Triage Unit, ANC, Ashgrove Ward and Summerfield.

However, my overall experience was actually really positive.  \r\nI’m not going to lie, not being able to have your partner stay overnight to help fully support is pretty tough - especially as nights with a newborn are long and you sometimes need that reassurance when you’re not sure what you’re doing! At the moment though, visiting times to the post-natal ward are 9-5pm. I really do hope this changes soon and birth partners are allowed to stay during the night. That said, all the midwives I had supporting me were lovely. And after having a planned c section, where I wasn’t able to get out of my bed, they were always quick to respond to my call button. Special thanks to my midwife Kemi, and the rest of the team, including the lovely student midwives I met. My planned c section was also a lot calmer than I was expecting and the entire team in theatre were fantastic and really made me feel at ease.  \r\nThis was my second time giving birth. My first experience was elsewhere and I can honestly say my overall experience at Newham was better. My antenatal care was predominantly with a named midwife at the Barking Birth Centre which was fantastic and I had a great midwife (Beth).  \r\nTowards the end of my pregnancy, I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes and this is where the care maybe lacked a little, particularly with regards to one consultant who left me in tears. However that is the only negative I can say about my entire experience at Newham Hospital.  \r\nSo for anyone else about to give birth at Newham, please don’t worry yourself too much with all the negative birth stories from Newham. Everyone’s experience is different and I hope yours will be just as positive as mine.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-04-24T06:33:34.5933333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-04-26T16:23:14.937","readBy":[{"name":"Barts Health NHS Trust","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/841337","id":"841337"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/841337/responses","id":"841337"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/841337/healthservices","id":"841337"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/841337/tags","id":"841337"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/r1hnh_501","id":"R1HNH_501","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/antenatal","id":"antenatal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/birth","id":"birth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/c%20section","id":"c section"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/consultant","id":"consultant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/food%20choice","id":"food choice"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gestational%20diabetes","id":"gestational diabetes"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/giving%20birth","id":"giving birth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/midwives","id":"midwives"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/positive","id":"positive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pregnancy","id":"pregnancy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/response%20to%20buzzer","id":"response to buzzer"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20ease","id":"at ease"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thanks","id":"thanks"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/841663","id":"841663"}]},{"id":841338,"author":"Ben093","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Stroke","body":"I had an intracerebral haemorrhagic stroke with Ventricular extensions.

I’ve never felt more grateful and proud of you ward 4 PRI. Inspired, thankful, and overwhelmed by kindness.I wish to extend my sincere gratitude to the amazing team of colleagues who looked after me during my week long admission as a patient (April 2021.) As a consultant receiving care, it has reinforced how immensely proud I am of the acute medical receiving ward at PRI and how well you look after patients, now reflected by my own first hand experience. More than 42 individuals were involved in looking after me from door to door and although I cannot mention everyone by name, you all know who you are and how you’ve helped. I am forever grateful. The care and attention of the nurses in such a busy department was exceptional (special mention goes to Pauline, Jean, Mingle, Gemma, Tia, Robyn, Sophie(bank nurse) Emma, and Laura.) To the health care support workers (Edna and Teresa) and domestics (Audrey, Kerry, Kathy), thank you for ensuring my comfort. To my fantastic medical colleagues for the wit, humour and generosity alongside top notch clinical acumen. Thank you to my consultant Dr Harper and for the kindnesses of all my consultant colleagues who took the time to check in on me from point of admission through investigation to departure -this meant more to me than you can imagine and I’m so very thankful for your time (Dr Williamson, Dr Al-Khairalla, Dr Clark, Dr Sloan, Dr Cadden, Dr Jordan, Dr Habicht, and Dr Currie.)To all the porters especially Dennis( thanks for the lemon drizzle chat) and Alec for cheerfulness as you go about your day, thanks for all that you do. To Cairstiona physiotherapist( I hope this spelling is correct!) thanks for getting me back on my feet. To Carol and David our administrative team thank you. Finally to the radiology and laboratory services, your contribution hastened diagnosis. Thank you. Special thanks to our junior medical staff: Dill, Verity, Ali Baird, Barry and Matthew, who took time to have banter alongside day to day medical tasks. It made what could have been a potentially isolating time, a time of comfort. I am forever thankful and proud to see you all blossoming.  \r\nWith immense gratitude.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-04-24T15:22:28.3533333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-04-26T17:11:12.95","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Tayside","count":19}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/841364","id":"841364"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/841364/responses","id":"841364"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/841364/healthservices","id":"841364"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/841364/tags","id":"841364"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/t202h-acute-receiving","id":"t202h-acute-receiving","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/attention%20to%20detail","id":"attention to detail"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dietary%20requirements","id":"dietary requirements"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctors","id":"doctors"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gluten%20free%20food","id":"gluten free food"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/humour","id":"humour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/inspired","id":"inspired"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kindness","id":"kindness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medical%20team","id":"Medical Team"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nursing%20care","id":"nursing care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/physiotherapist","id":"physiotherapist"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/porters","id":"porters"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attitude","id":"staff attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20handover","id":"staff handover"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/team","id":"team"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thankful","id":"Thankful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/provision%20of%20vegan%20meals","id":"Provision of vegan meals"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/banter","id":"banter"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/841697","id":"841697"}]},{"id":841365,"author":"hippoyg37","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Outpatient Appointment","body":"I attend the air lab in Daisy Hill Hospital SHSCT this morning for lung function tests.
