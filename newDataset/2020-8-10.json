A video assessment took place with a Dr in the Dermatology Department following two video assessments with a Dr at EC Medical Centre. The outcome was that I would receive a letter confirming an appointment to attend the Deramatology Department for treatment.  \r\nOver three weeks ago I contacted reception at the Dermatology Department and was informed that my details were on the Dr's desk and the receptionist offered to call me back with details of an appointment.  \r\nThe receptionist intimated that she thought my condition was not a priority. I have received no further information and don't know whether the outcome of my assessment was deemed a non priority and therefore shelved.  \r\nThis morning I tried again to contact Dermatolgy Department to ask:  \r\n1: Why no one has got back to me after waiting 3 weeks for a response.  \r\n2. Confirmation that my treatment been shelved.  \r\n3. Why an appointment letter has not been issued and received.  \r\n4. An explanation for why my telephone call was on hold this morning for over 57 minutes before the call dialling tone switched to music then went silent.  \r\n5. Why last Friday I received a text from UCH thanking me for attending an appointment. Which I had no notice of and didn't attend.  \r\nI fully appreciate these are exceptional times. However I am disappointed by this shoddy service particularly after paying contributions through my salary to the NHS during my long career as a teacher. I am now 61 years old and have rarely needed treatment from the NHS I recognise I am very lucky. It is disappointing to learn that when I needed help from the NHS it has not been available to me.  \r\nI am shocked and appalled by what appears to me to be a complete shambles of a service!  \r\nPlease advise.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-08-03T10:00:51.2333333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-08-10T09:20:01.45","readBy":[{"name":"Croydon Health Services NHS Trust","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/778996","id":"778996"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/778996/responses","id":"778996"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/778996/healthservices","id":"778996"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/778996/tags","id":"778996"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/h83044","id":"H83044","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rj611_330","id":"RJ611_330","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appalled","id":"appalled"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disappointed","id":"disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/shocked","id":"shocked"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appointment%20letter","id":"appointment letter"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dermatology","id":"dermatology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wait%20time","id":"wait time"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/service","id":"service"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/780104","id":"780104"}]},{"id":779699,"author":"P14466078","authorRoleId":4,"authorRole":"a relative","title":"Dementia Care","body":"My mother was recently in Ward 52 then transferred to an assessment unit. 3 days before she moved I took in a full bag of clothes including brand new underwear and trousers.

It was only later on a second call it was confirmed that the referral had just been made in May 2020 and only because I had questioned the 5 month delay during the first call. So if I hadn’t queried it would have been lost in the system and I am now facing a longer wait through no fault of my own and ultimately through patient neglect. I had previous life saving spinal surgery in August 2015 which has left me with reduced function in my right leg so I do depend on my left leg. I had mentioned during the consultation in December that I felt I was losing strength in my left leg now and was concerned as it was my strong leg as such. This has deteriorated further since December with the leg feeling weaker, compromised and constant pain flowing through my spine, into my left bum cheek and down the leg.  \r\nI feel let down by the system. I feel lied to and ultimately I feel scared that if there is an issue I am 8 months down the line, getting worse and no sign of an appointment for screening.  \r\nIf it turns out that my leg is damaged and it could have been prevented through earlier action, I will not hesitate to take this matter further.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-08-07T22:14:18.44","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-08-10T10:48:57.553","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":7},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2020)","count":1},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":1},{"name":"South Lanarkshire Health and Social Care Forum","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/779855","id":"779855"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/779855/responses","id":"779855"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/779855/healthservices","id":"779855"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/779855/tags","id":"779855"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sj9qe-400","id":"sj9qe-400","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sj9qe-810","id":"sj9qe-810","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxious","id":"anxious"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/apprehensive","id":"apprehensive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scared","id":"scared"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/honesty","id":"honesty"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/leg","id":"leg"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mri","id":"mri"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mri%20scan","id":"MRI scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/neglect","id":"neglect"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/referral","id":"referral"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scan","id":"scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/spinal","id":"spinal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/spinal%20surgery","id":"spinal surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/spine","id":"spine"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20concerned","id":"very concerned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/weakness","id":"weakness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/no%20scan","id":"no scan"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/780323","id":"780323"}]},{"id":780002,"author":"People Power","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Wonderful A&E staff","body":"I'd like to express my thanks to the 2 men who called an ambulance and to the paramedics Kirsteen and Gale who came to my assistance on Saturday afternoon, when I'd a bigger seizure in \"The Hidden Garden\", ironically within Gartnavel Royal Hospital grounds, Glasgow.  \r\nAlso thanks to the wonderful A & E staff of the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital, who work tirelessly in these difficult times.

I can’t fault our experience. Padua ward was clean and very comfortable. I was able to sleep next to his bed and the ward staff made sure I was well looked after and fed as well as looking after my son. All the staff were friendly and helpful. As for the surgical team, well, wow! Such amazing people. They explained everything so well, reassured my son and I, were funny and friendly. They allowed me in to the theatre to be with him until he was asleep. The nursing staff monitored him closely after his surgery and our discharge the following day was smooth and speedy. We were in and out of the hospital in less than 24 hours. I can’t thank everyone enough, including the cleaners that came in to clean and the lady that took our food orders. Not at any point were we concerned about Covid 19. The hospital was taking all precautions which reassured us that our visit was safe. Our family are very grateful for the care and kindness my son and I received.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-08-09T18:47:33","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-08-10T11:46:06","readBy":[{"name":"East Kent Hospitals University NHS Foundation Trust","count":2}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/780065","id":"780065"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/780065/responses","id":"780065"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/780065/healthservices","id":"780065"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/780065/tags","id":"780065"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rvv01","id":"RVV01","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appendicectomy","id":"appendicectomy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/concerned","id":"concerned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency","id":"emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fed%20up","id":"fed up"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/safe","id":"safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20concerned","id":"very concerned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/well%20looked%20after","id":"well looked after"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing","id":"amazing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/781714","id":"781714"}]},{"id":780067,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Great service","body":"Just been treated for a bump on my head.

I had driven myself to hospital so it couldn’t be that sore and 4.

My partner had to leave me at the door to the ward not knowing what was going to happen to me or our baby which was extremely upsetting for both my partner and myself as a first time mother and makes a scary situation even more frightening.

Long waiting times. Poor…","body":"Vine House medical center has been my doctors for years now, but only because it is local. The service is generally unfriendly. The booking processes available makes it hard to book appointments. The 'Online Consult' option only gets answered randomly. The last time I tried to use it the receptionist said on the phone when I have had no option but to call the practice to try to book to see or talk to a doctor. \"They have seen it, but haven't actioned anything.\" Being left in the dark, waiting for a response that isn't going to come doesn't help the patient who may be going through all manner of sickness and pain etc... \nThe waiting times for appointments is ridiculously long. Appointment availability is very poor. The modern building always appears woefully underutilized, which is not helping the appointment waiting times. So many rooms there which I have never seen used. I have never seen more than four people in the waiting room that is easily big enough for twenty five plus. If you are unwell or have a pain, you need to see a doctor. You may not consider yourself 'an emergency', but you would still like to be seen as quickly as possible. Unfortunately, as I have heard other people say who use this facility, the only way you can get to see a doctor within three weeks, is to try and book 'an emergency/urgent' appointment. Or try and phone in at 08:00 to try and get one of the couple of appointment slots available which is impossible, as everyone else is having to do the same, and usually you can't even get through because the lines are in use. If you are ill, unwell or in pain, you need to see a doctor within a day or two at the most, not have to wait two weeks or more after trying to eventually get a pre-booked routine appointment slot.  I really would not like to have had to write a review like this, but I am forever disappointed at how hard it is to simply see or even speak to a doctor and often simply get through to the practice. This practice has the ability to be so much more. However, I always end up feeling disappointed at the poor service on the occasions when I have needed them most.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-08-10T10:10:01","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2020-08-10T15:00:36","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/780110","id":"780110"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/780110/responses","id":"780110"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/780110/healthservices","id":"780110"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/780110/tags","id":"780110"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/e82046","id":"E82046","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disappointed","id":"disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency","id":"emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sickness","id":"sickness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20disappointed","id":"very disappointed"}]},{"id":780109,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Appalling way to treat patients ","body":"On the rare occasions I have managed to get through on the phones, staff constantly give mixed messages left right and centre.

She was advised that she could attend the Drive-Through Phlebotomy service based at Sheffield Arena, instead of going to the local GP surgery or the Phlebotomy service at the Hallamshire Hospital were she would normally go (we were unsure if this was running or not anyway).  \r\nSo fast forward a few weeks, my mum decided to the Drive-Through Phlebotomy service and as she didn't drive, I (daughter) took her. She was understandably anxious about it and we decided to wear masks to give both us and the staff running the service an extra line of defence (we are in a pandemic, after all). Once we arrived if was clearly sign posted and the staff member who was directing cars in, was really friendly and helpful. We drove around to the service, which was all spaced out at 2 meters and the staff were in PPE.  \r\nThe Phlebotomist was really friendly, chatty and helped put my mum at ease. The Phlebotomist explained how things were done and why, she appreciated that we wore masks and she also understood that having your blood taken whilst putting your arm out of the car window is tricky. She helped my mum get comfortable in order to start taking blood. However after 2 attempts the Phlebotomist had no luck, and said she didn't want to keep trying any cause any unnecessary discomfort or pain, so asked for assistance from a senior member of staff. The senior Phlebotomist was also very friendly, chatty and explained everything. She managed to get the blood sample from my mum, and we were all able to have a joke about how strange it is to go for a Phlebotomist appointment in the car. All staff were friendly, patient and professional, The Drive-Through Phlebotomy Service was set-up very well and clearly followed all health and safety guidelines.

We did this and got treated the same way we did from the previous phone call saying they will get the doc to call, the rash had grown and got worse all over his body by now and i couldn't wait any longer for treatment so i took him to a drop in center to be seen to where i drove to the other side of Leeds for them to see him i got there and he was seen by a doctor who diagnosed him within minutes saying he needed cream and shampoo, the doctor also said that our doctors should of seen him as he is a child with a massive rash all over his body and they can not diagnose this stuff over a phone, Anyway i was happy now because he was getting the treatment he needed, the only thing is we didn't get prescribed enough cream to last a week so i got in touch with pharmacy they told me to ring docs, i phoned docs they told me to ring pharmacy, am getting confussed now because no one at gables surgery or pharmacy seem to know what to do because of the conflicting answers, we finally came up with an answer where i had to request more cream from there online portal, i did this phoned them back the receptionist said she had sent it through so i thought great i will get a phone call later to go pick it up from pharmacy. I didn't get one in fact i phoned them back 3 hours from requesting it and i got told the doctor needs to speak to us so he will ring us in the morning, my fear is now that it will come back over night and we will be back to square one, seems like a whole lot of trouble this to fix a Childs health don't you think. This practice seems to be sweeping things under the carpet and blaming coronavirus for the inconvenience but it wasn't an inconvenience for a walk in center to look at him at the other side of Leeds. Very poor care in this instance. I also don't understand why the doctor needs to phone us back when you can buy this certain cream over the counter, i wouldn't be asking for it if he didn't need it, i can see my child a whole lot better than a doctor can over the phone.

I know COVID 19 isn’t helping but surely I should be getting support from NHS.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-08-07T13:24:50.82","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-08-11T09:52:01.307","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Dumfries and Galloway","count":19},{"name":"St. Andrews University ScotGEM Medical Students","count":1},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2021)","count":1},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":1},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2020)","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/779819","id":"779819"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/779819/responses","id":"779819"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/779819/healthservices","id":"779819"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/779819/tags","id":"779819"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sy9-gp","id":"sy9-gp","score":3},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/y144h_300","id":"Y144H_300","score":5},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/y144h-speech","id":"y144h-speech","score":3},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/abandoned","id":"abandoned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anger","id":"anger"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frustrated","id":"frustrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20being%20listened%20to","id":"not being listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20pressure","id":"blood pressure"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fibromyalgia","id":"fibromyalgia"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/follow%20up%20care","id":"Follow up care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/high%20blood%20pressure","id":"high blood pressure"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hospital%20care","id":"hospital care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/legs","id":"legs"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/physio","id":"physio"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/speech","id":"speech"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attitude","id":"staff attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stroke","id":"stroke"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ward%20staff","id":"ward staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing","id":"amazing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/no%20confidence","id":"no confidence"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/780261","id":"780261"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/780300","id":"780300"}]},{"id":779826,"author":"Letdownjuly20","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Only the doctor seemed to care","body":"Sadly I had to attend Eden for blood tests due to a possible miscarriage. I had an appointment and buzzed the door to attend, when I was let through a support worker came up to me, didn’t ask my name or make any introductions and just shoved a tympanic thermometer in my ear and then shouted back to the front desk my temperature. It took me by surprise to say the least!  \r\nThen barked at me to go and wash my hands, I was apologetic that I hadn’t seen the sink and the signs behind all the boxes in the corridor. None of the staff spoke to me or asked if I was ok. I then waited in the waiting room which isn’t exactly calming or reassuring for women who are attending only for miscarriages, terminations and other horrible gynae related issues. You would think that given the sadness of the ward that the staff would at least try to be kind and empathetic. The doctor called me through to the treatment room and took my blood, and was lovely, actually the only member of staff who spoke to me like a person and not treated me like a task.  \r\nThe treatment room had blood all up the examination lamp with a big handprint on the top and there was blood on the drip stand. I felt like I was sitting in the scene of something pretty horrid. Once my bloods were done the doctor showed me out.  \r\nI’m a nurse, and I work in the hospital and I would never treat a patient the way I was treated, they should be ashamed of themselves. They knew why I was attending and I had managed to keep it together for my appointment but inside my heart was breaking and only the doctor seemed to care. Terrible terrible care, I hope I never have to go there again.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-08-07T14:22:03.05","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-08-11T10:06:00.92","readBy":[{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2020)","count":2},{"name":"Royal Cornwall Hospitals NHS Trust","count":12}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/779826","id":"779826"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/779826/responses","id":"779826"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/779826/healthservices","id":"779826"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/779826/tags","id":"779826"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/ref12_502","id":"REF12_502","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20cared%20for","id":"not cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sadness","id":"sadness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/basic%20care","id":"basic care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood","id":"blood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20tests","id":"blood tests"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cleanliness","id":"cleanliness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctor","id":"doctor"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gynae","id":"gynae"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/introductions","id":"introductions"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kindness","id":"kindness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/miscarriage","id":"miscarriage"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attitude","id":"staff attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/terrible","id":"terrible"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/781092","id":"781092"}]},{"id":779830,"author":"Disappointed of Nottingham","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Attitude of staff at local CMHT","body":"Before I go into the story I want to acknowledge that we are all living in difficult times and it affects us all individually in different ways.  \r\nI have to attend my local Community Mental Health Team base every fourth week for a Depot injection. Since lock down we have to book an appointment as Clinics as I understand it have been suspended. The last few times when I have rang I have been unfortunate enough to be answered by a receptionist who talks to you like you are a 5 year old. This week I tried to return a call to the centre but they wouldn't put me through and spoke in a patronising way. When I did eventually made it to get my injection I had to wait outside the building for 10 minutes (luckily it was a nice warm and dry day)while the nurse prepared the injection. My disappointment and anxiety from having to wait was enhanced after the encounter with a nurse who can only have spoken to me at the most 20 words. But NONE of those were asking me how I was. Forgive me if I am wrong but surely as mental health nurses their patients welfare should be up near the top of the list when speaking to them. The fact that I didn't know the nurse is irrelevant if this is a new member of staff surely its a way of getting to know the patients. I have recently gone through and still am struggling. It was obvious my notes hadn't been looked at.  \r\nPreviously I had known a lot of the staff there but they all seem to have moved on. I can only say how disappointed I am in the treatment I have received lately. It has not given me any faith in the team. After speaking to a support worker who tried to say that all was well. It certainly doesn't feel it to me. I have put my story on here because I don't want to make a formal complaint (I am not like that) however if the attitude doesn't change my only way may have to formalise my disappointment.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-08-07T14:50:23.07","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-08-11T10:43:04.307","readBy":[{"name":"Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust","count":22}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/779830","id":"779830"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/779830/responses","id":"779830"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/779830/healthservices","id":"779830"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/779830/tags","id":"779830"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rha-amh-county-ged","id":"rha-amh-county-ged","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/depot","id":"depot"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/injection","id":"injection"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/patronising","id":"patronising"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reception","id":"reception"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attitude","id":"staff attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting","id":"waiting"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20disappointed","id":"very disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20changes","id":"staff changes"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/780303","id":"780303"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/780306","id":"780306"}]},{"id":780262,"author":"Mow Mary Maureen","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"A wonderful job","body":"I attended Hairmyres for cataract and stent surgery to my left eye.

Our desires and preferences were always put first and we felt that our experience was totally unique and catered for us. Despite the current restrictions and strains this must inevitably put on the staff, they showed no sign of it and were the perfect balance of professional and personal throughout our time in the unit. Sarah (midwife) and Sarah (student midwife) were the ideal team encouraging and supporting me through 12 hours of labour in the fabulous birthing pool. Followed by Gemma who brought our gorgeous girl into the world.

But she finally gave in to the pain and went to A& E which is practically next door to her home. She was dealt by a Nurse who was extremely rude and made her feel really small, saying she should not of come to A&E because her toe was not sticking outwards, in a very rude tone and the words \"you're wasting our time\" were used. The way she was spoken to, was disgusting, didn't give much eye contact at all, barely acknowledging her, rushed her out after taping her toe. Implied that she should've known that they don't x-ray toes that aren't sticking out... Like my Grandma was a trained NHS worker.
