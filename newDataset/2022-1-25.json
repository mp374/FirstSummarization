I was struggling to breathe after contracting Covid two weeks before.  \r\nI felt I had mostly recovered from Covid & was feeling much better, then my breathing had deteriorated over the last 48hrs. I was now struggling to speak & breathe, my pulse o2 was at 90 on a home Oximeter & I was beginning to panic when coughing as I couldn't catch my breath.  \r\nI called around 2pm & a Gp called me back within 30mins, I was told I needed to be seen & to attend the surgery that afternoon to see Dr Hay. They had Covid restrictions in place, I was to go to the back door, call reception & Dr Hay would assess me. This all worked flawlessly. I was taken into her room, she throughly listened to my chest, checked my pulse o2, did all of the relevant checks in her usual cheery thoughtful way. At no point did I feel unwelcome, that I was wasting her time or that she was putting me in any danger as she was in full ppe. She took the time to explain to my husband (socially distanced) that I was being referred to the SATA unit at QEUH.  \r\nAs a family we are in almost weekly contact with Midlock Medical Centre and have been throughout the pandemic. Myself, my children & my elderly Grandmother have ongoing health conditions. The care & help we have received from both reception & medical staff has been excellent. From emergency prescriptions, home visit to my Grandmother, advice & a genuine want to help. They really have made a massive difference in what has been a rather terrifying & uncertain time for us & an unbelievably stressful & demanding time for them.  \r\nWe are incredibly grateful for the care they have given and continue to give us.

I have been very unwell and I am slowly recovering from a debilitating depression which I had no idea was coming and I have never experienced this before. I was frightened, paranoid, anxious, ashamed and at times suicidal. I felt very vulnerable and was shocked at how physically fatigued I was. I was at my lowest ebb and in a state of decline which was very frightening. I am 43yrs old and have previously been fit and well both mentally and physically.  \r\nI called my practice and Dr McKee contacted me quickly. He listened to me and reassured me that he could help me. I was so grateful and I was very distressed. He asked me to attend the surgery so that he could talk to me further to establish how he could help me. Even in my distress I remember feeling reassured by his manner on the telephone. I was given a same day appointment and within a couple of hours I was in his consultation room. He immediately reassured me by saying that this was my appointment and to take as much time as I needed. That it was important hear everything that I wanted to say. There was no rush. I could not believe that I had been so lucky to have this support and I knew that there would be no judgement from him. He was very respectful of me and actively listened to my emotional experiences. I remember asking him for reassurance of confidentiality. He was reassured me of this.  \r\nDr Mckee supported me continuously over the last six months with calls every couple of weeks at my request rather than going to the surgery which felt overwhelming to me. He always gave me the option of attending. He worked in partnership with me in relation to my treatment plan. He titrated medication, offered me CBT which has been very helpful, he listened to my experience throughout my journey through depression.  \r\nWhen I reflect on where I was to where I am now I notice that there has been a significant difference. The care, compassion and support that I have received from Dr Mckee has been person-centred and of the highest quality. I will be forever grateful that I was lucky enough to have the highest standard of care during one of the most difficult periods of my life. I will never forget how he treated me and I am so glad that we have genuine, compassionate people such as Dr McKee in the profession,","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-01-25T00:44:42.3933333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-01-25T10:16:31.687","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Ayrshire & Arran","count":6},{"name":"Scottish Government","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/911259","id":"911259"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/911259/responses","id":"911259"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/911259/healthservices","id":"911259"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/911259/tags","id":"911259"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sa9-gp","id":"sa9-gp","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cbt","id":"cbt"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confidentiality","id":"confidentiality"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/depression","id":"depression"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gp","id":"GP"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/listened","id":"listened"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lucky","id":"lucky"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/non%20judgemental","id":"non judgemental"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20rushed","id":"not rushed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/person-centred","id":"person-centred"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/quick%20response","id":"quick response"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/telephone%20manner","id":"telephone manner"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment%20plan","id":"treatment plan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vulnerable","id":"vulnerable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassionate","id":"compassionate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassuring","id":"reassuring"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/911529","id":"911529"}]},{"id":911418,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Worst care ","body":"After having a biopsy I was provided with no after care.

I was very fortunate that evening as Storm Arwen had just arrived, the weather was awful and as a result the attendance at Pilgrim A & E was much lower than normal. I was quickly triaged, then saw the usual practitioners and had only a short wait before being called through to see a doctor.  \r\nThe doctor concerned was Dr Seabrook, clearly a young registrar, and on my first meeting with him I was very impressed by his manner, maturity, confident (but not cocky!) demeanour and his ability to relate to me, convey information and, equally importantly, to listen!  \r\nAfter receiving a tentative diagnosis I was admitted to the relevant ward but saw him again several times over the next few days. He continued to impress me with his professionalism and also demonstrated his caring and considerate nature.  \r\nHis personality and behaviour as a professional inspired total confidence in me with respect to his knowledge and abilities; I had absolutely no doubt that in the event he was uncertain about something or required input from consultant(s) he would not hesitate to ask.  \r\nWhen Dr Seabrook said he would do something (like coming back to see me later to update me on something or to check how I was doing) he followed through, this despite, I am certain, a very hectic schedule!  \r\nI cannot speak too highly of this young doctor who has, I am absolutely certain, a very bright and personally rewarding future ahead of him in the medical world. Well done NHS and Pilgrim Hospital on finding (and hopefully keeping!) this brilliant young man.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-01-22T14:37:41.4533333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-01-25T10:28:11.103","readBy":[{"name":"United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust","count":9}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/910885","id":"910885"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/910885/responses","id":"910885"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/910885/healthservices","id":"910885"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/910885/tags","id":"910885"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rwdla_100","id":"RWDLA_100","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rwdla_180","id":"RWDLA_180","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/caring","id":"caring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/considerate","id":"considerate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diagnosis","id":"diagnosis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctor","id":"doctor"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/information","id":"information"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/knowledge","id":"knowledge"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/listening","id":"listening"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professionalism","id":"professionalism"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happy","id":"happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/promises%20kept","id":"promises kept"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20manner","id":"staff manner"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/quick%20triage","id":"quick triage"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/911982","id":"911982"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/912261","id":"912261"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/912298","id":"912298"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/912447","id":"912447"}]},{"id":911422,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Visit Gastro Unit","body":"I visited Gastro unit for a procedure on the 14th of Dec 2021.

Two weeks later I had a phone call from the receptionist to come in and pick up a Qfit test as I had an iron deficiency. I collected it and returned it next day. Although I had another telephone appointment booked, I received a call 2 days beforehand, whilst at work, from the doctor advising that he suspected I had Bowel Cancer and was making an urgent referral for double scope. He told me this could take up to 5 weeks.  \r\nAfter recovering from the initial shock I discussed this with my family and we scraped the money together to have the endoscope procedures carried out at Ross Hall Hospital in the belief that this would expedite the process. I had a colonoscopy carried out which identified a moderately differentiated caecal adenocarcinoma. My GP was provided with the full details of the procedure including images and a copy of the biopsy report. I was referred to the Colorectal Cancer Pathway at NHS Lanarkshire.  \r\nTwo weeks later, feeling quite anxious at the lack of information, I dropped into the Maggie‚Äôs Centre at Monklands Hospital. The Cancer Support Worker was very helpful and arranged for a nurse from the Colorectal Team to call me the following day. As a result of this I had a CT Scan arranged. I received a call from the Colorectal nurse on Christmas Eve advising that I had been discussed at the MDT meeting that morning and the scan had shown a node on my adrenal gland. I was being referred urgently for a scan of the adrenal gland prior to confirmation of surgery. She said this would take around 2 weeks. After waiting 3 weeks I contacted the Colorectal Team again and was advised they would make another urgent referral. To date I have still not received an appointment for the scan.  \r\nI am now 14 weeks from the urgent referral by my GP and 12 weeks from diagnosis and still have no idea when I can expect any form of treatment plan. During this entire period the only doctor I have seen is the Consultant I paid to carry out the colonoscopy who expressed strongly the urgency that was required.  \r\nI believe that one of the worst things a person can hear is that they have cancer. I expected that on hearing such news there would be a system in place to offer support, keep me informed and an urgency to prevent the cancer from growing and spreading. I feel I have been abandoned and worry that by the time someone actually sees me it will be too late.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-01-23T00:18:19.85","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-01-25T13:51:07.747","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lanarkshire","count":6},{"name":"Scottish Government","count":1},{"name":"Partnership for Change","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/910965","id":"910965"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/910965/responses","id":"910965"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/910965/healthservices","id":"910965"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/910965/tags","id":"910965"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l106h_301","id":"L106H_301","score":3},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l106h-xray-scans","id":"L106H-xray-scans","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sl9-gp","id":"sl9-gp","score":2},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/abandoned","id":"abandoned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxious","id":"anxious"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/worried","id":"worried"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/access%20to%20treatment","id":"access to treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/answers","id":"answers"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bowel%20cancer","id":"bowel cancer"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cancer%20care","id":"cancer care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/colonoscopy","id":"colonoscopy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ct%20scan","id":"CT scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lack%20of%20information","id":"lack of information"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/referral","id":"referral"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting%20times","id":"waiting times"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/911800","id":"911800"}]},{"id":910976,"author":"NatH22","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Wrist fracture","body":"I respect all the staff in the job they do, but I wasn't given any information about aftercare and exercises I need to do regarding improving my recovery. I'm 6 weeks after breaking my wrist, I've just had my cast taken off and only now have I been told about hand and wrist exercises on the website. Looking at the website I should have been stretching fingers and thumb while in cast which I was never told. I see now a web address has been added at the end of your letters, which is really a tag on, an after thought, also it does not tell me to go on the website to do important exercises to improve recovery. The consultant when they saw me the other day was shocked at how stiff my hand and fingers were. Had I been doing the exercises for the last 6 weeks with my fingers maybe I would be further along with finger movements. I am so dissappointed. At this 6wk appointment I was shown exercises to do, but I had to ask for a handout on this, and this was the 1st time the website was mentioned and written down. Surely all this information should have be given at each appointment to ensure I am doing the right exercises to ensure a speedier recovery for me. Whilst in cast I had a few concerns with swelling and went on the internet to find out about elevating hand above the heart or icing cast. Again I feel this is information patients should be informed of. Our telephone numbers when we arrive, if a patient has a mobile number they could send a text with a link to the website explaining exercises to do to improve recovery and for any details regarding your fracture. Just a thought.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-01-23T11:53:23.8466667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-01-25T13:57:50.867","readBy":[{"name":"Royal Cornwall Hospitals NHS Trust","count":6},{"name":"Healthwatch Cornwall","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/910976","id":"910976"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/910976/responses","id":"910976"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/910976/healthservices","id":"910976"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/910976/tags","id":"910976"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/ref12_110","id":"REF12_110","score":3},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disappointed","id":"disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/aftercare","id":"aftercare"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/exercises","id":"exercises"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fracture","id":"fracture"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/information","id":"information"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wrist","id":"wrist"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/aftercare%20advice","id":"aftercare advice"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/911860","id":"911860"}]},{"id":910987,"author":"Katee95","authorRoleId":8,"authorRole":"a staff member posting for a patient/service user","title":"My time in hospital","body":"I am hoping to get out of hospital today, if not, I will be going into my third week on orthopaedics.

There is also no variety in fruit - melon, strawberries etc.  \r\nI also feel that there has been a lack of fresh air - open windows would be nice.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-01-23T18:19:07.9433333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-01-25T14:08:25.31","readBy":[{"name":"Southern Health and Social Care Trust","count":6}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/911020","id":"911020"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/911020/responses","id":"911020"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/911020/healthservices","id":"911020"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/911020/tags","id":"911020"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_33020-medical-m","id":"ZT003_33020-medical-m","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bored","id":"bored"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctors","id":"doctors"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good","id":"good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/food%20variety","id":"food variety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fine","id":"fine"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/open%20windows","id":"open windows"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ability%20to%20exercise","id":"ability to exercise"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/recreation","id":"recreation"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/911462","id":"911462"}]},{"id":911018,"author":"gifttm97","authorRoleId":8,"authorRole":"a staff member posting for a patient/service user","title":"Everything great on Maternity","body":"My time in Daisy Hill Hospital's Maternity Ward has been great so far.  \r\nThe staff have all been absolutely lovely - really approachable and friendly.

His wife and daughter were allowed in one afternoon, as he was being taken off the ventilator.  \r\nThe Dr's didn't know if he would be able to breath on his own. He looked so terribly ill that day.Thankfully he did and is continuing to make progress. We will continue to pray for his recovery üôè  \r\nNo one had been able to see him, because of covid restrictions and he was getting very low. It was also very distressing for his family, not being able to be there with him. We had a virtual visit with him yesterday. It was so lovely for him to be able to see his wife and some of the family. It really lifted his spirits and gave us all a lift, to see him doing better and able to talk with us a little.  \r\nIt's a very difficult time for the family. We know the staff in ICU have been amazing and we are so thankful and although, nothing, beats a visit in person, these virtual visits are priceless!!  \r\nWe are due to have another one today.

The nurse we met was absolutely amazing and she kept my daughter very calm. I met with the surgeon who told me that they would be removing her nail and cleaning it out and if she needed any stitches then this would be done while she was under general anesthetic. We were moved into a ward after her results came back. All staff were very kind to both me and my daughter. The anesthetist came round and recommended that my daughter has a pre med as she has adhd this worked very well and when we went down to the theatre she was very relaxed which helped me to be okay with her going under.
