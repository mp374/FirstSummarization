The crisis team refused to allow me to see one of their psychiatrist and stated I would have to wait to see the CMHT. Due to the wait (I was advised it would be 12 weeks), I had to go private which put me into debt.  \r\nIn January of this year I ended up in hospital due to Lithium Toxicity, I had put off my scheduled appointment with my private psychiatrist as I could not afford it, however having access to a psychiatrist would have prevented my hospital admission. I saw RRLP in hospital who were excellent, they advised they would bump my referral to the CMHT up to urgent. My private psychiatrist had advised both myself and RRLP that he felt I needed the CMHT as he felt his support was not enough for someone in my circumstances. I was therefore discharged having been taken off Lithium and not put on another mood stabiliser.  \r\nTwo weeks later I received my appointment date with the CMHT, - 9 months after I had been originally referred and 3 months after my referral had been made urgent. I was therefore being left unmedicated for 3 months, as I knew this would put my mental health and my employment at serious risk I had to again see a private psychiatrist. I had to borrow money in order to do this, putting myself further into debt. I have recently received a letter putting my appointment further back a further week.  \r\nLeaving someone with Bipolar 9 months to see a psychiatrist after a serious suicide is absolutely appalling.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-03-02T21:08:33.15","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-03-05T09:23:17.953","readBy":[{"name":"Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust","count":16}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/828997","id":"828997"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/828997/responses","id":"828997"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/828997/healthservices","id":"828997"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/828997/tags","id":"828997"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rha-amh-county-ashfield","id":"rha-amh-county-ashfield","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rk5","id":"RK5","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/badly%20let%20down","id":"badly let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/discarded","id":"discarded"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appalling%20treatment","id":"appalling treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bipolar","id":"bipolar"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cmht","id":"cmht"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/crisis%20team","id":"Crisis Team"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lithium","id":"lithium"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/psychiatry","id":"psychiatry"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/suicide","id":"suicide"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting%20times","id":"waiting times"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/budget%20cuts","id":"budget cuts"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/just%20left%20to%20struggle","id":"just left to struggle"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/831062","id":"831062"}]},{"id":829221,"author":"Ellhj83","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"I felt my vaccinator didn't believe me","body":"All the staff couldn't have been more pleasant and helpful except my vaccinator.

I relied on her for those occasions when phone calls are received. I now live on my own.  \r\nIn January 2021 I attended an annual health review requested by my GP. I was given a form for several blood tests to be carried out. Due to Covid restrictions appointments have to be booked by phone or on line in advance. As I am deaf the phone option is not available especially bearing in mind the phenomenally long call waiting times. Asking someone not close to me to phone was not an option. That should have been OK as there is an option to book on line. However on going to the site and submitting the request it turned out the ONLY option available was to wait up to two days to receive a CALLBACK on my phone. If it was not answered promptly I would lose the option to receive whatever the call back was arranging and will have to PHONE in the usual way. There is no alternative way provided for a deaf person alone to arrange the booking appointment.  \r\nNo option for email or text is provided. I have complained to PALS NHS Lewisham and Greenwich area and have been contacted in March by them informing me that the phlebotomy department has been sent my email address and hopefully will contact me soon (I am writing this in March and am still awaiting a reply).  \r\nEarlier today while my mobile was in another room at home I receive a phone call from a number a recognize as QE2 Hospital Woolwich. From experience dealing with it while my wife was dying I know it's one of those \"press number X for whatever you require\" contact numbers this is no good to me of course.  \r\nI had no alternative but to go back to my GP reception in person and tell them it was impossible for a deaf person to book a phlebotomy appointment by themselves.  \r\nThe receptionist understood my plight and the impossible situation I was in. She phoned the number for booking an appointment. After a few minutes she was told that she was number 44 in the queue. Obviously, the receptionist like a previous person I asked to help couldn't wait that long as other people were awaiting her attention. She finally gave me an appointment at the Gallions Health Centre itself, for the earliest available there on 15th March virtually another two weeks away. Hopefully I don't have any blood conditions that will require immediate attention.  \r\nAs a profoundly deaf person now on my own, I am finding this a common problem. All too often no alternative to arranging things by phone is provided. Today's technology emails and text should be routine. When my wife died I informed my Health Centre to make a note on my records to contact me by text when they want me to arrange something with them. As I would miss requests to attend for example flu vaccinations normally via landline phone which I no longer use.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-03-03T12:19:34.2833333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-03-05T11:08:22.537","readBy":[{"name":"Lewisham and Greenwich NHS Trust","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/829144","id":"829144"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/829144/responses","id":"829144"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/829144/healthservices","id":"829144"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/829144/tags","id":"829144"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rj231_300","id":"RJ231_300","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/alone","id":"alone"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20tests","id":"blood tests"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/deaf","id":"deaf"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hearing","id":"hearing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20good","id":"not good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pals","id":"pals"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/special","id":"special"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/text%20messaging","id":"text messaging"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/email%20service","id":"email service"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/offered%20alternatives","id":"offered alternatives"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/a%20way%20for%20deaf%20people%20to%20make%20bookings","id":"a way for deaf people to make bookings"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/locked%20out","id":"locked out"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/834524","id":"834524"}]},{"id":829203,"author":"heva35","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Brilliant care in difficult times","body":"8 weeks ago I under went a hysterectomy at Whiston Hospital.

A few visits, a long wait between - and treatment offered did little or nothing to help - eg. use of Tens machine, steroid injection to the hip, etc.  Before 1st lockdown, another steroid injecton discussed and agreed.  Since then, all I have heard about it was a call just before Christmas to see if I still wanted it.

When I was a child I was both sexually abused and physically abused in Ireland. This was from two until I was about 12. I then married at 16 to get away from both the abuse, and the whole town who alienated me . I had a very lonely life. The man I married was another abuser. I was beaten regularly. I had two children but lost seven. We split when I was 21. In Ireland then there was no provision for a woman with two children. We were basically a mans possession. My husband took the two children put one in a orphanage and gave one to his brother.  \r\nI moved to Britain. I suffered dreadfully with my mental health. I was diagnosed with Borderline Personally Disorder, Endogenous depression, and Post Traumatic Stress disorder. Never had any help from mental health authorities. Other than sending a psychiatric nurse. Who could not diagnose a cold. I attempted suicide too many times, unfortunately never successfully.  \r\nI had my first stroke in my 30’s, I then had a heart attack, and a second mini stroke. When I got in my mid 40’s I needed help with physical things like washing, dressing, etc, This is when I got in contact with Trafford Adult Social Service. Since then my life has been a living hell. I am now terminally ill. Every time I contact them they treat me like rubbish. There tone is very aggressive, because of my stroke my memory is not great. I need 24 hour care. I get 32 a week. I asked for a little more help. I got a call, asking what I do with the 32 hours, I was trying to remember everything, I was told they don’t allow three quarters of an hour for washing, dressing, breakfast. I explained I can’t go any quicker and that when they access they send two carers, but they expect one carer to do it in the same time. I was then asked if I had filled in some chc form with my GP. I don’t even know what there on about. I was never dying before now. I am then told to ring my GP to chase up McMillan nurses. I can’t even get out of bed. They have no empathy in my last months. I am at the stage now, that I want to cancel all care. It just brings the end quicker. I need help not a jobs worth. Maybe then they might consider how they are treating people. But I am sure they will come out with their usual excuse “lessons to be learned”. But I can’t take anymore fighting for some help. I think my choice of cancelling everything , if nothing else gives me some peace.  \r\nI would like to say thank you, to them, but to be honest, I can’t, from they one they never even took in to account there own social workers assessment of the care I needed. I have multiple co- morbidities , epilepsy, pherephial neuropathy, osteoporosis. COPD, emphysema, asthma, angina, heart disease, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, can’t walk, can’t open my front door, can’t get any shopping, can’t wash, can’t dress, can’t get any shopping delivered, who is going to open the door. Breathless just sitting, Maybe when they see what their actions do to people they might just think a little before they drive the next person to giving up.","criticality":"strongly

It affected my physical health as well as emotional health, which resulted in me losing weight, losing my hair and generally becoming unwell which resulted in having to go to hospital.  \r\nI was diagnosed with depression in 2019 and I was put on anti-depressants. I felt so sad and like my life was spiralling out of control, I felt I didn’t have no control in my life and that I had lost who I was. I full of anger and hurt from what I had been through. I had had counselling on and off throughout the last few years but last year become a breaking point for me and I went back to Inclusion and started having counselling again last July.  \r\nMy counsellor was Ian. We would have counselling every week via telephone. He helped me to see what was positive in my life and the positivity in myself. He also suggested some great things to help which was writing my feelings down when I felt sad or angry and even watching videos to help with my emotions. Every couple of weeks, my anxiety scores would go up or go down, due to having a bad week here and there but Ian would help bring them back down. All I needed was someone to listen to me whether if I was crying or angry and Ian was there to listen. I had had counselling for roughly 7-8 months with Ian, it really benefitted me having it for as long as I did as it’s helped me to turn my life around now.  \r\nI am much happier now, I have gained a little more weight, I eat more and I don’t feel as depressed like I used to. I still have down days here and there but Ian taught me that this is normal and that if I feel like I need to speak to someone again, I can ring Inclusion and ask for him. Thank you Ian and Inclusion service for your help and for helping turn my life around.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-03-03T15:04:22.74","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-03-05T11:50:34.42","readBy":[{"name":"Midlands Partnership NHS Foundation Trust","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/829237","id":"829237"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/829237/responses","id":"829237"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/829237/healthservices","id":"829237"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/829237/tags","id":"829237"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rrex4-inclusion-thurrock","id":"rrex4-inclusion-thurrock","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/counsellor","id":"counsellor"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emotional%20support","id":"emotional support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happier","id":"happier"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/positivity","id":"Positivity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/contactable","id":"contactable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/listened%20to","id":"listened to"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/832702","id":"832702"}]},{"id":829274,"author":"Mairiemeg","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Dvt.

His GP agreed to send off the referral and was very sympathetic, but for some reason the mental health team is refusing to see him. These refusals are contributing to other issues, such as depression, which is also very common in undiagnosed ADHD patients.  \r\nHe was initially referred around 3 years or so ago to the Dr at Woodlands to discuss depression and ADHD, which as I detailed in my email to the GP, did not go very well as he struggles to advocate for himself in high pressure scenarios and masks his ADHD symptoms in these situations in an attempt to focus on the situation at hand and answer the questions. This led to the Dr deciding without completing any diagnostic questionnaires that he did not have ADHD. I went with him to the recall appointment a few weeks later and asked specifically about ADHD and the Dr was incredibly rude and dismissive towards me and refused to discuss it. We were unhappy with this experience as the Dr acted pretty horribly but unsure what to do next.  \r\nMy husband's symptoms are still present and he struggles with everyday life as a result, and his GP made the referral. We spoke to the GP surgery today as we had heard nothing back, who gave us another number for the FVRH psychiatry team to chase the referral. They were confused why it hadn’t been referred to them and couldn’t give us any other information other than the name of someone who had been knocking back the referrals and they didn’t know why, and were confused about why he was instead referred to Woodlands. We are being given the run-around and can’t get in touch with anyone at Woodlands to actually discuss this as their phone is just ringing out.  \r\nThis refusal to provide him with any care is abhorrent and is forcing us to have to save money for however long it takes to pay for private diagnosis (we can't afford this), and then we have to hope that shared care is available, which it generally is not. I cannot afford to be saving upwards of £1000 simply because the NHS is failing him. It's disgusting.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-03-03T15:54:15.24","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-03-05T12:04:58.44","readBy":[{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2021)","count":1},{"name":"NHS Forth Valley","count":4}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/829244","id":"829244"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/829244/responses","id":"829244"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/829244/healthservices","id":"829244"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/829244/tags","id":"829244"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/falkirk-ch-woodlands","id":"falkirk-ch-woodlands","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/angry","id":"angry"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disappointed","id":"disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/access%20to%20mental%20health%20services","id":"access to mental health services"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/adhd","id":"adhd"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication%20between%20services","id":"communication between services"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dismissed","id":"dismissed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gp","id":"GP"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/psychiatry","id":"psychiatry"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/referral%20process","id":"referral process"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unhappy","id":"unhappy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/no%20hope","id":"no hope"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/831639","id":"831639"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/839370","id":"839370"}]},{"id":829894,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Professional and caring ","body":"I was naturally anxious when I was advised to have a partial knee replacement, but my concerns were soon put to rest on entering the hospital.

It is not acceptable to have to continuously keep calling.  Other GPS telephone systems tell you what position that you are waiting to be answered in.  Although, this can be a wait, at least you have an idea of what wait you have.  I had to actually go in the GP to book appointment because I could not get through on the telephone.  Then I could not get through to cancel and appointment.  Which seems very sad because someone else could of had my appointment who needed it.  All because the telephone system is rubbish.  GP surgery inside is pleasant enough.   And I was able to get 2 GP appointments quite fast as I needed them quick.  So they are some positive thing.  It’s a shame the telephone system lets the whole place down.  The internet site needs sorting out as not working.  Maybe this could be an easy way to cancel appointments if needed.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2019-10-07T16:14:13","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-03-05T13:38:32","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/829901","id":"829901"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/829901/responses","id":"829901"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/829901/healthservices","id":"829901"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/829901/tags","id":"829901"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/c81087","id":"C81087","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sad","id":"sad"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good","id":"good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20good","id":"not good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/positive","id":"positive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/830152","id":"830152"}]},{"id":829317,"author":"Nelli2018","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Fibromyalgia","body":"I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia 3 years ago.

Before I was diagnosed I worked 7 days a week and was always busy doing something and helping others. But my life had changed so much in the 3 years since I was diagnosed. All I was doing was sleeping and working, only managing to work monday till friday and it was a struggle. Then I was referred to an Occupational Therapist on October 2020. What a diffrence to my life that has made. Even just havin someone to talk to and beleive in your pain, made a big difference. I have now got a diffrent outlook on life and being able to manage my pain a bit better. I still have appointments with my OT every week and she is great at helping me manage my pain and listening to me. I was off work for 12 weeks and she organised a return to work on shorter hours and gradually building it back up to 5 days. This would never have happened if I didn't have my OT as I have worked in my job for 37 years and I am the 1st person to work these hours through an OT. Without her I would be in a much darker place and In a lot more pain and just getting by with my life. She has made a massive difference to my life now and I am so grateful that she's there for me and still is.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-03-03T20:14:31.8","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-03-05T13:39:41.053","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lanarkshire","count":6}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/829317","id":"829317"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/829317/responses","id":"829317"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/829317/healthservices","id":"829317"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/829317/tags","id":"829317"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sl9-occupational-therapy","id":"SL9-occupational-therapy","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fibromyalgia","id":"fibromyalgia"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/occupational%20therapist","id":"occupational therapist"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain%20management%20information","id":"pain management information"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/someone%20to%20talk%20to","id":"someone to talk to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/829911","id":"829911"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/830404","id":"830404"}]},{"id":829345,"author":"Angry asthmatic","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Shocking receptionist","body":"I said excuse me to receptionist had been up 2 times she didn’t even lift her head and acknowledge me, casualty wasn’t really that busy been here hours after arriving in ambulance a bit of manners would have been appreciated  \r\nUtter disgust at their behaviour I will be taking this further","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-03-04T00:15:45.0133333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-03-05T13:43:08.08","readBy":[{"name":"Southern Health and Social Care Trust","count":8}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/829345","id":"829345"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/829345/responses","id":"829345"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/829345/healthservices","id":"829345"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/829345/tags","id":"829345"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003-dhho-respiratory","id":"zt003-dhho-respiratory","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ignored","id":"ignored"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/asthma","id":"asthma"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attitude","id":"staff attitude"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/830793","id":"830793"}]},{"id":829422,"author":"FeedbackMarch","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Cancelling Surgery Last Minute","body":"My partner's mother has been crippled most of 3 years, she finally gets her operation date which means soon she can finally hold and care for her new grandchild to help me through this pandemic whilst my partner works away amongst other normal things like sleep and walk properly without pain.

I noticed symptoms of autism and adhd between 2019 and 2020. the symptoms have been there since I was a child but due to family issues I was unable to start the process until I was in my 20s. When I went to my gp about this I was told (even though I had proof of the autism test online and adhd test online) that autism is not seen in females and was dismissed until september 2020 when I phoned again to get an assessment.  \r\nI have also had problems being put on the right medication. I am on antidepressants and have now been on 3 different ones with all results showing that they are not working. I have had to fight each time and unless I have had a male with me nothing has been changed. the most recent was when my partner had to go with me to get my medication changed to no avail as I was told my mental issues are down to my weight (I am overweight but not morbidly and am working to lose weight for my own sake) and that if I lost weight I wouldn't be depressed or anxious. when in psychology I have brought up the fact that I think I might have autism and adhd I feel like that has been pushed to the side and all that psychology and psychiatry has focused on is childhood trauma from my mum dying in front of me and other issues with my dad.  \r\nI feel like its a vicious cycle of telling my gp that my mental issues are here and not trauma related him saying that it's my weight and me getting annoyed at not being heard. I'm doing my HNC in applied science and one of my essays is on Neurodiversity so I'm not just a stupid little girl that doesn't know any better I have done the research for my own sake and being graded on my knowledge of this. I need him to listen instead of dismissing me even when the severity of my mental issues are on show ( I have self harm scars because that is the only way I knew how to deal with my issues). sorry for the long ramble but I am sick of being dismissed for being overweight and what genitals I have.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-03-04T01:31:33.8266667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-03-05T14:27:50.6","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/829349","id":"829349"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/829349/responses","id":"829349"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/829349/healthservices","id":"829349"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/829349/tags","id":"829349"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sj9-general-practices","id":"sj9-general-practices","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/annoyed","id":"annoyed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxious","id":"anxious"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20listened%20to","id":"not listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/should%20listen","id":"Should listen"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/adhd","id":"adhd"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/antidepressants","id":"antidepressants"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/autism","id":"autism"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/depression","id":"depression"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dismissed","id":"dismissed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctors%20approach","id":"doctors approach"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gender","id":"Gender"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/overweight","id":"overweight"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/self%20harm","id":"self harm"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/weight","id":"weight"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dont%20be%20biased","id":"dont be biased"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pushed%20out","id":"pushed out"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/829923","id":"829923"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/830114","id":"830114"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/830445","id":"830445"}]},{"id":829424,"author":"charliemc69","authorRoleId":4,"authorRole":"a relative","title":"Pre-assessment Appointment","body":"I care for my Dad and took him to his pre-assessment appointment.

He was left on a corridor still on the Gynae until the next morning. Nobody came to see him. The lights were switched out and was obviously forgotten about. He was finally admitted to ward the following morning where he had all the necessary obs. This happened for 10 days until they discharged him. There was no scans done nothing!  \r\nIt was obvious there had been a lack of oxygen to his brain. I went to collect him to find him wandering down the corridor confused and wobbling as though he was drunk. He didn't recognise me. He had a blank expression in his face. I said surely they haven't discharged you in this state. He said they had. It took me a while to get him to the car. Thinking he had discharged himself! I phoned the hospital to see if they had discharged him. Yes they said. Surely not in this state I thought.  \r\nHe began to recover but found that part of his memory had gone. After finally having Mri and Ct scans they were lesions that were found in his brain. To cut a long story short he has had another stroke this time I took him to Barnsley hospital. They were on the ball from the start. He has lost feeling all down one side and his eyesight has gone. He is now suppose to be in Rehab Kendray refused to take him because his doctors are in Wath. But we live under Barnsley council! Ridiculous red tape. He has now been transferred back to Rotherham and is back on the stroke ward... Worried is an understatement after seeing first hand how my partner was treated as an elderly stroke survivor! I witnessed other people not being helped to eat or drink even though they couldn't do it themselves. I am so worried he will not make a recovery if things haven't changed! Feeling sick to my stomach and have no confidence in Rotherham Hospital whatsoever.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-03-04T08:36:45.3666667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-03-05T14:40:18.507","readBy":[{"name":"Sheffield Hallam University, Nursing BSc (20-9)","count":2},{"name":"Barnsley Hospital NHS Foundation Trust","count":1},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2021)","count":1},{"name":"South West Yorkshire Partnership NHS Foundation Trust","count":1},{"name":"The Rotherham NHS Foundation Trust","count":1},{"name":"Sheffield Hallam University, Nursing BSc (21-9)","count":1},{"name":"The Stroke Association","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/829430","id":"829430"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/829430/responses","id":"829430"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/829430/healthservices","id":"829430"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/829430/tags","id":"829430"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rffaa_300","id":"RFFAA_300","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rfrpa_180","id":"RFRPA_180","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rfrpa_300","id":"RFRPA_300","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rxgx4","id":"RXGX4","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/worried","id":"worried"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/attention","id":"attention"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bedside%20manner","id":"bedside manner"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/brain","id":"brain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ct","id":"ct"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/elderly","id":"elderly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/eyesight","id":"eyesight"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hospital%20discharge","id":"hospital discharge"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mri","id":"mri"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/oxygen","id":"oxygen"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stroke","id":"stroke"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/service%20boundaries","id":"service boundaries"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/no%20confidence","id":"no confidence"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/access%20to%20specialist%20services","id":"access to specialist services"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/830394","id":"830394"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/830585","id":"830585"}]},{"id":829434,"author":"muscapm68","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Covid Vaccine at allergy clinic","body":"I was unable to book at South Lake centre due to not being suitable for Pfizer vaccine.

I discussed the possibility of being diagnosed with Lynch Syndrome as this was a possibility given my maternal family medical conditions.  \r\nI was impressed with the advice and ongoing support put in place to support me with my diagnosis of Kidney Cancer, during a Covid Pandemic and difficult time for all Staff within the Victoria Hospital and I'm so thankful for their care and support during this surreal time.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-03-04T09:36:55.4833333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-03-05T14:43:54.007","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Fife","count":18},{"name":"Fife Health & Social Care Partnership","count":3},{"name":"St. Andrews University ScotGEM Medical Students","count":1},{"name":"Scottish Government","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/829437","id":"829437"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/829437/responses","id":"829437"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/829437/healthservices","id":"829437"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/829437/tags","id":"829437"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/f704h_101","id":"F704H_101","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/f704h_502","id":"F704H_502","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/advice","id":"advice"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cancer","id":"cancer"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ct","id":"ct"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ct%20scan","id":"CT scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diagnosis","id":"diagnosis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency","id":"emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gynae","id":"gynae"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kidney","id":"kidney"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kidney%20cancer","id":"kidney cancer"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ongoing%20care","id":"ongoing care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ongoing%20support","id":"Ongoing support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scan","id":"scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing","id":"amazing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/impressed","id":"impressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported","id":"supported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thankful","id":"Thankful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pandemic","id":"pandemic"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/830307","id":"830307"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/830382","id":"830382"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/830390","id":"830390"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/830407","id":"830407"}]},{"id":829439,"author":"Millington","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"About my uncle","body":"My uncle went into Daisyhill on Sunday. later that evening I phoned and asked the nurse about him and could I speak to him.

I was under the care of the HDU dept for 2 weeks where I was unaware of much due to sedation but I was aware that I was being cared for well.. I was then transferred to ICU and intubated for a week. My wife and family were kept up to date at all times by the excellent Doctors and nurses on both units and I was able to listen to them on the telephone. I particularly remember Margaret and Cheryl as 2 of the many nurses caring for me. After one week an attempt to extubate me was unsuccessful which led to a further week ventilated.  \r\nI was eventually transferred to a Covid ward where the very hard working nurses were always on hand to assist.

For over 20 years, I have attended the RAH in Paisley for Crohn’s Disease. During that time, I have seen an improvement in the service provided to patients since the set up of the IBD Helpline.  \r\nVia the helpline, the brilliant Alan, Seth and Fiona provide invaluable advice re medication and the management of symptoms but, equally important, they provide reassurance when my Crohn’s is bad and I feel at my lowest ebb. The communication and co-ordination between the IBD nurses and my consultant, Dr Naismith, is excellent. I’m sure many people have experienced doctors with a paternal attitude who simply dictate what our treatment should be but Dr Naismith always listens to my opinions and concerns and discusses my options. He takes time to explain new treatments and is always honest about the likelihood of success of such treatments. Dr Naismith’s secretary, Karen, should also get a mention for being lovely, helpful and professional.I can’t thank Dr Naismith’s IBD team enough for the care I’ve had over the years, nor can I over emphasise the importance of having access to such a team.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-03-04T14:29:24.77","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-03-05T15:23:38.007","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":4},{"name":"Scottish Government","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/829545","id":"829545"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/829545/responses","id":"829545"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/829545/healthservices","id":"829545"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/829545/tags","id":"829545"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/c418h-gastroenterology","id":"c418h-gastroenterology","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/brilliant","id":"brilliant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/consultant","id":"consultant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helpful","id":"helpful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helpline","id":"helpline"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ibd","id":"ibd"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/important","id":"important"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professional","id":"professional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/receptionist","id":"receptionist"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thorough%20explanations","id":"thorough explanations"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/crohn's%20disease","id":"crohn's disease"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/831433","id":"831433"}]},{"id":829548,"author":"Blakey66","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"NHS Borders ( BGH )","body":"I was admitted to the Borders General Hospital with a suspected minor stroke & ongoing cardio problems.  \r\nI could not of wished to be looked after by a better team.

We are so unbelievably grateful to all the maternity staff for the amazing level of care we received during the 4 days I was in hospital. I had an induction on the Sunday and my waters were broken on the Tuesday night. After an extremely long, painful and traumatic 15 hours of labour, I had to have an emergency c section to deliver my son. The level of care I received from the Sunday right through to when we left the hospital on the Thursday evening was phenomenal. It was a very traumatic time for me and my partner and my son and the maternity staff took the best care of us and were with us supporting us the entire time. The maternity staff do amazing jobs, let alone during a pandemic, which you would not have known was going on outside as the level of care, professionalism and attention each and every midwife gave us was second to none. I want to say the most special thanks to Ann the staff midwife who was with us during the 15 hour labour, c section and after care for me, my partner and my son. With Ann was midwife Diane who was on placement from Shetlands, they took the best care of us and we genuinely could not have done it without them. To Katie, our doctor who safely delivered our son, again you are such a special person and did a wonderful job. To the anesthetists who were with us during the c section, John and Fintan, your support in keeping me calm and taking fantastic care of me the whole time, thank you thank you thank you!! . You are all truly wonderful people and are amazing at what you do, you are very very special people who we will never forget.  \r\nThank you so so very much  \r\n","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-03-04T15:25:54.1366667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-03-05T15:54:40.497","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":7}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/829558","id":"829558"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/829558/responses","id":"829558"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/829558/healthservices","id":"829558"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/829558/tags","id":"829558"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sj9qe-501","id":"sj9qe-501","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anaesthetist","id":"anaesthetist"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/attention","id":"attention"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/birth","id":"birth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/c%20section","id":"c section"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/caring","id":"caring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency","id":"emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/induction","id":"induction"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/labour","id":"labour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/level%20of%20care","id":"level of care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/maternity","id":"maternity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/midwives","id":"midwives"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professional","id":"professional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/section","id":"section"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing","id":"amazing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/calm","id":"calm"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fantastic","id":"fantastic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wonderful","id":"wonderful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thanks","id":"thanks"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pandemic","id":"pandemic"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/830481","id":"830481"}]},{"id":829579,"author":"Patient1957","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Vaccination","body":"Both my wife and myself are in our 60s with underlying health conditions but still await vaccination I personally know of others in other health boards who are in their 50s with no health conditions who have already been vaccinated.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-03-04T18:14:49.8766667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-03-05T15:57:39.297","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Forth Valley","count":3}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/829579","id":"829579"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/829579/responses","id":"829579"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/829579/healthservices","id":"829579"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/829579/tags","id":"829579"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sv9-cvp","id":"SV9-CVP","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vaccination","id":"vaccination"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting","id":"waiting"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/830722","id":"830722"}]},{"id":829491,"author":"lm1990","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"TMJ Surgery","body":"I was admitted to Ward 62 at the institute of neurological sciences on 3/3/2021 for TMJ disc repositioning under the care of Mr Halsnad.  \r\nI would just like to express my thanks to Mr Halsnad and his team, he kept me well informed and comfortable throughout, explaining the procedure thoroughly and detailing what had been done following on from the procedure.

I was admitted to the hospital for surgery and stayed overnight. It’s a frightening thing going into hospital and under a general Anaesthetic. I was under Mr Mcllhenny who was fantastic. When I went for my ore-op appointment with him he said my operation would be at the end of February. True to his word I went in on the 3rd of March only a few days Later. From admission to discharge I can only say my experience was amazing. I would like to say a big thank you to all the staff in a Larbert involved in my care from the Consultant/Surgeon, nurses, doctors, staff who prepped me in the side room before theatre, theatre staff, my surgeon, the staff in recovery to all the staff in the day ward of Forth Valley Hospital in Larbert who looked after me. I was in on 3rd March to 4th of March. I think you are all wonderful and I’ve never met such wonderful professional bunch of people. I was pretty nervous but they made me feel welcome. I also felt extremely safe in all of their hands. They looked after me so well I can’t thank everyone enough. 💯 % was given by every member of staff including the staff who cleaned my room to the staff who brought my food thank you all so much I mean this from the bottom of my heart. It’s not often you meet a team of people who are all so great that’s the reason no individual names are mentioned here because there would be to many to mention with all the shift changes I saw. You are all fantastic. I can’t forget the nurse who showed me the way into the ward when I was lost. It was the very same nurse who carried my bag downstairs to meet my husband on my discharge he was Irish. I feel quite emotional as I’m writing this because without all of you where would we all be. You all do a fantastic job in extremely difficult times and I just wanted to say to all of you from the bottom of my heart ❤️ To Mr Mcllhenny and his team thank you all so much for looking after me with such professionalism and care.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-03-05T11:52:44.8","progress":"Story has a

exclusively over the phone and so i have my spouse listen in to help explain anything i may not have heard or heard wrong. dr wanted to speak to either me or spouse so i had to do the call myself without spouse to interpret. the audio quality made it difficult to hear what he said and so i had to ask him to repeat a lot.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2021-02-22T11:45:45","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2021-03-05T16:24:58","readBy":[{"name":"Healthwatch
