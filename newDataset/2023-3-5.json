I had a very long labour and was then considered high risk. The maternity team ensured a calm birthing environment. Unfortunately, we did require intervention but our options were discussed and our wishes were adhered to. Our daughter was born after an emergency c section and required some assistance breathing and had to be moved to neonatal intensive care. The staff on the maternity ward were so kind as I was inevitably very upset and scared about what that meant for our newborn. They were extremely busy but the support was incredible.\nI received a lot of support with breastfeeding from both the maternity and neonatal team. I don’t think it would’ve been possible without their support and I am eternally grateful. \nAll of the staff we encountered during our time there went above and beyond what I expected and in difficult circumstances with it being a very busy time. \nI owe everything to both the maternity and neonatal staff. Thank you for saving our daughter!\nAlthough we didn’t have the birth we perhaps wanted, the experience was made a positive one because of the support we had after our daughters difficult start to life. She is now 7months old and thriving. \nI also received birth trauma counselling and this was so beneficial for me to process everything that had happened. \nThe birth debrief was also so helpful to understand what had happened and why. Again, I am very grateful for this. It helped me understand things I didn’t know or had forgotten in the haze of our labour and birth.\nThank you to everyone who helped and supported us during this difficult time!\n","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2023-03-04T11:14:41","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-03-05T13:54:09","readBy":[{"name":"The Dudley Group NHS Foundation

The system for booking an appointment to see a nurse or a doctor is dreadful. You have to be determined, because if you don’t contact them before 10am - either by waiting in a phone queue or logging in online, then the system is full. If you try to make a less urgent appointment for a future date, you can’t because, the cut-off date is 3 weeks away.\nI have noticed mistakes happening and increased meanness when it comes to writing out prescriptions for my child’s eczema treatment. After my last HRT check (which they insist is every 3 months now, rather than every 6) I had a text telling me  to make an additional appointment just to check my blood pressure. \nThey insist the system is to make patient care more efficient, but I can’t believe it’s more efficient for the GPs.

Secondly, because I am fed up of hearing people complaining about not being able to see their GP and criticising the Doctors as if they are sitting in the practice twiddling their thumbs, doing no work when they are as stretched as every part of the health service is at the moment!  \r\nI have always been able to get through to the practice on the telephone to book appointments (though it takes patience) and have been seen face to face during the pandemic when the doctor feels it is appropriate. The practice staff even organized and vaccinated my elderly, mother-in-law for covid when she was staying here from England during the pandemic (before her HSC registration was threw), in case she missed her vaccination and became ill. They were very kind and welcoming to her for those 9 months, providing all her prescribed medicines.  \r\nRecently, Glendermott have 're-opened' their practice and are having routine face-to-face appointments again. However, i feel some conditions could be managed or reviewed by telephone appointments so i hope this will be an option for people with mobility, transport issues and those who have difficulty getting out of work. I don't want to name all the staff who have been outstanding in their work but I feel the reception and telephonist staff deserve a special mention as they face a lot of unnecessary abuse and rudeness while just doing their jobs.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-02-28T14:58:31.01","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2023-03-05T15:20:00.463","readBy":[],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1035764","id":"1035764"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1035764/responses","id":"1035764"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1035764/healthservices","id":"1035764"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1035764/tags","id":"1035764"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/nigp-pw0014","id":"nigp-pw0014","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/depression","id":"depression"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/elderly","id":"elderly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gp%20service","id":"GP service"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/great%20service","id":"great service"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kind","id":"kind"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/listening","id":"listening"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/me","id":"ME"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/physio","id":"physio"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/responsive","id":"responsive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vaccination","id":"vaccination"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/welcoming","id":"welcoming"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/well%20looked%20after","id":"well looked after"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20for","id":"cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/patience","id":"patience"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pandemic","id":"pandemic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/telephone%20appointments","id":"telephone appointments"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/face-to-face%20appointments","id":"face-to-face appointments"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/responding%20to%20concerns","id":"responding to concerns"}]},{"id":1037897,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Waste of time ","body":"This is my second experience of using this service within 3 years and it was useless and stressful both times. You can tell they are simply following a data input and reading out the instructions - there appears to be no listening to the patient or divergent from their script. I was trying to avoid a long wait time in A&E for my grandparent who’d injured their arm and requested the 2 hour urgent care referral which the NHS website said we qualified for and just to phone 111. Instead I was told we didn’t qualify and to go to a walk-in centre. I said we would go to one in the south of the city as I know they have a huge range of facilities and departments. But the 111 person insisted we go to a different centre because that’s what the screen was telling them. When I refused, they made me feel like I was going to be in trouble and said they’d have to pass me to their supervisor because I was potentially putting my grandparent at risk! I said I wasn’t refusing him treatment, I was simply going to the south centre rather than the one they said. Long story short, I went to the centre they told me to where, lo and behold, they didn’t have the facilities to deal with the injury. From there we were referred somewhere else and basically 6 hours and 3 walk-in centres later, we ended up at the south centre that I originally wanted to go to because they were the only one that had the facilities we needed. It’s an absolute joke. Even the doctor at the centre commented how terrible 111 are and that they spend a lot of time redirecting patients elsewhere due to 111 not getting it right. My poor elderly grandparent spent a lot of unnecessary time in pain and discomfort.

Five days between consultation and operation.

My surgeon even told me what he was doing as he replaced my lens during the procedure which I found very reassuring. \nThe discharge process was quick and efficient with all the information I needed to medicate the affected eye. I was at home within two hours (just)  of leaving home. \nAlthough I had to keep the eye covered with a transparent patch until the following morning it was no more than a minor inconvenience. I had no problem sleeping with it in place. \nThe following day I had a lens removed from my glasses and my sight was sufficient to easily meet the requirements of the DVLA though it was a day later that I drove again without any problem. \nI bought a pair of cheap, off-the-peg reading glasses to use until my sight finally settles down after the second eye is done. \nEven now, there is no administrative work I need to do. The interaction between SpaMedica, my optician and myself will happen without me having to initiate anything. \nOverall, a very good experience with absolutely no adverse criticism at all. Oh!

Everyone has bad days but when you are employed in a position to help people with health issues, pain, concerns etc. understanding is required.\n\nYou don't shout a patient down, or speak sarcastically to them when they have very genuine concerns.  A quick look at the patient's health record (always available) will soon confirm that they have a genuine reason to contact the surgery.  After all, no one wants to have health issues.\n\nI think there are two main issues with Central Surgery:\n\nOne is when a patient has multiple health issues and requires regular follow-up and monitoring.  I appreciate there will be many things to keep on top of in these situations; however, I understand that there are wonderful ITsystems in place that can facilitate this.\n\nThe other issue is that the practice is managed by business people.  How could a business person with no medical experience be expected to understand how patients might be feeling and the patients' particular concerns?  \n\nThe above is not a criticism; however it needs to be addressed, because that attitude goes right down the line (e.g. to trainees etc.)\n\nThe amazing Clinical and Admin staff who actually take the time to go the extra mile for us patients are victims of their own success - as they are the people who are repeatedly recommended.\n\nI once asked how I could contact one of the Partner GPs and was advised I wouldn't be able to do that directly as it had to go through Admin.  That is not acceptable.  \n\nMy concern was genuine, potentially urgent and was in connection with ongoing health issues.

I knew before the procedure as I had a biopsy before but not the added pain of the camera. You are advised to take paracetomol beforehand which is a mild pain-kilker and was ineffective for severe pain. I have a high pain threshold, but the pain was awful and many women have to have the procedure stopped due to severe pain. I feel it is nothing short of a scandal that women are still being put through this.  \r\nThe hospital I went to offered no other pain relief besides advising to take paracetomol beforehand. This needs to change. You need strong pain relief for this procedure as it is an operative procedure. Women should not be told that the pain will just be period like and the NHS should offer stronger pain relief and sedation.

service user","title":"Lacks continuity of care","body":"Despite working around the ethos of 'your support your way', this does not apply to the provision of care at the Arran centre. I feel the type and level of care is formulated around an established framework designed for the benefit of staff and perhaps some patients. As a result of this I feel continuity of care does, to a great extent, not exist and significant changes to mental health needs are therefore not recognised and not followed up.  \r\nWhen I became a patient of the Arran centre over a year ago, I asked at my initial meeting with my psychiatrist about having a CPN, a service I has received for several years. This request was laughed off with the response ,what do you need a CPN for? I have great personal issues of trust with psychiatric services which is warranted and documented. I have made it clear that I do not like talking to lots of different people and when I was informed that if I had issues I was to call the duty nurse or crisis team. I made it very clear I was not comfortable with this care plan to which I was told, thats how we do it here. What part of that statement suggests your support your way.  \r\nCalling different people often strangers has been exceptionally difficult for me, making me feel vulnerable and afraid at times for my own safety. Psychiatrist appointments are not given in advance, when you speak with your psychiatrist you have no idea when your next appointment will be. I have also stated this does not sit well with me as I stay well by being extremely organised in my life. This to me is not organised as I cannot consider whether an issue can wait till my next appointment as I have no idea when it is.  \r\nRecently my mood has been very unstable precipitated by environmental factors. While my psychitrist has kindly contacted housing services, I have had little input from the centre except when I call. Due to the way I feel about cold calling and feeling the need to constantly explain and disclose information over and over I have decided that despite my current emotional state I can not and will not be making these cold calls again. I cannot cope with it. I don't trust anyone because I don't know anyone well enough. How do you divulge your darkest thoughts to a stranger and trust they will help you, you cant.  \r\nPlease let me add that the staff at the Arran centre are very kind, very caring and respectful but if you promote your support your way then please listen to what people say and don't just hear.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-03-04T21:52:36.43","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-03-06T11:05:31.287","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":11},{"name":"Yorkshire & Humber Patient Safety Research Collaboration","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1037820","id":"1037820"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1037820/responses","id":"1037820"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1037820/healthservices","id":"1037820"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1037820/tags","id":"1037820"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/g598h","id":"G598H","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/should%20listen","id":"Should listen"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/alone","id":"alone"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care%20plan","id":"care plan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/caring","id":"caring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/continuity%20of%20care","id":"continuity of care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/desperate","id":"desperate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/individual%20care","id":"individual care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kind%20staff","id":"kind staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/person-centred","id":"person-centred"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/respectful","id":"respectful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/understanding","id":"understanding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vulnerable","id":"vulnerable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/trust","id":"Trust"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20changes","id":"staff changes"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/comfortable","id":"comfortable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/telephone%20calls","id":"telephone calls"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1038774","id":"1038774"}]},{"id":1038080,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Friendly and helpful ","body":"Don't always get through to someone on the phone and have had issues with speaking to the reception staff before with being told there is no way to see a doctor or no appointment booked for me (even when it's been booked via 111) But the doctors are fantastic, they always respond promptly and appropriately to all e consults and this is definitely the best and easiest way to contact them- everything I've asked to be looked into and every suggestion I've made has been listened to- I'm very pleased with this doctors surgery at the moment because I can't express how helpful they have been.

How did I go from the safety of my own home to this scary place? Well, I was arrested and whilst I was de-arrested after a brief admission to a general hospital, I was immediately sectioned and literally carried kicking and screaming in the middle of the night into an ambulance to take me to Coombehaven.  \r\nThe regime here is harsh but ultimately fair even if it does not seem that way at the time. Why was I taken to seclusion for 3 days for hanging onto the telephone when speaking to my wife? Why was I offered a binary choice of tablets or a forced injection in the backside, which I regard as a metaphoric rape. I don't need answers to these rhetorical questions as I know my mind was disturbed. Ultimately the staff here are doing one of the toughest jobs in the world and I have realised that they have the patent's best interests at heart, even if it does not seem that way at the time. They are quite literally guardian angels.  \r\nI spent 3 weeks at Coombehaven. They were the toughest 3 weeks of my life. The first week, spent largely in solitary confinement, lost to my mind. Apparently I met my sister but I have literally no recollection of seeing her and couldn't recognise some of my notes from this period although I could see they were written in my own handwriting, albeit in the third person. The last 2 weeks were made much worse because I caught covid and hence had to spend a lot of time in my tiny room on my own.  \r\nUltimately I feel lucky because I have a loving family who support me and have been able to bring me home to continue my recovery. I recognise that most of the long term residents of the ward will not have this option. This is a desperate place where I found it very difficult to sleep even 2-3 hours a night. My sleep pattern remains disturbed and institutionalised to the point where I still wake at 0550 hours to get a shower and have breakfast because that was the way I escaped from my room in hospital.  \r\nUltimately Coombehavn is a place of safety for those for whom the alternative is somewhere extremely dark. It turned me around and so there is hope even amongst the chaos. Thank you to both shifts at Coombehaven for the under valued but simply extraordinary job you do.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-03-05T07:49:56.61","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-03-06T11:12:56.697","readBy":[{"name":"Devon Partnership NHS Trust","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1037829","id":"1037829"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1037829/responses","id":"1037829"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1037829/healthservices","id":"1037829"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1037829/tags","id":"1037829"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rwv_710i","id":"RWV_710i","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disturbed","id":"Disturbed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/family%20support","id":"family support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/food","id":"food"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good%20job","id":"good job"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lucky","id":"lucky"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/recovery","id":"recovery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/safety","id":"safety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/seclusion","id":"seclusion"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sectioned","id":"sectioned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported","id":"supported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/angels","id":"angels"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid","id":"covid"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1041169","id":"1041169"}]},{"id":1037347,"author":"Katetofu","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"I felt listened to and understood","body":"The doctor was very kind, I felt listened to and understood and I was pleased to leave with a plan in place.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-03-03T15:11:05.91","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-03-06T11:16:01.37","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":8}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1037347","id":"1037347"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1037347/responses","id":"1037347"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1037347/healthservices","id":"1037347"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1037347/tags","id":"1037347"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/new-victoria-hospital-derm","id":"new-victoria-hospital-derm","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/being%20listened%20to","id":"Being listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dermatology","id":"dermatology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctor","id":"doctor"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kind","id":"kind"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment%20plan","id":"treatment plan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/understood","id":"understood"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1038118","id":"1038118"}]},{"id":1037628,"author":"Harry23","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Mental Health Care Service -
