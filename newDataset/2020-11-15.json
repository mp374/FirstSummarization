I had to point out that I had problems with constrast and that usually a special one had to be ordered . Would it be possible to check. I was spoken to quite rudely as if it was too much trouble and as if I had learning difficulties, I was wearing the sunflower lanyard which is intended to promote respect if you have a dissibility that's not immediately evident so informed that she would get the radiographer. 45 mins later one arrived clearly pulled out of her lunch. No body had recorded that I had reacted previously and there was a risk. She gave me the information leaflet . It said in large letters do not use with patients with severe asthma! No alternative was available, no dr, no crash cart, no epipens. I had the scan without the contrast but was then informed by my consultant I should have had the contrast! This is an issue the trust needs to address . Allergies are serious and appropriate measures need to be taken if a patient flags this. I have flagged this with PALs but nothing has been done. It's hampered my treatment and made me feel I'm wasting time.

Prior to the Stoke my Mother was proud, fiercely independent and in good health for her age. She is an amazing individual, worked all her life, a great Mum and wife. Sadly the Stoke took away her ability to ever walk again and brought on vascular dementia. My Mother's current wheelchair was becoming uncomfortable and she was able to spend shorter periods of time in this chair therefore was spending more time in bed. A referral for a new wheelchair was made by myself and her care home in September 2019, I was told at this time that there was a 9 month waiting list, just for a referral, which would take it up to summer 2020 however this was delayed again and so I called in September 2020 to be told due to coronaviras, there was a further delay of three months. However I recently received a call from Occupational Therapist who had been to see Mum, and who was extremely helpful, explaining that they had recommended the care home provide a static chair, also highlighted the need for Mum to receive an assessment for new wheelchair and gave several reasons why. I then called the SMART centre to chase up the assessment, I was told Mum is near the top of the list and it has been agreed a video assessment would take place soon. Today however I received a phone call from SMART centre to inform me that there is a backlog of 18 months? I had to check they had the correct person which was confirmed. I asked to speak with someone else, they said there was no point but would 'put a note on' for a specialist, I explained what my experience was, that I was told only recently that Mum would receive her long-awaited assessment and that this figure of 18 months seems to have come from nowhere. They replied it certainly had not, I felt I was getting nowhere so I called the occupational therapist and left a voicemail. My family are already going through so much, my Dad is also elderly and we have only managed to see Mum once since lockdown, we think of her constantly and want to know she is as comfortable as possible. Mum currently does not have a wheelchair which meets her needs, and no static chair though I understand this is not an issue for NHS, however \"whoever is responsible for what\" does not mean anything to my Mother, all that matters is she is being let down. I am sure the OT will call me, I was impressed by their professionalism and compassion however I feel the need to do something right now as I am not prepared to allow this to go on much longer and certainly not 18 months. It makes me so so sad and frustrated that someone who deserves so much more is given so little.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-11-11T20:04:52.8966667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-11-16T12:49:48.847","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lothian","count":9}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/802687","id":"802687"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/802687/responses","id":"802687"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/802687/healthservices","id":"802687"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/802687/tags","id":"802687"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/s201h_314","id":"S201H_314","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disgusted","id":"disgusted"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frustrated","id":"frustrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sad","id":"sad"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/consistency","id":"consistency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dementia","id":"dementia"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/elderly","id":"elderly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/occupational%20therapist","id":"occupational therapist"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professional","id":"professional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stroke","id":"stroke"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/uncomfortable","id":"uncomfortable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vascular%20dementia","id":"vascular dementia"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/walk","id":"walk"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wheelchair","id":"wheelchair"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassion","id":"compassion"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wait%20for%20assessment","id":"wait for assessment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/delays","id":"delays"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/804186","id":"804186"}]},{"id":802818,"author":"Coughy McWheezy","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"COVID-19 testing","body":"I recently attended for a Covid test at the Emirates arena.

I struggled a lot with depression, suicidal thoughts and anxiety. I am a very shy girl. The nurse I was speaking to would get very impatient with me. I once told them I was feeling suicidal at that moment, and they said that neither of us could leave until I say I'm fine. I felt that the notes were written to make it look like there was progress.  \r\nThere was also a psychiatrist that was completely rude and I felt was mocking me. Their words still hurt me to this day. I was to have an appointment to discuss medication as I was just going down hill. I noticed that the manners and body language used didn't seem caring or professional at all. I talked about my suicide attempts, which were happening around 2-3 times a week. At my description of one of my attempts, the staff member was extremely dismissive and rolled their eyes. Then told me that I must not have wanted to do it if I ended up phoning someone for help, which I felt was hinting that I was doing it for attention. About the medication, said that no medication will stop you from doing what I had done, referring to the suicide attempt that had not been taken seriously. I already knew anti-depressants didn't work that way, which I kept saying.  \r\nA while later, I had attempted again and ended up in the A&E, when the nurse was reading my notes from CAMHS, it had said I had been seeking attention, this is the last thing I wanted people to think about me. I had started to believe these things and felt guilty asking for help.  \r\nA while after turning 18, I started with adult mental health services. There is such a huge difference to the level of care provided here. They were fantastic with me and I actually felt listened to.  \r\nFrom noticing this big difference and have experienced what I did at CAMHS, I am now studying to become a nurse. I just hope that the staff from CAMHS realise why they are here and re-evaluate their work ethics. You should never treat someone that way, especially people who feel vulnerable.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-11-15T19:00:46.91","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-11-16T13:16:57.267","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Education for Scotland","count":1},{"name":"NHS Lanarkshire","count":8},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":1},{"name":"Scottish Recovery Network","count":1},{"name":"North Lanarkshire Health & Social Care Partnership","count":1},{"name":"Ulster University, MBBS (Medicine) 2021","count":1},{"name":"See Me","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/803562","id":"803562"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/803562/responses","id":"803562"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/803562/healthservices","id":"803562"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/803562/tags","id":"803562"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l103h_710","id":"L103H_710","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20listened%20to","id":"not listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/adult%20mental%20health","id":"adult mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/camhs","id":"camhs"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/depression","id":"depression"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dismissive","id":"dismissive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20taken%20seriously","id":"not taken seriously"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attitude","id":"staff attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/suicide","id":"suicide"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/body%20language","id":"body language"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/803673","id":"803673"}]},{"id":803434,"author":"Spiridoula","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"My experience in assessment unit","body":"I was taken by ambulance to Ayr Hospital. The paramedics were exemplary. When I arrived I was seen straight away by nurses who were also exemplary. Up until now all of these caring professionals were kind, helpful and reassuring.  \r\nI was taken to A and E and was told I would be moved when a bed became available. There were no beds available so I stayed in A and E all night long. I was there for over 12 hours. It was a dreadful night and I didn't sleep at all so was exhausted by morning. This was not the fault of any member of staff there, just circumstance. A doctor saw me at 2am. They confirmed, as had everyone throughout the entire process, that there was an anomaly in my ECGs that indicated a possible previous/recent heart attack. The doctor said that I needed to see a cardiologist who would both scan the heart and perform a stress test. A cardiologist would also assess any relevant medication. They listened to my symptoms, not just the current ones, but everything that had led me to this point.Early in the morning I was moved to Assessment, and stayed there without any communication until around 12.30 when a doctor came in to the cubicle. At around 11 I had asked a passing nurse for some information. I was shown some notes explaining that I was to be referred as an out patient for a heart scan and a treadmill test and that I would receive medication, including something to reduce cholesterol before being discharged.When the doctor came in, it was clear they had not read my notes, knew nothing about my case, was not aware that I had been there all night as he thought I had just arrived. Wouldn't let me speak, told me they weren't interested in family history as regards heart disease, or anything else. Didn't know my cholesterol levels when I managed to ask. I felt this doctor was rude, aggressive, belligerent and dismissive. This made me feel guilty for being there. This staff member was in the cubicle for less than a minute, during which time, contradicted everything their colleagues had said. I asked about the heart scan that had been mentioned. They replied that it was them who would make that decision, and that they were not interested in anyone else's opinion. I was told that there was nothing wrong with me, to get dressed and go. I left feeling emotionally assaulted, very worried, confused and extremely upset. Given that at least 5 medical professionals had told me that there was a risk that I had already had a heart attack, after everything I'd been through, not just at the hospital but with my health generally I felt borderline suicidal when I left the unit.I asked the name of the doctor and was reluctantly given a name. I enquired whether this person was a cardiologist and was told that they were not. Whoever this person was, the experience completely destroyed me. Even if they were indeed correct and every single one of their colleagues wrong, the manner of this staff member is possibly the worst I've ever encountered. I felt that they dismissed me, and the opinion of colleagues and other hospital staff, as being lesser.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-11-14T15:18:01.5566667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-11-16T13:18:08.103","readBy":[{"name":"Scottish Ambulance Service","count":11},{"name":"NHS Ayrshire & Arran","count":16},{"name":"Office of Colin Smyth, MSP for South Scotland","count":1},{"name":"St. Andrews University ScotGEM Medical Students","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/803434","id":"803434"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/803434/responses","id":"803434"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/803434/healthservices","id":"803434"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/803434/tags","id":"803434"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/a210h_180","id":"A210H_180","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/a210h-cau","id":"a210h-cau","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/scot-ambulance-emergency","id":"scot-ambulance-emergency","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/aggressive","id":"aggressive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confused","id":"confused"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20being%20listened%20to","id":"not being listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20listened%20to","id":"not listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stress","id":"stress"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/worried","id":"worried"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/a&e%20staff","id":"A&E staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/arrogant","id":"arrogant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bed%20availability","id":"bed availability"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cholesterol","id":"cholesterol"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dismissed","id":"dismissed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dismissive","id":"dismissive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctor","id":"doctor"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/exhausted","id":"exhausted"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/heart","id":"heart"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/heart%20attack","id":"heart attack"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/initial%20care","id":"initial care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/insensitive","id":"insensitive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/paramedics","id":"paramedics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scan","id":"scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/test","id":"test"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20manner","id":"staff manner"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dreadful","id":"dreadful"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/804185","id":"804185"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/804209","id":"804209"}]},{"id":802854,"author":"Scottie2020","authorRoleId":3,"authorRole":"a parent/guardian","title":"My father's care","body":"My father attended Jubilee Cardiology day unit for angiogram. Due to extent of damage, he was admitted late on Friday to 2East. He was then moved on the Saturday to 2C to a room with no shower facility and a frosted window. There appears to have been multiple discussions with Clinicians regarding heart damage and intervention. Father had many Doctors visit him discuss their views and then another doctor would have differing views, each time being advised he would be discussed at MDT next day. On Monday am he was given a gown and mentally prepared himself for the lab, however then another Doctor advised they were still unsure of best action and a Senior needed to review him. Further 2 Surgeons then visited the following day to rule out a bypass due to risks. Therefore Dad was prepared again on the Wednesday morning for the lab and sat another full day waiting until confirmed by 7pm he would not be taken, the impact of the growth of anxiety and then the disappointment is detrimental to overall health.  \r\nMeanwhile, throughout this time, no visitors are allowed, therefore Dad has sat confined to room for 7 days now, with nil purposeful activity being offered to improve mental & physical wellbeing. I have listened on the telephone to my Father on a daily basis deteriorating in mood, motivation, function and skills. Given how overwhelmed he has felt, the increasing anxiety regarding the news and the indecisiveness regarding the intervention, it is extremely disappointing that Father has waited so long for intervention, and that no alternative social supports can be offered to him, not even PT securing some exercises to his bedroom wall to give him some purpose whilst he waits within the room.  \r\nI am deeply saddened to witness the deterioration in Fathers mental wellbeing due to unnecessary delays, poor communication amongst staff and also with family, not to mention the Covid risks waiting such length of time in hospital for a procedure. Hospital staff need to appreciate the vast impact on patients currently within hospitals with no family support and no-one to advocate when medical information is overwhelming.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-11-12T12:28:12.9533333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-11-16T13:20:52.563","readBy":[{"name":"Office of Colin Smyth, MSP for South Scotland","count":1},{"name":"Scottish Government","count":2},{"name":"Golden Jubilee National Hospital","count":2},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2022)","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/802854","id":"802854"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/802854/responses","id":"802854"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/802854/healthservices","id":"802854"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/802854/tags","id":"802854"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/d102h-interventional-cardiology","id":"D102H-interventional-cardiology","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frustrated","id":"frustrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helpless","id":"helpless"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/angiogram","id":"Angiogram"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cardiology","id":"cardiology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/facilities","id":"facilities"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/family%20involvement","id":"Family involvement"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/heart","id":"heart"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nursing%20care","id":"nursing care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/saddened","id":"Saddened"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/visiting","id":"visiting"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/delays","id":"delays"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/video%20consultation","id":"video consultation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/family%20advocacy","id":"family advocacy"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/804284","id":"804284"}]},{"id":802923,"author":"Successful","authorRoleId":11,"authorRole":"other","title":"Recovery","body":"I was supported for 5 months by the Orion unit in Bullwell Nottingham to get better.

Lovely birthday party. Did not like when staff were falling out and going to take me out and then being told by another staff member you can not take her out she is on my observation. Since being home things have gone from strength to strength, extra support from reach care and attended day centre full dayâ€™s 4 days a week.

I am showering and washing my own hair I am doing small shops on my own and weekly shops with reach care staff on a Thursday my day off reach. And washing laundry. Try to cook own tea and make my own breakfast and pack up. I catch up with church on youtube for service and zoom chat afterwards. I keep in contact with friends. I am learning to get used to signing still and taking my own tablets. Helps to have a small read about autism spectrum which I did not know I had with the learning disability.

It was Friday night and the leg had been painful in the early evening but at my age I thought nothing about it until I examined my leg later in the evening. On seeing my leg my wife was quite alarmed and had me drive with her to A&E.  \r\nAt A&E I had to wait a little while till I was seen and assessed by a nurse. She advised me that it could take some time to be seen. I informed her that because of the Covid 19 situation my wife was not admitted to the hospital and that she was in the car outside. The nurse suggested that if she took a blood sample for examination then I could take my wife home and return for further treatment. This was done.  \r\nOn return I was examined several times and advised to stay in hospital overnight. I spent a quiet night in a single room. In the morning it was found that a scan could not be carried out .It was decided to teach me how to inject myself then come back to hospital for more treatment the following Tuesday. This was done and the following Tuesday I returned for a scan and further examinations.  \r\nIn conclusion, the nursing and medical staff were very attentive, professional, dedicated, and friendly. I cannot remember their names but I will never forget them.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-11-13T15:47:47.5633333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-11-16T13:45:29.31","readBy":[{"name":"St. Andrews University ScotGEM Medical Students","count":1},{"name":"NHS Grampian","count":6}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/803071","id":"803071"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/803071/responses","id":"803071"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/803071/healthservices","id":"803071"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/803071/tags","id":"803071"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/n101h_180","id":"N101H_180","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/n101h-hospital-at-night","id":"N101H-hospital-at-night","score":5},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/n101h-radiology","id":"N101H-radiology","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/attentive","id":"attentive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood","id":"blood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dedicated","id":"dedicated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/in%20good%20hands","id":"in good hands"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professionalism","id":"professionalism"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scan","id":"scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/803963","id":"803963"}]},{"id":803662,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Friendly Practice ","body":"Every care was taken too protect all patients against COVID-19 . \nThe staff where firm but friendly on any advice given out.\n","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-11-12T14:44:56","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-11-16T14:09:40","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/803662","id":"803662"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/803662/responses","id":"803662"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/803662/healthservices","id":"803662"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/803662/tags","id":"803662"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/n84006","id":"N84006","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/804148","id":"804148"}]},{"id":803661,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Excellent care ","body":"I contacted the surgery at 8am on Friday morning with an urgent problem.

On the Monday morning he said his tongue still felt funny (no drooping of mouth and could move his tongue evenly to left & right side of cheek) but also said his eyesight did not feel quite right. We immediately called 999.  \r\nOn arrival of the ambulance they found his blood pressure very high. My husband was relatively fit and not overweight and was in good health and did not suffer from any underlying problems other than light asthma. He had not seen a doctor or had his blood pressure taken for about 8 years. He was rushed to hospital and over 4 days had MRI scans, CT scans, ultrasound and lumbar puncture taken but nothing abnormal was found. The first consultant he saw thought he had suffered from a TIA but the two subsequent consultants decided that it hadnâ€™t been a TIA and that his symptoms were a result of high blood pressure. He was released after 3 days. He was released with a blood pressure monitor to wear for 48 hours then when that was returned, a heart monitor for 24 hours. I believe neither of these recordings showed anything untoward. He attended our own medical surgery where he spoke to another doctor. He again complained of the odd feeling in his tongue but was told this could just be down to nerve damage. How I wish we had insisted he be readmitted!  \r\nA week later my husband suffered from a major stroke. He was rushed to hospital and medicated. Unfortunately swelling occurred at the site of stroke, causing pressure build up which we were told would be fatal without intervention. My husband was rushed to a neurological unit at QUEH where he underwent a craniotomy to the left side of his head. The large piece of skull removed from the left hand side of his head was placed in his abdomen for safe keeping. He survived. More than two months later he was allowed home where therapy continued. A further three months later he had further surgery to replace the piece of skull onto his head. He has now been allowed home.  \r\nDue to the stroke my husband now suffers from aphasia. He struggles with nouns and names particularly, he does not know the alphabet and cannot read or write. He does not always understand questions and often struggles to find words when asked direct questions. He has slight weakness in his right side and a lack of dexterity in his right hand. He has forgotten how to work tools and electrical items.  \r\nThere is no doubt that my husband received and continues to receive, on the most part, outstanding care during a time complicated by the Covid 19 situation but there are a few occasions where I feel we have been let down.  \r\n1. The very first consultant being overruled as to first diagnosis of a TIA.  \r\n2. The doctor at our local medical practice dismissing tongue paralysis as nerve damage.  \r\n3. After my husbands craniotomy no one phoned to let us know he was out of surgery or that it had gone ok. I phoned the ward at 2am to ask if he was out of theatre to discover that surgery finished over 3 hours earlier. A day and a half after surgery, I still hadnâ€™t been contacted by a medical practitioner & it took me to ask specifically for a doctor, registrar or consultant to phone me before that contact and update was made.  \r\n4. The same occurred whilst my husband recuperated in hospital. I had to request a doctor/consultant contact me with an update as to his condition. Nursing staff were fabulous but could only provide me with limited information and because of my husbands aphasia he could not remember and/or physically tell me anything the doctors had discussed with him.  \r\n5. When my husband had his skull replaced, first a nurse and then a doctor phoned me on the date of his admission as my husband was unable to answer their questions and they were unsure if he understood all that he was being told.  \r\nMy husband contacted me on his return to the ward after surgery. It is very disappointing that to date no medical practitioner has contacted me with an update as to how the surgery went. My husband was unable to ask them questions due to his slowness of speech and inability to find the right words of the subject matter and he is unable to tell me what information the consultant and registrars told him.  \r\nIf we were not dealing with Covid restrictions I would have frequently been visiting my husband and present for ward rounds where I could have listened and asked questions on his behalf.  \r\n6. A decision was made that my husband could go home at approximately 5pm on a Sunday. We stay approximately 1 hour from the hospital and it was after 6pm by arrived to pick him up. The main doors to neurology were locked and unattended. On phoning the ward they directed me to a back door and a nurse brought my husband down. The lighting outside was very poor and taking someone who has had major surgery down and up pavements and across roads in poorly lit conditions not ideal. The nurse could hardly read his discharge notes and medication.  \r\nBoth operations have gone well and my husband is working very hard to improve in all the areas in which he has been affected. He has had outstanding care from medical staff, nurses and therapists during very difficult circumstances this year. Where we feel greatly let down is on points one and two and then mostly the lack of communication, updates, information & advice from medical staff for points 3 -5.  \r\nPoint 6 just felt rushed and inappropriate & could/should have been better done.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-11-12T14:40:29.65","progress":"Story has a

On one occasion when I was concerned about my symptoms, Kirsty visited me with full PPE to check my vitals and observe my physical condition.  \r\nAs my diagnosis has recently undergone scrutiny, Kirsty has always been there to offer support and guidance, even during times when we haven't had appointments booked. Kirsty has also liaised on my behalf with my Hepatology Consultant.  \r\nI feel very confident with Kirsty, and feel like I can be up front and honest without any judgement from her. In my experience, this is a key attribute to a good working relationship and without her I believe my lifestyle changes would have been a far greater challenge to achieve.  \r\nI have worked with numerous health professionals in my life. I value Kirsty as an integral part of helping me with my health problems and (hopefully, someday) recovery; her experience and compassion are by far second to none.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-11-13T10:58:05.58","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-11-16T15:27:32.413","readBy":[{"name":"Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust","count":8}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/803038","id":"803038"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/803038/responses","id":"803038"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/803038/healthservices","id":"803038"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/803038/tags","id":"803038"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rha20-specialist-arltc","id":"rha20-specialist-arltc","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/alcohol","id":"alcohol"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/experience","id":"experience"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/knowledge","id":"knowledge"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/non%20judgemental","id":"non judgemental"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurse","id":"nurse"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nursing","id":"nursing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nursing%20home","id":"nursing home"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pancreatitis","id":"pancreatitis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/recovery","id":"recovery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attitude","id":"staff attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassion","id":"compassion"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confident","id":"confident"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/chronic%20pancreatitis","id":"chronic pancreatitis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ppe","id":"ppe"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/813153","id":"813153"}]},{"id":803043,"author":"mattie mae","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"laser treatment by optician","body":"I was treated by receptionists nurses and opticians a few weeks ago at Inverclyde out patient hospital I was received and treated with much kindness and understanding and the laser treatment was for me a miracle giving me back one eye weakened by posterior capsule opacification.

From my very first contact with my midwife I was advised that official contact would take place after 8 weeks as this is the timeframe in which women most commonly suffer a miscarriage. A time when women may need the most support of all is when they are left alone to experience a loss that is traumatic not only physically but emotionally and mentally, with little communication or information.  \r\nFollowing some bleeding at 9 weeks I was offered an early scan at the Early Pregnancy Assessment Unit. At this scan I was informed that my pregnancy had likely stopped growing but I would need to come back in 7 days to confirm. The midwife who spoke with me on this day was very professional however 3 key elements were missing for me - Care, Compassion and Communication. I left feeling very confused and felt the whole experience was very cold and impersonal. I therefore contacted my allocated midwife the following day who only upon receipt of my call checked the system and realised my situation. Again I found this very impersonal and if not for a phone call from me would I have had any contact from her? In fact, from this date I have never again heard from my midwife. I feel like I was only a number, and not a human being who was going through a traumatic experience. I've never received any results from blood tests, which I requested and the notes on my Maternity Notes App are sparse. These may have not given me any answers but I felt it was my right to know the outcome.  \r\nFollowing a second scan a week later, I was again left confused as it appeared that the pregnancy that had stopped growing at 6 weeks had infact grown in the 7 days since my last appointment meaning that I had to wait another 7 days for confirmation of miscarriage. During this scan, I would like to highlight that the midwife I dealt with was very empathetic, supportive and interested in my wellbeing and this made the world of difference to my experience and how I was feeling. She was very informative and if not for her input my whole experience would have been a negative one.  \r\nThe day after my second scan I began to experience severe cramping and bleeding and contacted the Early Pregnancy Assessment Unit for advice. During this conversation I was advised to take paracetamol and have a hot bath. I was also asked to take a pregnancy test the day prior to my next appointment and if this was negative to cancel my appointment. I was horrified by this and whilst the information was again delivered professionally, I found it cruel to ask a woman suffering a miscarriage to take a pregnancy test and to end care at that point should a pregnancy test be negative, taking into consideration the fact that nothing had been officially confirmed to me prior to this point and the only closure I would get would be from a further appointment.  \r\nAfter, I guess what you could call lucky, a further pregnancy test was positive, I attended my final scan appointment to which I was met by the same midwife again who was able to confirm my miscarriage and showed me the care, compassion and support that had been missing from most of my pregnancy experience. The only saving grace from my whole experience was the contact I had with this midwife and her ability to shine light at the end of a very dark tunnel.  \r\nOn the whole, I do not feel that I was appropriately supported throughout my pregnancy experience and feel this issue needs to be highlighted and a change of practice implemented so that women like myself are not made to feel pushed aside when their pregnancy is no longer viable. A miscarriage is a very lonely and harrowing experience which is only made worse with a lack of communication, information and support.  \r\nWhilst I appreciate the impact that Covid-19 has had on front line services and the pressures that comes with this, I don't feel this is an excuse for a lack of care, compassion and communication. These simple steps are all it took for me to feel better informed and more supported and the fact that it was not common practice in my experience makes me sad, especially for those women who may be going through what I have gone through. I can only hope that by sharing my experience, that someone else has a more positive experience that I did.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-11-13T15:15:08.4133333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-11-16T16:58:33.617","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lanarkshire","count":7},{"name":"Voluntary Action North Lanarkshire","count":1},{"name":"Scottish Government","count":1},{"name":"Ulster University, MBBS (Medicine) 2021","count":1},{"name":"Partnership for Change","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/803060","id":"803060"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/803060/responses","id":"803060"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/803060/healthservices","id":"803060"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/803060/tags","id":"803060"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l308h_501","id":"L308H_501","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sl9-community-maternity-airdrie","id":"SL9-Community-Maternity-Airdrie","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confused","id":"confused"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lack%20of%20care","id":"Lack of care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sad","id":"sad"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/alone","id":"alone"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/early%20pregnancy","id":"early pregnancy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/horrified","id":"horrified"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/information","id":"information"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/midwife","id":"midwife"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/miscarriage","id":"miscarriage"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pregnancy","id":"pregnancy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pregnancy%20loss","id":"pregnancy loss"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassion","id":"compassion"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/empathetic","id":"empathetic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/one%20staff%20member","id":"one staff member"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/804297","id":"804297"}]},{"id":803161,"author":"Snail","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Problems with my only foot","body":"Came to A&amp; E from Bury as I was having problems with my only foot as I lost the other due to circulation problems and Oldham has a vascular unit.
