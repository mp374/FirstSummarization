She clearly new her job and did it with expertise and a sense of humour making me feel at ease and looked after. Several people came to see me all who treated me with compassion and professionalism. From the Junior plastic surgeon who explained everything meticulously, to the reassuring anaesthetist who gave me onfidence and put me at ease. What amazing people YOU are. From the moment I lay down in the operating theatre I felt relaxed thanks to YOUR efforts. I was cold and you gave me warm blankets, you reassured me everything was fine. I would just like to say thank you to the team who looked after me. You work in a very difficult and stressful environment and I think sometimes people forget that your only human. People forget the long hours you have to endure day in day out.

I felt this was so rude and completely unacceptable to not treat the pain I was expressing, which I thought was something that was taught to nurses that pain is susceptible and different between people and to treat the pain as expressed by a patient not how they perceive it.  \r\nOn discharge I was told I would be contacted every 2-3 days, and if I had any issues I had two points of contact to reach out to.

Unfortunately it’s not today. I’m registered to use the patient access online booking system. However if you have a future appointment the system will not let you book an appointment unless you cancel the existing appointment. So if you have an appointment for a routine blood test (or anything) a whole month away you cannot use the system to make an advance appointment to see a doctor. So you have to telephone. This morning I dialled at precisely 08.00 to get a busy signal. I then over the next 20 minutes dialled a further 53 times. The phone was answered shortly after 08.20 on my 54th attempt. You are then in a queue. I waited on hold for a further 11 minutes before my call was answered. I have got an appointment in three weeks time which is not ideal. This is what the website on Monday 02 March 2020 states about routine advance appointments “We have more routine appointments available up to two weeks in advance.” I think that statement should now read three weeks in advance to be more accurate.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-03-02T09:15:05","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2020-03-02T09:47:07","readBy":[{"name":"Healthwatch Tameside","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/746075","id":"746075"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/746075/responses","id":"746075"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/746075/healthservices","id":"746075"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/746075/tags","id":"746075"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/p89003","id":"P89003","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood","id":"blood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20test","id":"blood test"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hope","id":"Hope"}]},{"id":746080,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Really good practice ","body":"I’ve been a patient here for some years and have always thought that Ritchie Group is really good.

The appointment got cancelled due to the nurse been ill and then she was off for 2 weeks annual leave, (this can’t be helped and everyone needs a holiday.) The receptionist booked an appointment for myself on the Saturday at a Hanley surgery which is completely unacceptable as I live around the corner from Foden Street Surgery Stoke. Then trying to book another appointment was a nightmare. When I am with the nurse and she books my next appointment it is always at the same time 4.30/4.45 the receptionist was unable to book this time as only the nurse could book this timeslot. So the next appointment that was available was 09/03 at 3.45pm but she would speak to the nurse to see if I can get an appointment for 4.30/4.45pm, I rang on 02/03 at 8.30am only to be told that those timeslots have been taken whilst the nurse was on annual leave. When an appointment has been cancelled by yourselves then this should be taken as priority as it was cancelled at no fault of my own. Also when the nurse is on annual leave get cover as this would be the most logical solution. Over the last couple of years this practice has gone down bank, there used to be four doctors and 2 nurses now there is only one full time doctor and one nurse, this is not a great experience at all. I would move doctors but Trent Vale is not much better as I moved from there to Foden Street.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-03-02T08:56:42","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-03-02T09:50:57","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/746079","id":"746079"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/746079/responses","id":"746079"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/746079/healthservices","id":"746079"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/746079/tags","id":"746079"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/m83134","id":"M83134","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helped","id":"helped"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/747292","id":"747292"}]},{"id":746078,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"0 Appointments","body":"Just trying to book a smear test.

However, about 4 days after coming home my baby just would not latch, we were both crying and stressing. To top it off the midwife had just informed me the baby would have to go back up to hospital as her jaundice would need treatment. How was I going to get to hospital (30mins away) when my baby hadn't even had a proper feed all morning? Queue more stress and crying. I had already met Lana, our feeding support worker as she had come to visit us during our pregnancy to answer all the questions I had about breastfeeding. She was so friendly and made sure I knew she was there for support whenever required. So I gave her a ring. She assured me all would be fine and she was popping into to see us before the hospital appointment. When she arrived she put me right at ease, we had a talk about what was going on and how we might improve the latch. I then tried to feed with these tips and voilà my hungry baby was back on feeding like a trooper. Lana stayed till the feed was done and I was confident that we were back on track with feeding. The baby slept the entire journey back to hospital. I have no doubt that journey would have gone down like a lead balloon had Lana not taken the time to come support me before hand.  \r\nFurther down the line (6-8weeks old) our little one developed really bad gas that she struggled to pass. This made her feeding patterns change dramatically and I worried that her latch was maybe cause some extra wind. Again, I was able just to give Lana a quick text and she arranged to come for a visit. She put me at ease about baby gas, checked out our latch, checked tongue tie then gave me some really useful info about baby massage, colic hold and use of a sling to ease my babies discomfort. By the time she had left I felt confident again that I had more tools to help my baby get back to her usual self.  \r\nBeing able to see a feeding support worker on a weekly basis has been a godsend on my feeding journey. Just a week or so ago (4months old) I noticed my baby was just not getting as much milk as she needed/wanted at nights. I was able to just have a quick chat with Lana, who again was so knowledgeable about helping keep up with my babies demands. Giving me techniques to improve the supply and ensuring me that my body will meet my babies new demands after a short transition.  \r\nI had always intended to breastfeed my baby for the health benefits for us both. I never envisioned how difficult something so 'natural' could be and if it wasn't for the feeding support workers (Lana in my case) there is no way that I'd still be breastfeeding by almost 5month old.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-03-01T15:38:28.6266667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-03-02T11:49:23.313","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Highland","count":3},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/746018","id":"746018"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/746018/responses","id":"746018"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/746018/healthservices","id":"746018"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/746018/tags","id":"746018"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/h202h_501","id":"H202H_501","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/baby%20massage","id":"baby massage"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/colic","id":"colic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/jaundice","id":"jaundice"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/knowledgeable","id":"knowledgeable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/massage","id":"massage"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pregnancy","id":"pregnancy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/specialist","id":"specialist"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support%20with%20feeding","id":"support with feeding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/techniques","id":"techniques"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confident","id":"confident"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20ease","id":"at ease"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/747453","id":"747453"}]},{"id":746118,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Registration","body":"Spent some effort to come to GP using crutches due to leg injury just to be turned away as they do not accept paperwork for new patients on Mondays and also are unable to make a copy of ID and receptionist requested to bring a copy next time, last thing i want to do whilst injured.

My baby is now on formula as I was too nervous to continue trying breastfeeding (although milk did come through a few days later) as on formula I now know my baby is definitely feeding well. &nbsp;","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-03-01T21:59:38.7766667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-03-02T11:51:47.64","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Highland","count":3},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/746035","id":"746035"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/746035/responses","id":"746035"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/746035/healthservices","id":"746035"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/746035/tags","id":"746035"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/h202h_501","id":"H202H_501","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helpless","id":"helpless"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nervous","id":"nervous"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/information","id":"information"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/jaundice","id":"jaundice"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/weight","id":"weight"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/more%20checks","id":"more checks"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/747448","id":"747448"}]},{"id":746030,"author":"M17","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Colonoscopy and Gastroscopy","body":"Excellent care and service from all staff who made me feel relaxed and well informed. &nbsp; &nbsp;","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-03-01T20:50:45.7533333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-03-02T11:52:31.513","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Fife","count":5},{"name":"Fife Health & Social Care Partnership","count":1},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/746030","id":"746030"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/746030/responses","id":"746030"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/746030/healthservices","id":"746030"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/746030/tags","id":"746030"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/f805h-endoscopy","id":"F805H-endoscopy","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/colonoscopy","id":"colonoscopy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gastroscopy","id":"gastroscopy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kept%20informed","id":"kept informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/relaxed","id":"relaxed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/service","id":"service"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/746121","id":"746121"}]},{"id":746120,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Brilliant service","body":"I was in for a suspect lump to be removed, I would like to say from the booking to procedure being done to checking out this department was first class, the put my mind at rest all the way from start to finish.

Our experience, as with our first child, was fantastic so this is a shout out to the fantastic team they have there. Our first child was born after a very long labour with the baby in a “back to back” position which meant a huge amount of pain for my wife. The team dealt with the situation very professionally and an epidural was decided upon once it became clear that the labour was taking too much out of my wife / the pain was getting too severe. This allowed her to get some rest and meant that when the time came, she managed to push our son out quickly. The aftercare my wife received both immediately after giving birth and then the assistance which she received in getting established with breastfeeding and general first time mum stuff was brilliant.  \r\nOur second child was slightly more straightforward (no epidural this time but an induction due to early waters breaking but labour not onset) but nevertheless the care we received was just brilliant. One of the things we like about the BGH is that there is a familiarity there that made us feel incredibly at ease (Joan , who looked after my wife before and during labour this time round , looked after her post labour last time, and so on). I think this says great things about the department as they clearly have a great base of loyal , committed staff.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-03-01T20:43:13.9","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-03-02T12:30:38.51","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Borders","count":4},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/746028","id":"746028"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/746028/responses","id":"746028"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/746028/healthservices","id":"746028"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/746028/tags","id":"746028"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/b120h_501","id":"B120H_501","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/aftercare","id":"aftercare"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/birth","id":"birth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/continuity%20of%20care","id":"continuity of care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/epidural","id":"epidural"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/giving%20birth","id":"giving birth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/induction","id":"induction"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/labour","id":"labour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/long%20labour","id":"long labour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/person-centred","id":"person-centred"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professional","id":"professional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20ease","id":"at ease"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fantastic%20team","id":"fantastic team"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/746151","id":"746151"}]},{"id":746137,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"New appointment system isn't working","body":"From January, patients are only able to access a doctor via telephone/online appointments daily from 8am. Same day, 10 minute slots are available to book a doctor to call you back. In my experience, it is impossible to log in online around 8am as so many people are trying to do the same, similarly on the phone, ( I was number 14 in the queue at 8.10 this morning..) If you book online, there is no access to your own doctor, appointment allocation is random.\nThis first come first served system is deeply floored, particularly in relation to emergency access. It is time consuming and stressful to be struggling with this process in the morning and I'm sure for some patients, it is impossible to do due to work/child care etc.,\nIn January, I was told by a receptionist that a doctor would call me \"late afternoon\"the same day but I would get a text message to give more details later, (which I never received). I missed the call as I was unable to receive calls at the time it was made and was berated by the receptionist for not answering! \nI appreciate changes had to be made. (I have stood outside the surgery from 7.30-8am many times in order to make a same day appointment, which is clearly not ideal).\nI sincerely hope this is a trial and will be reviewed soon. Surely there has to be some way of discriminating between  patients that need same day access and those that don't. I also think there should still be some provision for patients being able to walk into the surgery and make an appointment, particularly when it's not urgent.\nI would like to add that apart from this organisational issue, I am totally satisfied with the medical provision at the surgery. I have been registered there for almost 20 years and have been happy with the services provided during this time.\n","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-03-02T09:13:26","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-03-02T12:54:53","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/746137","id":"746137"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/746137/responses","id":"746137"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/746137/healthservices","id":"746137"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/746137/tags","id":"746137"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/f84010","id":"F84010","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency","id":"emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20satisfied","id":"very satisfied"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happy","id":"happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hope","id":"Hope"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/satisfied","id":"satisfied"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/808587","id":"808587"}]},{"id":745783,"author":"Cloudless","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"I would have liked some written information","body":"The audiologist I saw was very pleasant and knowledgeable.
