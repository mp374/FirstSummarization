I was told countless times that I’d get an update later in the day from a doctor. When I asked a nurse later why I hadn’t seen the doctor I was told they were too busy. The two weekends I was in led to inaction due to the specialist doctors I needed to see not working. I was confidently given information by other doctors which contradicted information I had already received. I was later told by specialists that the general doctors who had advised me at the weekends were wrong. One doctor tried to discharge me home on a Saturday which I had to be very assertive about to prevent what I was later told would have been a very dangerous discharge.  \r\nThe person next to me with advance dementia was who was objecting to treatment was told by the nurse he had an MCA so they were acting in his best interest. It beggars belief that if this person lacks capacity they he would understand what that meant. We were frequently kept awake by staff talking loudly and laughing overnight, banging things around and seemingly having no regard for the need for sleep.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-08-23T05:50:50.9533333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-08-25T09:28:38.94","readBy":[{"name":"Royal Devon University Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust","count":8}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/872658","id":"872658"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/872658/responses","id":"872658"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/872658/healthservices","id":"872658"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/872658/tags","id":"872658"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rbz12_300","id":"RBZ12_300","score":2},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lack%20of%20sleep","id":"lack of sleep"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/understaffed","id":"understaffed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/noisy%20ward","id":"noisy ward"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/conflicting%20information","id":"conflicting information"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/873599","id":"873599"}]},{"id":872661,"author":"Ayrshire Resident2","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Disjointed care with no follow up - cardiac care","body":"I was diagnosed in February this year with Atrial Fibrillation and the GP referred me to see a cardiologist. My condition worsened and I was admitted to hospital as an emergency before my appointment with a cardiologist.  \r\nI was in hospital for 6 days, and was treated very well, as they increased my medication to try and control my heart rhythm. I was then given an Echo Cardiogram and released the same day.  \r\nI spoke to a doctor before my release who explained that my AF would be controlled by medication and I would be discharged to the care of the heart failure liaison nurse in the community who would adjust my medication as required. This was also repeated in my discharge letter.  \r\nThis never happened and I have spent the last 6 months trying to find out who should be monitoring my medication and condition.  \r\nI can provide details of the contact I have had with the consultant’s secretary, GP Practice and heart failure liaison nurse.  \r\nI don’t raise this issue with you lightly as I am aware of the pressure the NHS has been under during the pandemic, but I feel the follow up care I have received falls below an acceptable standard and should be evaluated to see if there are improvements to be made.

Upon speaking to a nurse at my GP's, they notified me that if they printed my prescription I would be able to pick it up from the practice rather than wait for it to be sent to the pharmacy as it would take longer.  \r\nAs I was in pain I said that would be great and so made my way to pick it up. I’m aware of covid restrictions and that the GP Practice has to take the safety of everyone seriously, however when I arrived I was spoken to in a rude manner and told I should not have just ‘turned up’ and that all prescriptions should be picked up from the pharmacy. The way in which I was spoken to really upset me and even when the nurse explained the situation to the receptionist I wasn’t offered an apology.  \r\nThe prescription wasn’t ready and so I was told to come back and so later I made my way back to the doctors. A different receptionist was now on and clearly there had been no communication between them as once again I was spoken to in a rude manner despite my prescription ready and waiting next to them. Again, no apology was offered when they realised and so I went home and cried. The last thing anyone needs when they’re in pain is to be spoken to like that twice despite being told to attend the surgery by a member of staff in the first place. I’m understanding of the current covid situation and the stress that everyone is currently experiencing. However, kindness goes a long way especially when communicating with unwell patients.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-08-23T09:10:42.9933333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-08-25T10:13:51.913","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Grampian","count":5},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2022)","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/872673","id":"872673"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/872673/responses","id":"872673"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/872673/healthservices","id":"872673"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/872673/tags","id":"872673"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sn9-gp","id":"sn9-gp","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stress","id":"stress"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/attitude","id":"attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pharmacy","id":"Pharmacy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/prescription","id":"Prescription"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/receptionists","id":"receptionists"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/spoken%20over","id":"spoken over"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid","id":"covid"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%2019","id":"covid 19"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/873770","id":"873770"}]},{"id":872675,"author":"mineralmh88","authorRoleId":4,"authorRole":"a relative","title":"My 91 year old mother was admitted to hospital","body":"There was no visiting allowed and my mother was not able to operate a mobile phone so we had no contact with her.

The staff were brilliant and caring and I made a very quick recovery. Initially I was scheduled to have this procedure done under local anaesthetic but having experienced a very painful biopsy (with no pain relief) which left me fearful, I insisted on having it done under general anaesthetic. Every woman who needs a hysteroscopy should have the opportunity to discuss pain relief options with her consultant and not be steered or pressured towards local anaesthetic as though it were her only choice. Here’s hoping that an individualised discussion about pain relief for this procedure can become standard, it might save a lot of unecessary distress. Thanks again to the consultant who treated me and all the team at Llandough for your care.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-08-23T12:16:37.91","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-08-25T10:47:07.783","readBy":[{"name":"Cardiff and Vale University Health Board","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/872712","id":"872712"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/872712/responses","id":"872712"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/872712/healthservices","id":"872712"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/872712/tags","id":"872712"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/7a4bv_502","id":"7A4BV_502","score":3},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anaesthetic","id":"Anaesthetic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/biopsy","id":"biopsy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/brilliant","id":"brilliant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/discussion","id":"discussion"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fearful","id":"fearful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hysteroscopy","id":"hysteroscopy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain%20relief","id":"pain relief"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thanks","id":"thanks"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/873389","id":"873389"}]},{"id":872740,"author":"Chafs65","authorRoleId":8,"authorRole":"a staff member posting for a patient/service user","title":"I could not be happier with the service","body":"I came in recently to be induced.

My therapist quickly put me at ease and was easy to talk to. \n\nAs I was still really struggling I was referred for a short course of CBT. Thereafter I was offered more intensive CBT by video. This therapist was professional, non-judgemental and it felt like they could handle my distress remaining empathic but without any significant reaction. We worked through strategies to manage my symptoms (attention exercises, rumination, activity diaries etc) and they listened at all times despite me going off track and drifting back into wanting to be counselled. The therapy did give me a greater sense of what I can control and a better understanding of my condition (anxiety as opposed to depression - although this is my self-diagnosis as the service is not diagnostic)\n\nMy only negative would be to say that 6 weeks is a very short period of time for counselling and I could have done with something more intensive. This is not the fault of the service and is an issuer relating to government funding. The practice did all they could to help and offer additional support, giving me three different courses of therapy as outlined above & I feel in a better position than when I started therapy ","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2021-08-20T07:53:17","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-08-25T12:23:09","readBy":[{"name":"South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/873366","id":"873366"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/873366/responses","id":"873366"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/873366/healthservices","id":"873366"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/873366/tags","id":"873366"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rv5cj","id":"RV5CJ","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20listened%20to","id":"not listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cbt","id":"cbt"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/counselling","id":"counselling"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/depression","id":"depression"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diagnosis","id":"diagnosis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/in%20control","id":"in control"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/feel%20better","id":"feel better"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/rumination","id":"rumination"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20ease","id":"at ease"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/922041","id":"922041"}]},{"id":872739,"author":"Chafs65","authorRoleId":8,"authorRole":"a staff member posting for a patient/service user","title":"My experience has been fine","body":"I came in through A&E, nurses were busy non-stop but I didn’t have to wait long.

Starting in the Emergency Department, I had a fairly long wait - approximately 7 hours. However, I couldn't fault the attentive and brilliant staff who looked after me during my time in the ED.  \r\nUp on the female surgical ward, my experience has been brilliant. The staff have been absolutely lovely - there really is no other word for them. They are just so very helpful and extremely attentive. I would especially like to mention nurses Jodie, Ursula and Katrina and the countless others involved in my care.  \r\nWhen it comes to the ward itself - I really could not fault the cleanliness. The staff are absolutely meticulous in keeping the ward in such a great way.  \r\nThe only real problem I have encountered during both of my stays is the food. The meals are absolutely atrocious. The quality of the food is alright but the repetitiveness is awful - especially if you are in for over a week. I have had to have food brought into me it has been that bad. Even if just the flavours of soup could be changed each week it would make it slightly better. When you are in hospital, mealtime can be the highlight of your day, which is why I am so disappointed.  \r\nAnother small point would be the quality of TV's in the wards. I feel a better quality TV's would be good as currently you can barely see them and the remote controls go missing half of the time. I feel that this would make a good difference to the monotony of the hospital stay.  \r\nA final point which does not affect me directly is the Virtual Visiting Service. I feel that it needs to be highlighted more to patients and their relatives. I have seen the amazing difference it can make to a person in hospital to see a friendly face, especially to those who are more elderly and lack their own access to technology. I feel that this service needs to be advertised more in order to improve the quality of the hospital stay for lots of people as it is clear that many are not aware of the service.","criticality":"minimally critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-08-24T19:24:14.9833333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-08-25T13:40:55.853","readBy":[{"name":"Southern Health and Social Care Trust","count":4}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/873133","id":"873133"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/873133/responses","id":"873133"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/873133/healthservices","id":"873133"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/873133/tags","id":"873133"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_33020_502","id":"ZT003_33020_502","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctors","id":"doctors"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/food","id":"food"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gall%20stones","id":"gall stones"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good","id":"good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/looked%20after","id":"looked after"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/television","id":"television"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ward%20tvs","id":"Ward tvs"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/food%20choices","id":"food choices"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/virtual%20visiting","id":"virtual visiting"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/promote%20virtual%20visiting","id":"promote virtual visiting"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/875718","id":"875718"}]},{"id":873082,"author":"juliethf57","authorRoleId":1,"authorRole":"a carer","title":"Support from stroke team","body":"Margaret (speech therapist) rang me a month ago to talk to me about her session with my uncle.

I can only say treatment has been hit & miss. Mostly I have been treated well. I have been dismissed by the department on several occasions only to have to return on a later date to get help I need. Last July I went on with severe stomach pain, loose bowls & loosing blood clots, to be told I just had a bout of 'enteritis' by the nurse & not to be so 'dramatic' & that I couldn't be in that much pain & sent home, only to be admitted again a couple of days later where the staffs attitude was total different, it was found I had an infection in my womb for which I needed antibiotics & was properly cared for.  \r\nOver the past couple of years my osteoarthritis is getting worse, I am constantly in one pain or another,which I can cope with most of the time, though when my joints go into 'spasm' the pain can get unbearable & also triggers my Anxiety(for which I am having CBT treatment to help me cope) My balance is off so regularly stumble, which I did last week resulting in me landing on my knee which caused a shooting pain in my hip when I tried to put weight on it, plus everytime I coughed, sneezed or nodded my head I got pain in my hip. I was taken to A&E where I was treated quite quickly. I was initially offered painkillers, which I did tell them I can't tolerate opiate base painkillers(I had been in hospital just a few weeks before due to a bad reaction to painkillers) Plus due to my Kidney problem I can't take anti-inflameties for which I was given a red/warning wrist band. I was sent for an x-ray which showed my replacement was fine & nothing was broken. (Which I was glad about) they then told me I could go home, (even though I told them I had no one at home & no way to get home) They were totally unconcerned about my other symptoms & just offered me various painkillers which I had already numerous times told them I can't take. By this time my Anxiety levels where excellerating as I felt I wasn't being listened to as the doctor said if I was refusing treatment to go! I was getting extremely upset as I wasn't refusing treatment I just couldn't take what they were offering. I was extremely upset by this time & just wanted to go home. I attempted to leave only to end up on the floor. A nurse did come upto me when I fell on the floor. I was confused & begging for help when another nurse came over & told me to get off the floor or they were getting the police! I was getting extremely upset & begging for help or just to let me go. I felt scared as the nurse was telling me to get off the floor & I was telling them I couldn't but they refused to help me & to 'turn it down'. I eventually got to my feet & left the department having a full blown panic attack not knowing what to do or where I was going. A lady(a member of the public) outside tried to ring me a taxi but couldn't get through. I managed to make my way round to main reception & taxi rank to find that taxis where actually on strike that evening.  \r\nI don't know how long I was wandering around for but I eventually got to the main road where I was spotted by my son's friend who happened to be passing. He picked me up & brought me home. He rang the hospital to find out why I was left wondering around in that state. They told him I had refused treatment & was aggressive, he told them he couldn't believe that as I am not an aggressive person to which they told him they had it all on film & to complain if we want.  \r\nNot only am I still suffering with pain & numbs but also extreme anxiety & no idea how to get help now theses people have flagged me as 'aggressive'","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-08-22T22:10:22.9266667","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2021-08-25T15:08:16.817","readBy":[{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2021)","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/872654","id":"872654"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/872654/responses","id":"872654"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/872654/healthservices","id":"872654"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/872654/tags","id":"872654"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rw5gj","id":"RW5GJ","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/aggressive","id":"aggressive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confused","id":"confused"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20being%20listened%20to","id":"not being listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20cared%20for","id":"not cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20listened%20to","id":"not listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scared","id":"scared"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20upset","id":"very upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dismissed","id":"dismissed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fell","id":"fell"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/osteoarthritis","id":"osteoarthritis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/panic","id":"panic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/panic%20attack","id":"panic attack"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"}]},{"id":872782,"author":"Appkl27","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Attending A and E at UHH  NHSL","body":"I wanted to highlight a very positive experience I had when I attended A and E at University Hospital Hairmyres today.

At a time where I feel lost, confused and frustrated with things I am being fobbed off with telephone conversations lasting 20 minutes in an attempt to make a decision on my mental health state. I was understanding the first couple of times but now that most things have opened up again, I am flummoxed as to why the mental health out-patients department is still closed due to what they are calling the ongoing Covid crisis. This seems to me like a fobbing off of vulnerable people in a time of need. How can a doctor assess you from a form or phone call better than face to face? No psychotherapy sessions available either, yet I can see a private chiropodist or massage therapist no problem and they are much closer to you. Please tell me when things will be put back to the way they were and patients can be treated like people and not walking contagions.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-08-24T15:36:44.0766667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-08-25T15:14:39.783","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Grampian","count":5},{"name":"Ulster University, MBBS (Medicine) 2021","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/873105","id":"873105"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/873105/responses","id":"873105"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/873105/healthservices","id":"873105"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/873105/tags","id":"873105"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/n198h-psychotherapy","id":"N198H-psychotherapy","score":2},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/angry","id":"angry"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confused","id":"confused"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frustrated","id":"frustrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/adult%20mental%20health","id":"adult mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/listening","id":"listening"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/phone%20call","id":"phone call"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/therapy","id":"therapy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vulnerable","id":"vulnerable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lack%20of%20treatment","id":"lack of treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%20restrictions","id":"covid restrictions"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/more%20face%20to%20face","id":"more face to face"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/873395","id":"873395"}]},{"id":873108,"author":"controllerjx58","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Stithians vaccine centre","body":"My son just returned from stithians show ground  \r\nAfter having had his vaccine.

They all displayed a huge amount of empathy, compassion, time and understanding. Nothing was too much trouble. They were also super efficient in organising tests and investigations which is not currently easy during the Pandemic, and the pressures that they are under.  I felt reassured as each and everyone listened to me which is so important. Everyone was so engaging, professional and kind. \nThe Pharmacy service is second to none…with prompt and efficient service. I was able to get my asthma inhaler very quickly without having to go to a Pharmacy. \nA happy, professional and cohesive team who obviously work closely together, making you feel that you are the most important person to them at the time.

We have now started the process of transferring to a new practice.\nPerhaps this is one for the ombudsman\nThe practice is going against current Government instruction to operate, as before Covid, with face to face appointments when requested.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2021-08-24T21:57:32","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2021-08-25T19:11:17","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/873449","id":"873449"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/873449/responses","id":"873449"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/873449/healthservices","id":"873449"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/873449/tags","id":"873449"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/p81002","id":"P81002","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood","id":"blood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20test","id":"blood test"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diagnosis","id":"diagnosis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/face","id":"face"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/test","id":"test"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid","id":"covid"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%2019","id":"covid 19"}]},{"id":873443,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Long waiting time and poor communication","body":"My 7-year daughter had multiple lacerations on her face.\nWe arrived at the hospital on 21 Aug at around 3:45am and she only got them stitched at around 3:45pm, all of this torture without even being allowed to eat. \nDifferent doctors told us different things about the anesthetic procedures and their risks during these long hours, and about the delay itself.\n\nIn the end, one of the nurses told me that my daughter finally woke up from the anesthetic and was ok, and said \"-we are going to bring her to the ward, but only 1 of you is allowed as a companion\". I replied saying that my wife and I were very apprehensive and we both wanted to see our daughter and check how she was, but the nurse started to give me a loud moral lesson in the corridor about the 1-companion-only rule and related Covid risks, saying that everyone needs to abide by the rules and preached at me with some personal stories of her etc..\nThen after all the moral lessons and rudeness, she finally understood that I wasn't asking for any kind of privilege, I was totally ok with the 1-companion-only rule and didn't want to force having 2 companions, all I asked was to allow both parents to see her (we're parents, we're humans, we have emotions). So we all went down to pick up my daughter and she allowed both of us to see her before she was brought back to the 1-companion-only freaking Ward 19.\nI don't know if in the beginning she mistook my request because maybe I was not very clear on what I wanted or something, but what a nightmare nurse, treated us like numbers. She has no empaty or skills for dealing with human-being parents in such a desperate situation like we were, in such a long wait, in a children's ward. She was not alone, there was another nurse/assistant with her who also didn't say a thing to reassure us about our child and silently witnessed the moral lesson we received, it's a shame.\n\nPlease call her attention to this and please don't allow a child with lacerations in the face to stay 12 hours waiting for stitches. This is inhuman, we pay taxes, this is not a favour that you are doing to us.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2021-08-24T22:05:54","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-08-25T19:12:58","readBy":[{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2022)","count":1},{"name":"University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/873443","id":"873443"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/873443/responses","id":"873443"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/873443/healthservices","id":"873443"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/873443/tags","id":"873443"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rweaa","id":"RWEAA","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/apprehensive","id":"apprehensive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/alone","id":"alone"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/desperate","id":"desperate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/face","id":"face"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stitches","id":"stitches"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/torture","id":"torture"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid","id":"covid"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%2019","id":"covid 19"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/874678","id":"874678"}]},{"id":873448,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Phone call appointment ","body":"Rang at 8am and was able to get a phone appointment for the same day.

These appointment consist of 3 hour slots during which the patient is expected to wait for the 10 minute phone call from the GP. I have many work meetings during the day and I simply do not have a 3 hour time slot that I can keep free to wait for a phone call. I find this policy entirely unreasonable. It should be possible even for phone appointments to give an approximate time, with the same risk of a slight delay that I may experience for in-person appointments.\nThe rationale given was Covid, but this logically does not make much sense. I am sure that it is a convenient way for GPs to arrange their days, but it is simply very disruptive for patients.\nThe services at this practice have got worse in several additional ways over the last two years or so. Reception staff are unfriendly and most do not know their own systems well so cannot make amendments to contact details, give access to online services etc. Appointment reminders for my daughter have been sent to me (without mentioning her name) repeatedly, leading me to think I had appointments I did not book. My daughter has had to ask 3 times to have her contact details amended.\nPrescriptions given following a doctors appointment then require and additional appointment with the pharmacist, who then promptly says I need a doctors appointment to be able to get a prescriptions. I had to phone another two times until someone finally is able to find out from the system that I already had that appointment. \nDuring in person appointments I have seen people in reception treated so incredibly unfriendly by receptionists, my jaw almost dropped. \nI cannot complain to the practice about this, as complaints just go to the practice manager, who seems to be at the center of this new policy of unhelpfulness and convoluted systems.\nI will now look for a new practice in the area, which is difficult as many are oversubscribed.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2021-08-24T10:23:05","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2021-08-25T19:17:29","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/873446","id":"873446"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/873446/responses","id":"873446"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/873446/healthservices","id":"873446"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/873446/tags","id":"873446"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/e87715","id":"E87715","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/jaw","id":"jaw"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid","id":"covid"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%2019","id":"covid 19"}]},{"id":873454,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"ask my GP service","body":"Last 2 times I have tried to use this service it has responded with 'Mile Lane Health Centre is currently unavailable for online requests'.

I appreciate any support that can be provided.\n\nParking - my mum is very old and needs support getting around - the introduction of the restricted access on the road is becoming a challenge - can you please advise the best way that she can be dropped at the front of the office without obtaining a parking ticket.  \n\nI am still waiting for the phone to be answered 40 minutes and counting\nThank you.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2021-08-25T08:04:55","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2021-08-25T19:32:28","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/873464","id":"873464"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/873464/responses","id":"873464"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/873464/healthservices","id":"873464"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/873464/tags","id":"873464"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/g85083","id":"G85083","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/great","id":"great"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/parking","id":"parking"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid","id":"covid"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%2019","id":"covid 19"}]},{"id":873458,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Sciatica pain ","body":"The A&E team were amazing ( once the pass the cue obviously) the nurses  and staff in the intensive care unit are really nice, the mri department were amazing...was all ruined by two surgeons looking at my mri...no empathy no common sense, no nothing.
