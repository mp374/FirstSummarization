Michelle, well you could not get a nicer person.  \r\nShe was calming, reassuring and done everything possible she could to help to rule out certain possibilities.  \r\nThat day, there was work being done in the hospital shoots which meant my bloods got lost temporarily.

Hospital told me I wasn't allowed to stay but I wasn't leaving my 16 year old son in their hands and if I wasn't there I don't know what would have happened to him.  \r\nHe was then transferred to sick kids at queen Elizabeth to ICU. Within an hour of being there they had to remove his canular as it wasnt in properly and the medication had been spilling out into his arm and skin. I did raise this at the HDU at royal infirmary as my sons arm was all swollen and sore and he also couldn't move or lift it. I was told it was probably just fluid! My son had a big purple/red patch all over his arm which then blistered. He still doesn’t have all the feeling back in his arm now after being home 3 weeks.  \r\nMy sons discharge papers from glasgow royal infirmary said he was being treated for sepsis.  \r\nWhen we arrived at Queen Elizabeth sick kids the difference in care is outstanding.

I joined the queue to reception anxiously waiting, a helpful volunteer eventually directed me to majors and the room in which my relative was.  \r\nI noticed the butterfly on the door, but not knowing what it meant I went in as I was directed to the room and left. Unfortunately no one had told me they had already passed over, which was a shock, when I stepped out of the room there were staff laughing and joking loudly at a desk nearby, I felt incredibly distressed at this  \r\nA nurse spotted me outside the room and realised what had happened, they were apologetic and took me to a quieter room with a cup of tea and biscuits to help me calm down, and arranged for the doctor to explain what had happened, who was compassionate and answered my questions fully giving me the time and space I needed. I can't remember the doctor's name but they were amazing.  \r\nThe nurse asked me if I wanted to know what happened next and provided me with a helpful booklet answering all my questions, and gave me as much time as I needed never rushing me. No request was too much. The nurse helped me cut some hair and take hand tracings of my relative, and when I become overwhelmed held my hand, giving me a safe space to grieve. I spent quite some time in the department, as I didn't feel ready to leave, I could hear conversations between other staff saying they wanted the room. My nurse reassured me and gave me probably a lot longer than they should have and when I started to cry on leaving hugged me and offered to walk me out of the department to my car, a walk I dreaded alone.  \r\nThis nurse truly was an angel on earth, without them the entire experience would have been traumatic. I understand it's a busy department but as an outsider looking in other staff should be respectful of the relatives of the deceased. Laughing and joking so close to my loved one felt disrespectful, the room itself was off slightly from the department and somewhere more peaceful so should be treated as such.As with reception, I think there should be a way to bypass the queue of people going through.  \r\nI want to say a special thank you to the nurse who supported me. I will never forget the love, care and dignity you showed me and my relative. Thank you so much.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-01-30T19:24:11.0533333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-02-01T12:02:39.67","readBy":[{"name":"University Hospitals Plymouth NHS Trust","count":1},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2022)","count":1},{"name":"Plymouth University, BSc Nursing (Adult) 2021","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/912700","id":"912700"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/912700/responses","id":"912700"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/912700/healthservices","id":"912700"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/912700/tags","id":"912700"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rk950_180","id":"RK950_180","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/annoyed","id":"annoyed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctor","id":"doctor"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/love","id":"love"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/noise","id":"noise"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurse","id":"nurse"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/space","id":"space"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20awareness","id":"staff awareness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/time","id":"time"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassionate","id":"compassionate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dignity","id":"Dignity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sudden%20death","id":"sudden death"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/octor","id":"octor"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/inconsiderate%20staff","id":"inconsiderate staff"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/936524","id":"936524"}]},{"id":909830,"author":"real53","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Excellent online physio classes after breast cancer surgery","body":"I was offered two physiotherapy classes after a mastectomy with a Diep reconstruction.

He was moved from his home place to Oak for initial assessment where he received excellent care from a very devoted professional team.  \r\nIntroductions occurred at the door and continued into the unit with reassuring smiles all that time from the team to my father and myself. Whilst it was a clinical set up i felt he had walked into an extension of his / our home. He was listened to, provided with a very small piece of chocolate as it eased his anxiety which demonstrated staff had been very well informed of the full history of my father.  \r\nUnknown to us he required urgent Medical care and this was received via A&E SWAH then onto ward 1, SWAH. Again his care was impeccable in ward 1 with a full plan of action and communication with our family which is crucial for us when our father is on his own in terms of being without family.  \r\nHe was discharged back to Oak and then back to Derry which is more local. We wish to thank all the staff directly and indirectly involved in his care. Alzheimer's patients are our parents, sisters / brothers, often family need to be vocal with their parents / family care but in this full un ended journey our fathers needs have been met by all which reassures worried families.  \r\nStaff managed my father like he was family, that is clear to see, they quickly understood his needs and made great strides in managing his anxieties.

I knew that I needed to seek out therapy but it took advice from the paramedics who saw to me, to help me finally realise that I needed help beyond just talking to family members.  \r\nI saw a doctor first but knew I needed more than medication. A friend suggested Inclusion, so I contacted them and they got in touch with me very quickly. I had two preliminary meetings and then I met with my therapist, Claire.  \r\nI felt proud of myself to have taken that step because I didn't have to look into the suggestion of contacting Inclusion from that friend but I did.  \r\nTalking through even the most simple aspects of my life was freeing and felt like a gift. My therapist was emphatic and kind, very honest and with that I was more than able to be honest with her too.  \r\nWe learned a lot of techniques which felt daunting at first but over a very short period of time became beneficial to my getting my life back on track.  \r\nLearning about why I behave as I do/did to situations which to some are relatively usual, I was able to break it all down into bite size pieces and really understand who I am and most importantly, why.  \r\nI will be forever grateful to Claire for her patience, kindness, honesty and for the ease in which our relationship as client/therapist evolved so quickly. To be able to speak so freely with another person really helped me.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-01-31T06:12:40.6033333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-02-01T13:41:43.683","readBy":[{"name":"Midlands Partnership NHS Foundation Trust","count":7}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/912715","id":"912715"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/912715/responses","id":"912715"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/912715/healthservices","id":"912715"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/912715/tags","id":"912715"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rrex4-inclusion-thurrock","id":"rrex4-inclusion-thurrock","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/empathy","id":"empathy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/honesty","id":"honesty"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kindness","id":"kindness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/therapist","id":"therapist"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/913236","id":"913236"}]},{"id":913175,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Useless ","body":"You cannot get through on the phone.

I was diagnosed with a skin condition in my previous surgery. However, the condition worsened towards the end of Nov'21. After 7 days of constant form-filling exercises, the doctor prescribed medicine. I am surprised that after sending photos of multiple bruises from constant scratching, no doctor was interested in seeing me. I am left with bruises and scars for the rest of my life because of doctors' negligence in providing immediate care. Moreover, my blood test results identified an issue whereby the doctor suggested a phone appointment on 24th Dec. I only came to know when I inquired about it on 28th Jan. When I mentioned no one informed me about this, I was told by the receptionist that it is the patient's responsibility. Here, I was thinking that surgery will inform me about any issue requiring attention on my blood test. This is after knowing fully well that they have more than half an hour waiting time if you phone the reception. Similar is the waiting time outside in cold weather if you walk into their surgery. Recently, they have rejected my request for a prescription saying they do not believe I have run out of medicine. Again, this wasn't informed. I only came to know when I called up after completely running out of medication. This is even after they are aware that I pay for my medication. I am amused to think that they think patients will fake medication running out.\nThis is the worst surgery in my experience, with rude staff at the reception and inconsiderate and apathetic doctors.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-01-31T21:27:09","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-02-01T13:50:38","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/913178","id":"913178"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/913178/responses","id":"913178"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/913178/healthservices","id":"913178"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/913178/tags","id":"913178"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/k81021","id":"K81021","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/apathetic","id":"apathetic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood","id":"blood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20test","id":"blood test"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bruises","id":"bruises"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/filling","id":"filling"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/informed","id":"informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scars","id":"scars"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/skin","id":"skin"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/skin%20condition","id":"skin condition"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surprised","id":"surprised"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/test","id":"test"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/917624","id":"917624"}]},{"id":912790,"author":"GKing22","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"I have been shown the greatest respect","body":"I was sent to St Margaret's Community Hospital from Perth Royal Infirmary to continue the treatment on a severe wound in my back and to be closer to home.

Recently her GP referred her to the ECDC. As you can imagine, the mere mention of the word “cancer” sparked alarm and concern in my mum and me. But our Pathway Navigator Lorna explained that a referral to this new service doesn’t necessarily always mean a cancer diagnosis will follow.  \r\nLorna telephoned my mum to advise that she had arranged CT scan for just a couple of days later on Thursday, and her results were relayed via video link on the following Monday by Nurse Specialist Katie.  \r\nStraight away Katie reassured us that nothing “sinister” had been detected on the scan. My mum still has a few issues to be followed up, but Katie will liaise with my mum’s GP surgery and other specialist colleagues about the ways forward for those, and will telephone my mum to discuss the outcomes after a meeting this Thursday.  \r\nThe whole process, from initial referral to scan results, took only a few days. It was reassuringly quick. Additionally, being able to speak to Katie via video link, and to Lorna via telephone and email, really cut down on waiting for letters, etc (Lorna really went out of her way to keep me informed about what the arrangements were at each step of the process, and to explain what to expect).  \r\nAt 88, it’s quite an ordeal for my mum to travel to and from hospital, not to mention the difficulties around parking, and is another reason why the approach of this service to distance communication was so welcomed by us.  \r\nSo, as we write, there are one or two things still outstanding to happen for my mum, but knowing people like Katie and Lorna have them in hand really takes a lot of the stress and anxiety out of the situation.We hear so much about how the NHS is struggling to cope, and I know it may put some people off coming forward for treatment, believing they either will not be seen for ages, or that their concerns are not ‘important’ enough to burden an already-struggling health service. But this new diagnostic department provides such a fantastic service, which is delivered quickly and efficiently by knowledgeable, patient and empathic staff, that we would encourage anyone to take up any offer of a referral. Both my mum and I (and the rest of the family) are extremely grateful for everything they’ve done for us.
