I feel there is no true joined up thinking when it comes to dealing with me. I am seen as complex and these days you are seen by a specialist in whatever area when something goes wrong. I feel waiting lists are pathetic, but once I was seen things may happen!  \r\nThis experience with the Northern Trust has been one of the best. The team who work to support patients who have chronic pain are just brilliant. I have learned a lot and have been able to make a number of changes to my lifestyle to help myself. In my opinion GP services are too quick to up the dosage of medication as they are not equipped with the knowledge to deal with people like me.  \r\nI am now able to drop the number of painkillers and medications to treat neurological damage and I feel so much better for it. I have changed how I manage the pain by listening to my body, resting and mindfulness. A bit of everything. The exercises are important too. I am hoping that I have the confidence to keep this going without their support. Sadly I am someone who does much better with someone watching me or in a group setting.  \r\nI would most definitely recommend this to anyone out there who really wants to make changes. I don't want to get addicted to medication. There are some which I know I have to take for the rest of my life and I really don't wish to have anymore which are a permanent fixture.  \r\nI know that because of my treatment and the aging process I will have other issues, so I am trying to do the best I can for as long as I can.

I was triaged very quickly and got an X-ray and was given painkillers. There was a very long wait which was clearly evident from the board in the department and whilst not ideal I knew what to expect. As a patient I appreciate how some people felt but I was shocked at the way the staff were spoken to by the people waiting. The staff were shouted at and received verbal abuse regularly. I would just like to say, the staff were obviously very much under pressure but when I was seen I was treated with curtesy and respect.

No phonecall to tell me not to come, NOTHING! Then when I asked if there was someone else in the hospital who could see my little boy (who I guessed needed their milk changed again) they said no & to go back to GP. I said GP won't do anything as I'm under paediatrician now. I asked could they ring STH to see if any appointments there that week, only to be told that a clinican needs to ring. I didnt think that was correct so I rang STH myself & got speaking to a lovely staff member who apologised for the morning I'd had & put me straight through to talk to a paediatrician.

Without the Fern Centre, I wouldn't have been able to get support and vital information and wonderful massages, and reassurance for mum, who would have had to sit in random cafe with no one to talk to about what i was going through and support for her.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-08-12T08:35:56.5033333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-08-15T13:00:06.52","readBy":[{"name":"Royal Devon University Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust","count":3}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/965527","id":"965527"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/965527/responses","id":"965527"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/965527/healthservices","id":"965527"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/965527/tags","id":"965527"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rh880-fern-centre","id":"RH880-fern-centre","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/volunteers","id":"volunteers"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/warm","id":"warm"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/welcoming","id":"welcoming"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/like%20family","id":"like family"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/966215","id":"966215"}]},{"id":965528,"author":"Ferny","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"On-site accommodation alleviated stress","body":"Our Mum was taken ill, while on holiday.

Each time I had very different experiences with the health visiting team.  \r\nWhen I had my oldest, I was very young myself, 17 going 18, intact! Although young, it wasn’t my first experience caring for a baby but still grieving from the loss of my father. I battled with the anxiety of something happing to my newborn and it soon spiralled into post-natal depression. The Healthvisitor I had at the time seemed nice but wasn’t very “coothie” and I didn’t feel I could open up to her, about how I felt things were going and being the young mother I was, I didn’t feel I got the reassurance I think I needed. I didn’t really like the idea of her coming and I would often reschedule and eventually relied on other people for advice ( which now I see, wasn’t a good choice either). It was made clear that her visits were solely for the welfare of my child. Latterly, another Healthvisitor would visit me and I really enjoyed her company and felt very much at ease because I felt that she spoke to me as a parent, rather than through a book.  \r\nWhen I had my middle child, 5 years later, I requested the Healthvisitor that I had latterly because I knew her and I felt very much at ease and at that time, my request was honoured. It was such a relief to myself and my husband because she knew how I was with my oldest and she knew me as a person and I felt that was personalised family care, which is how things should be! It helped to make my experience much more comfortable and I felt more secure as a parent. The birth of my son was quite traumatic, this time, so the warmth and care I received from this Healthvisitor was very welcomed and I felt like she was genuinely concerned for my welfare as well as my babies.  \r\nWhen I fell pregnant with my youngest child, I was an older mum, with a 7year age gap from my middle child, to my daughter being born. My circumstances were very much different and with working full-time (and unknowingly dealing with fibromyalgia) I was struggling physically. My daughter was 5 weeks premature, my uterus had ruptured ( which wasn’t discovered until her birth) and I had gestational diabetes throughout my pregnancy. This time I, again, requested my previous Healthvisitor but due to the change in GP practice, it couldn’t be done. However, the support I have received from the Healthvisitor I was allocated has been phenomenal. She become to know me as a mother and as a person, again this made the care and support more personal for me and my family and that’s what she always showed, that mattered most. I was encouraged, supported, made to feel valued as a mother and that my concerns were acknowledged and I was given advise on how to deal with things if that was what was needed. I always felt comfortable in her company, she was respectful and down to earth. I felt like I could take any advice she had to give and trusted her whole heartedly. I will always hold her in my heart for how she supported me and my family. ❤️","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-08-11T09:48:31.1166667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-08-15T14:33:23.3","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Tayside","count":9},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2022)","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/965205","id":"965205"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/965205/responses","id":"965205"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/965205/healthservices","id":"965205"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/965205/tags","id":"965205"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/st9-community-services-hv-angus","id":"st9-community-services-hv-angus","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nervous","id":"nervous"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/advice","id":"advice"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/birth","id":"birth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/depression","id":"depression"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fibromyalgia","id":"fibromyalgia"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gestational%20diabetes","id":"gestational diabetes"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pregnancy","id":"pregnancy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pregnant","id":"pregnant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/respect","id":"respect"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/uterus","id":"uterus"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/personal%20approach","id":"personal approach"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/making%20sure%20all%20health%20visitors%20give%20the%20same%20care","id":"making sure all health visitors give the same care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/become%20to%20feel%20valued%20with%20better%20healthvisitors","id":"become to feel valued with better healthvisitors"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1031569","id":"1031569"}]},{"id":964671,"author":"alginon","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Wrong medication given","body":"Was admitted into Combined assessment unit in August, 2022. Was taken in by ambulance, who had my own prescription with them and they passed this on to the doctor. Was kept in for 6 days, after having bad seizures, headache, loss of balance and blurred vision. During the 6 days I was given medication morning and evening. I questioned the medication every time I was given it. I knew it wasn't the medication I normally took, each time I questioned it, I was told that this was what the doctor had prescribed. So thinking the doctor knows best, I took the medication.  \r\nOn the day I was told I could come home, and still not feeling right, a member of staff came to me and told me that they were very sorry, they had to tell me I had been given the wrong medication throughout my stay. Next, another member of staff came to see me from the hospital office, and also told me I had been given wrong medication, and that an investigation will be held. I came home that day with a list of the wrong medication.  \r\nI have no problems with the nurses care I received, They were all lovely.  \r\nI have had no notification whatsoever about this investigation that is supposed to be being held.  \r\nYesterday, I phoned the hospital to try and speak to the person dealing with this. After being passed from pillar to post, trying to find out which office deals with this, I was told there isn't an office in the hospital that deals with this problem. So I am still none the wiser.  \r\nA suggestion for the future - when a patient questions their medication, maybe staff should double check.  \r\nHad to go to my own GP recently. Still got symptoms mentioned above, they said this mistake should never ever have happened.  \r\nI am very upset and unhappy that I had had wrong medication and wasn't listened to.  \r\nI still don't know what is happening with the ongoing investigation.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-08-09T15:52:34.58","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-08-15T14:36:12.903","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Ayrshire & Arran","count":12}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/964671","id":"964671"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/964671/responses","id":"964671"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/964671/healthservices","id":"964671"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/964671/tags","id":"964671"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/a111h_180","id":"A111H_180","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/a111h-cau","id":"A111H-CAU","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20being%20listened%20to","id":"not being listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ambulance","id":"ambulance"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/balance","id":"balance"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blurred%20vision","id":"blurred vision"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/contact","id":"contact"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/headache","id":"headache"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/information","id":"information"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/investigation","id":"investigation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lovely%20staff","id":"lovely staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mistake","id":"mistake"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/prescription","id":"Prescription"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unhappy","id":"unhappy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vision","id":"vision"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication%20error","id":"medication error"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/non%20epileptic%20seizures","id":"non epileptic seizures"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/966254","id":"966254"}]},{"id":965212,"author":"Kelly/Fam","authorRoleId":4,"authorRole":"a relative","title":"Our mum is doing great","body":"My mum started with really sore legs.

Now you can't get an appointment without creating a fuss. In general the patient facing (non-medical) staff are lovely but they are forced to work to a system which just isn't fit for purpose. When you do get to see a doctor they also are great - it just shouldn't be such a battle to do so. There doesn't seem to be any adherence to a 'duty of care' overall.\n\nTwice in the last week I've had to ring the surgery. The first time I had to try constantly to even get the phone answered only to be automatically put in a queue and then got cut off when the phone was eventually answered at the surgery. I then had to start again and finally got to speak to some one after 90 minutes of trying/queuing, only to be told there were no appointments (in fact, I was told there were no doctors on duty that day but I did get to see a lesser qualified clinician later the same day). The second time it was over 30 minutes before I got to speak to someone. This archaic system means that stress levels for all concerned are immense - patients, having to ring at a time many should be on their way to work or getting ready to do so and then being held in a queue for ages, plus the staff whose mental health must be affected by the stressed patients taking their frustrations out on them when its not their fault.\n\nIn my view patients need to be able to ring surgeries at a time to suit the patient not the surgery, the \"8 o'clock lottery\", as its 'affectionally' known needs to be knocked on the head ASAP. The surgery needs to employ enough staff to answer the calls within five minutes (or less) and office staff must be utilised to answer phones if that target is not being met. There should also be enough doctors on duty to deal with all the people who request to see them. In addition, patients should be able to see the same doctor most times they visit (allowing for holidays and home visit rotas). Since joining this surgery, when seeing the same doctor was the norm, I've been seen by more and more, and different, locums which doesn't give a good continuity of care or allow either side to develop a good professional relationship.\n\nThe fact that I, and many others, have felt it necessary to write a review such as this shows the surgery is failing its patients. Please put things right and make patients the top of your priorities as it doesn't appear to be the case at the moment.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-08-15T13:53:14","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2022-08-15T21:12:43","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/966301","id":"966301"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/966301/responses","id":"966301"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/966301/healthservices","id":"966301"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/966301/tags","id":"966301"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/f81164","id":"F81164","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stress","id":"stress"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/concerned","id":"concerned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/continuity","id":"continuity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/get%20fit","id":"get fit"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/head","id":"head"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20good","id":"not good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20concerned","id":"very concerned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20great","id":"not great"}]},{"id":966315,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Waiting Times","body":"Current advice is ring daily at 8am to see if you can get a same day appointment, to book an appointment it will be about a 6 week wait.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-08-15T14:52:01","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-08-15T21:13:09","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/966315","id":"966315"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/966315/responses","id":"966315"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/966315/healthservices","id":"966315"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/966315/tags","id":"966315"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/p86022","id":"P86022","score":null},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/966878","id":"966878"}]},{"id":966316,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"No duty of care for patience ","body":"I have been trying to get an appointment for quite a serious matter for 3 months.

There's no point asking 'what the problem is' when they answer the call as it doesn't feel like they're triaging the concerns and booking the appointment as per urgency, but rather on a first come first serve basis.
