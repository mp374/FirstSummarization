My worst fear, when going into the appointment, was that I'd be laughed out of the room, and that was pretty much what I got.

She couldn't have cared less about my problems, had a bad & unfriendly attitude and I left the surgery in tears, feeling worse than when I went in. I felt completely belittled.

At my request I was given sedatives before the procedure, and during an uncomfortable part of it was given gas and air.  A small polyp was removed and I was left feeling at ease and comfortable.  After the procedure I was wheeled into a ward bay and my BP was taken every ten minutes for twenty minutes, after which I was given tea and biscuits.  I cannot fault the unit or staff, and would be very much at ease should I require another colonoscopy.  This appoint was a whole different experience from one I had in the same unrefurbished unit in 2011, when I was told they didn't do sedatives, the nurse doing the colonoscopy remarked why did she get all the hysterectomy patients, and that the steralizing unit had broken down the night before but not to worry as the scopes were steralizing in a bucket. I not only suffered humilation and pain but came away worrying I might have contracted some sort of disease from the scope.  A very unpleasant experience.

As a first time mum with a history of mental health, the Magnolia team were exactly what I needed. They were so helpful, highly experienced, open, honest and supportive -I was able to text whenever I was worried about something and they would respond. The only time I was upset was after having a glucose test which was high and the doctors seemed to think I had gestational diabetes because scans were showing that my baby was bigger than average. Both of these proved to be false in the end and it was a shame to have been made to worry so much in the lead up to the birth. The midwife that was there with me for the birth of my son went above and beyond her duty - ordering lunch and not stopping for lunch break, working past her 12 hour shift on New Year's Eve of all days! After birth the midwives that came to visit gave excellent advise and helped to make my feel at ease with being a new mum.   I'm very lucky to have had their support.

Went because when I contacted my GP practice the previous day, they informed me that the first appointment available was in 12 days time [another failing part of the Primary Care service of the NHS]. This was unacceptable as I was pretty certain that my problem was a recurrence of Shingles - with attendant pain and rashes. The prescription and used of anti-viral drugs/cream s is the normal treatment; but has to be started early on to be effective. Booked in and seen by the triage nurse. When I queried the receptionist [who had obviously missed the customer service course] after a 1.5 hour wait why several people who came after me were seeing the doctor first, I was told that this was up to the nurse and her decision on priority, I understand that but when 50% of those who arrived after you go ahead of you, the impression is that you do not matter. At that point I decided to leave as I was not prepared to wait until everyone else had been seen. The underlying problems are lack of training in triage, insufficient clinical staff numbers to deal with the patients presenting and poor management.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-02-01T11:29:58","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-02-02T09:03:09","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/738736","id":"738736"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/738736/responses","id":"738736"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/738736/healthservices","id":"738736"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/738736/tags","id":"738736"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/y04538","id":"Y04538","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cream","id":"cream"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/drugs","id":"drugs"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/normal","id":"normal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/shingles","id":"shingles"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/triage","id":"triage"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/919142","id":"919142"}]},{"id":738734,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Wonderful Team","body":"The Team in MIU were fabulous, really friendly and caring.

I actually was in tears when I left will be making a formal complaint.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-02-02T03:31:48","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-02-02T09:25:27","readBy":[{"name":"Medway Community Healthcare","count":1},{"name":"NHS Medway CCG","count":2}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/738749","id":"738749"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/738749/responses","id":"738749"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/738749/healthservices","id":"738749"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/738749/tags","id":"738749"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/nq782","id":"NQ782","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bowels","id":"bowels"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dying","id":"dying"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/739227","id":"739227"}]},{"id":738748,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Fantastic care","body":"Thank you for the excellent service,I received while on wads 27 and ESA,the surgeon and all the excellent nursing team,they are a credit to your hospital,nothing was to much trouble to any of them ,","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-02-02T06:06:52","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-02-02T09:26:43","readBy":[{"name":"York and Scarborough Teaching Hospital NHS Foundation Trust","count":2}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/738748","id":"738748"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/738748/responses","id":"738748"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/738748/healthservices","id":"738748"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/738748/tags","id":"738748"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rcb55","id":"RCB55","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/740185","id":"740185"}]},{"id":738746,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"SEAU-SAL -Anesthetist and surgeons  ","body":"After my recent visit i am not one to make a big fuss as i know all staff are in a great deal of pressure ,I would like to thanks all staff in all departments for the care i received ,you work miracles for your patients even when over stretched and under staffed  .Thank You","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-02-02T07:52:31","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-02-02T09:27:03","readBy":[{"name":"United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust","count":13}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/738746","id":"738746"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/738746/responses","id":"738746"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/738746/healthservices","id":"738746"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/738746/tags","id":"738746"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rwdda","id":"RWDDA","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/739579","id":"739579"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/739834","id":"739834"}]},{"id":738750,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Great ward and staff.
