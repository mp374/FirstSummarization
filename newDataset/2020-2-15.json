Immediately noticed all reception staff used first names, were friendly in manner and most helpful in ensuring appropriate appointments were achieved. \nAppointments with the two practice nurses reaffirmed these initial perceptions of the practice with both presenting a friendly and personal approach whilst dealing with the clinical matters.  One did not linger but at the same time not left with that feeling of being shown the door.  Having given injections it was a pleasure when on the receiving end of these to have them administered competently, meaning accurately, painlessly and in alternating sites.  Thank you both.\nDoctors seen have appeared to possess an appreciation of the impact an ailment has on one.  Perhaps the best example to describe this would be the doctor following up by phoning our home to check on progress and any further concerns following an incident earlier in the week. Never known this elsewhere.\nThis practice seems to have an awareness of how to treat the person as well as the illness and injury making both just a little less traumatic.  \nIt is, therefore, a shame that, like so many practices, it is having to combine with others in the obligatory modern block as inevitably qualities described above will suffer with ever increasing patient numbers. It’s also suspected that a further valued quality will be diluted, that of continuity in getting the same doctor and nurse.\nHowever, thank you to all mentioned as we are unfortunately leaving your catchment area.

At the time of registration, I used to be perpetually exhausted. They have given timely care and appropriate treatment, advise and given me a new life I must add. Quality of life transformed immensely and I now look much younger and am healthier and fitter than most people of my age. I almost always get appointments for reviews, even doctors themselves advise me of a date for review.\n\nHowever the practice management is poor. The patients council is a closed group. There is no information on this although we are told it is. If you enquire you would be directed to the practice manager who keeps it closed to a selected few. There are no feedback forms, instead just a box. Overall non-medical input is very poor, perhaps they don't quite represent the demographic of the catchment area they serve.\n\nI however have not faced any appointment  or telephonic assistance waiting issues. Those at the reception appear to be excellent and obliging. I would rate the staff are good overall, doctors excellent but the management need to welcome service users of all backgrounds to be pro-actively involved in service provisions. The environment seems to be too controlling and so clients are not heard, it would seem. For this reason I have noticed that the surgery is stagnant and slightly dated in terms of service provisions. \n\nAn excellent primary care would not only create a healthier and self-aware community but also save NHS immense resources.

They have two people on the front desk who have to deal with the phones and people coming in. This is ok in a one or even two dr practice. But in such a large medical centre does not work. This is what infuriates your patients and where most of your complaints come from. Patients get angry for being on hold for so long and then feel they can’t get what they want/need from you and believe it’s because the staff are rude. When really it’s because of how long they have been waiting. You should have 2 dedicated staff on the phones and one on the front. Then this can be swapped throughout the day so staff do a variety of work. This means the calls would not be on hold for so long. Sometimes even a hour. Which is just ridiculous. You are expanding so really should think about changing the way reception is run.

On arrival the ambulance area looked overflowing as was reception. I was quickly and efficiently taken through to the 'majors hub' with my wife. Even though I was feeling very unwell, with a blinding headache, light sensitivity and dry retching following an extended period of vomiting, it seemed every available space was taken by trolleys with patients. at 6.00-6.30pm it was not what I would have thought to be a busy time for A&E. Considering how busy it was I was seen incredibly quickly. This is not the place to give an account listing my treatment. The fact it included a CT scan, an overnight stay on ACU, assurance by overworked staff that we had done exactly the right thing in using their service even though the final diagnosis of 'food poisoning' was not as bad as they had feared is what is relevant. \nFollowing my treatment I have nothing but respect and admiration for every member of the team I came in contact with throughout my stay. In the early hours of Friday morning when I was beginning to feel a little more human myself, I became even more aware of the skills of nursing and medical staff working 12.5 hour night shifts. Diagnosing, treating, patiently explaining and supporting patients and family members. The response was as varied as the range of ailments being treated. If the staff had employed any less skill or patience I am sure the atmosphere could have been far more hostile.\nAt 66 I am fortunate that I do not have to avail myself of many of the NHS services. Although I do seem to have made more demands in the last 5 years. I do not consider my self a very politically active member of the community but I do like to give praise where it is due. I could not have asked more from the NHS than that which was given to me at Good Hope hospital. As a country I hope that the recent political interest and promises to the NHS are held to account. Equally that essential related issues such as Adult Social care services are tackled promptly and in a unified manner. Not, as in the past, delayed because they are too difficult to handle. The pressure  this failure was putting on Good Hope A&E team, throughout that Thursday night early Friday morning, could not have been more obvious. Yes, it will need to be paid for. Let us hope the time is right for these issues to be tackled!\nMy thanks to Good Hope staff\n","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-02-15T19:31:05","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-02-15T19:37:59","readBy":[{"name":"University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/742265","id":"742265"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/742265/responses","id":"742265"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/742265/healthservices","id":"742265"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/742265/tags","id":"742265"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rrk98","id":"RRK98","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ct","id":"ct"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ct%20scan","id":"CT scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diagnosis","id":"diagnosis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/failure","id":"failure"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/food%20poisoning","id":"food poisoning"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fortunate","id":"fortunate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good","id":"good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/headache","id":"headache"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/included","id":"included"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scan","id":"scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vomiting","id":"vomiting"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hope","id":"Hope"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/admiration","id":"admiration"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/747543","id":"747543"}]},{"id":742269,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Good patient care","body":"I attended for a procedure.

Disturbed on arrival not only by the lack of parking but by the subtle branding seen everywhere by Virgin. Is this the beginning of the end for the NHS? I was called on time, had to be taken through wards as there was construction work taking place, but wondered whether that was good practice considering the dangers of infection. In the room two practitioners , one a Virgin employee who basically ignored me. The other who was using the equipment very quickly suggested that the equipment was not the best, and recommended a second visit to the RHU. Despite being told that the result would be explained to me, in the leaflet telling how the process would work, this did not happen. I was then shown out of the room to negotiated the building work without proper directions. A few days later I got the results from my own doctor who concurred with getting a second screening done. Felt like a waste of my time, the Virgin person seemed utterly redundant, and seemed to contribute nothing to the process. Presumably by care was billed to the NHS. I wouldn’t fly Virgin so would have liked to know that this facility, whose parent company is based of shore, and presumably profiting that company rather than as is hoped for within the NHS, being free at every level, paid for through mine and others taxes. If this is the future I despair. A second NHS cardiogram in an NHS hospital as this one wasn’t good enough. Perhaps thats because cardiology wasn’t on the tick list , which it should be if you provide these services, so I had to tick don’t know to continue. That sums up the situation really. If it’s offered in your care options ask if you can make a different choice.
