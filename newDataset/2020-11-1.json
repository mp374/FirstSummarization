The practice did not even event attempt to take note of my relatives’s details, nature of the problem or urgency of the situation. Rather, I was advised to either wait until 6.30pm and contact the out of hours service or ring 111. I asked for a copy of the practice’s complaints form but, having taken my details, I am still waiting for this to arrive . \n\nI then spent a considerable amount of time trying to contact 111 who were very helpful, took note of my concerns, took an appropriate history to assess the urgency of the problem and, on the basis of this,  advised me to contact my relative’s GP practice ie the James Cochrane Practice! When I explained the refusal of the practice to even acknowledge my concerns they contacted the practice and managed to arrange for a telephone call back.  \n\nI appreciate that the present Covid situation has affected normal working practices but nonetheless am shocked that the practice can control workload by simply declining to even assess the urgency of a problem and inappropriately deflect workload to other equally hard-presses agencies.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-11-01T00:24:19","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-11-01T15:47:25","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/800251","id":"800251"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/800251/responses","id":"800251"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/800251/healthservices","id":"800251"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/800251/tags","id":"800251"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/a82026","id":"A82026","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/shocked","id":"shocked"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/elderly","id":"elderly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frail","id":"frail"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/in%20control","id":"in control"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/normal","id":"normal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/safe","id":"safe"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/801445","id":"801445"}]},{"id":800252,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Initial service led to some failures ","body":"I can’t speak highly enough of the person who took my call.

So we have been through a wide range of hospital services and wards.\n\nWe have been consistently impressed by the service we have received. Medically the care given has been excellent, prompt and thoughtfully planned with the individual circumstances of the patient in mind. In both cases my parents have made great recoveries despite being 89 and having many frailties.\n\nThe human care and compassion has been good. At its best we have been stunned by the extra mile some staff have gone to support us. There have been a few instances when staff have been less caring, maybe leaving them too long when they need to go to the toilet or being abrupt. However, we are all human and I cannot imagine how hard it is for staff at the moment.\n\nIf I had one suggestion it would be that more needs to be done to keep family informed since visiting is impossible.

This procedure was at one time for urgent cases or emergencies only, and for a small handful of slots, but has now become the norm. \nA new telephone system makes it virtually impossible to speak to the surgery - you can make numerous calls over a number of days before you are able to get through to reception. By which point the appointments have already gone and you are told to try again the following day. There is no answer machine or facility to leave a voice message. \nThe practices website is no longer available.\nThe surgery pushed Patient Access and other apps but now this seems to be a way of requesting repeat prescriptions only. You can no longer book appointments using this method. The practice should consider using the Messaging facility on Patient Access which may alleviate the constant, repeat telephone calls and patient frustration at not being able to speak to anyone for a number of days.\nGetting an actual appointment with a GP is now a rarity - at best you are promised a call back which tends to come from Nurse-led areas rather than a Doctor. Callbacks are promised but no times given. One call is attempted, from a withheld number, and no message is left so if you miss the call you cannot contact the Doctor/Nurse and then have to start the whole process again the following day.\nIts a shame as this was a really good practice with good staff but modernising services has not been for the benefit of the patient at all.

Firstly can I say this was prompt work from my GP to see me in a 'hot bay' clinic having been Covid positive 18 days ago and get me straight into the hospital.  \r\nThe staff met me with a smile and kind reassuring words. They arranged tests, bloods firstly as they knew they'd be an hour in the lab (only 1hr! ! ) Then onto sats, ECG, an Dr Moon examination of my chest. Then off for chest xray, I didnt even get to sit down it was that quick and straight back to Dr Moon for results.  \r\nA further smile, gentle explanation and refer for CT. I cant have been waiting there for 10minutes when called in promptly by a radiologist who quickly and professionally identified my cannula was not in the vein but in 'tissue'. He placed another effortlessly and CT scan completed.  \r\nWhile all this was going on inside the hospital, outside my husband and 3yr old waiting for me had toilet issues (we rushed out of the house with nothing in hand and no thoughts they were not allowed in the building due to Covid restrictions) and when the staff overheard my conversation offered wipes and continence pad for my daughter if needed! Talk about over and above!  \r\nDawn and Dr moon were amazing. Luckily the car had some supplies to help the little girls accident. I was then given results, the explanation thorough and comprehensive. I felt in awe, such wonderful, prompt, amazing care from start to finish. What I felt could have been improved was the clinic areas/environments these amazing people have to work in. Clearly a great service, shoe-horned into old office space, so when I nearly fainted having my canula inserted the first time, I was unable to lie on a couch as the clinic rooms were in use by another service. The constraints of a critical service evident. These clinicians are making the best of what they have been given but must be disheartened to know what they do is let down by the environment they've been provided. I hope RCHT can find these wonderful services and staff the facilities they clearly deserve.  \r\nI would like xray and CT to know they were amazing, prompt and professional. I would also like Dawn and Dr Moon to know how amazing they are, how they made an awful day tolerable with a smile and giggle along the way. And I'd love RCHT to be bigger, if more clinic rooms are needed for these essential services. But mainly, a massive THANK YOU for being there at all and working amazingly with what you've got.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-10-21T08:43:17.2033333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-11-02T09:20:01.203","readBy":[{"name":"Royal Cornwall Hospitals NHS Trust","count":8},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2020)","count":1},{"name":"Sheffield University Medical School 2020","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/797104","id":"797104"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/797104/responses","id":"797104"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/797104/healthservices","id":"797104"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/797104/tags","id":"797104"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l82028","id":"L82028","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/ref12","id":"REF12","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/above%20and%20beyond","id":"above and beyond"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/accommodation","id":"accommodation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazed","id":"amazed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/chest","id":"chest"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ct","id":"ct"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ct%20scan","id":"CT scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ecg","id":"ecg"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/environment","id":"environment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/explanation","id":"explanation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/facilities","id":"facilities"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/important","id":"important"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kindness","id":"kindness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professionalism","id":"professionalism"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/prompt","id":"prompt"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/prompt%20referral","id":"prompt referral"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassurance","id":"reassurance"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/referral","id":"referral"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/respected","id":"respected"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scan","id":"scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/seen%20quickly","id":"seen quickly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attitude","id":"staff attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tests","id":"tests"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thorough","id":"thorough"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wait%20for%20results","id":"wait for results"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/xray","id":"Xray"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/802042","id":"802042"}]},{"id":797805,"author":"Wendy2222","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Once chance GP call","body":"I made an appointment to have a call from GP.

The painkillers did help slightly with the pain but I couldn’t really move around without any pain. If I lay in the right position I could stop the pain. It felt like a nerve pain.  \r\nI spoke to someone on the 111 line 5am as I had woken up from a night of interrupted sleep with intense stomach cramps. They reassured me and said it was probably from the medication and told me to make sure I ate more whilst taking the tablets. The next 48 hours are a bit blurry but I had a few calls with the GP and then 111 as I was struggling to manage the pain.  \r\nI always consider myself to have a high pain threshold but this was quite difficult to manage.Early morning a few days later it got really bad when I was trying to go for a wee and I thought I was going to be sick. I was refused additional Pain-relief that afternoon by another GP which I found a bit difficult because I was in so much pain. I do understand this was because codeine is addictive but I was definitely running out of stamina by this point.  \r\nLuckily, on that night the abscess ruptured and a lot of red, thick liquid came out. The sharp, hot pain dropped off within minutes and I could walk upright again. There was another burst of liquid at around 2am which happened as I was opening my bowels. The pain came back but then subsided quite quickly. Over the weekend the pain continued to subside and I was able to walk again. I have finished the course of antibiotics and now have an acorn sized lump which I am continuing to bathe.  \r\nDr Park told me to continue to bathe it and to not have intercourse until the puncture wound has healed. This is probably the worst thing that has happened to me from a medical point of view. I guess I’m lucky really! I did find it very difficult to manage the pain and I think because I was told by A&E that it’d start to improve after 24 hours and it took about 60 hours for my pain to subside I struggled.  \r\nAlso, nobody who I spoke to once I was in pain really asked me what the pain was like or how bad it was so I have no perception of whether what I was feeling was normal for a bartholin abscess. Other than this feedback, everyone I spoke to was really great and very supportive. I’m very grateful for the care that I received. This week I feel like a new person!","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-10-28T09:23:41.3466667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-11-02T09:20:05.167","readBy":[{"name":"Lower Clapton Group Practice","count":5},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2020)","count":3},{"name":"Sheffield University Medical School 2020","count":1},{"name":"Homerton University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust","count":2},{"name":"City & Hackney GP Confederation","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/799079","id":"799079"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/799079/responses","id":"799079"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/799079/healthservices","id":"799079"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/799079/tags","id":"799079"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/f84003","id":"F84003","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rqxm1_180","id":"RQXM1_180","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/abscess","id":"abscess"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/access%20to%20pain%20relief","id":"access to pain relief"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/antibiotics","id":"antibiotics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bartholin","id":"Bartholin"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctor","id":"doctor"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/speed","id":"speed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supportive","id":"supportive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/801048","id":"801048"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/801061","id":"801061"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/801305","id":"801305"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/801479","id":"801479"}]}]
