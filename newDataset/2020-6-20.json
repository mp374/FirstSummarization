Both times I have  telephoned I have spoken to polite and helpful reception staff who have put through to equally kind and helpful doctors . Both doctors took time to listen to my concerns without making me feel I was taking to much of their time in what must be an extremely busy time for them . A big thank you to all concerned.\nWe all to often here about how difficult it is to get GP's appointments and how awful the whole system is. Well I think Paxton Green are doing a great job and their system  is excellent. I have been a patient  for over 20 years and would not ever want to be a patient Anywhere  else.

I suffer with depression and am struggling on the medication I have been provided with, therefore looking to change anti depressant. Over the past month or so I have been calling to speak to one specific dr who I feel comfortable talking with and who knows my background as I need to change to a different anti depressant. Each time I called the surgery I was told to call on a specific day the following week as the dr I wanted to speak with wasn’t working. So I would. This happened 4 times!!! All the while i am slowly running out of my current meds. I even asked if I could be contacted when she’s next in and that wasn’t an option. Not once was I told that it wasn’t definite that the dr would be in work on those occasions. So each time I called I would mention that I was told to call on this specific day and I would just get told by the receptionists “well she’s not in”. If I had been told at the start that drs are not guaranteed to be in work on the days specified then I would of course had to speak with a different dr! I have now had to go back onto sertraline just to keep the anti depressant in my system. I ran out of the drug for a week and suffered horrific side effects - no thanks to TMC! The surgery may be working on a rota but any decent surgery would let their patients know that there is a possibility drs won’t be in on the days they specify! They have zero care for people’s well-being and have not bothered responding to the email I sent to them over a week ago. I don’t think they realise they have a duty of care! I am now in the process of switching doctors and would not recommend this surgery at all. If I could give it no stars I would. I understand we are at the tail end of a pandemic but that does not mean they can fob their patients off and show no duty of care.

An ambulance was dispatched immediately from Totnes, and arrived as quickly as the roads allowed.  By then the spasms and pain had abated.  The two ambulance team were absolutely terrific.\nThey did the most thorough check - up of my condition, with all the appropriate tests.  Another doctor also arrived but soon afterwards departed as it was clear that there was no further need for support.  \nOnce all the necessary checks had been carried out and proved that all was in order, the senior medic telephoned a consultant at Torbay Hospital, to make sure it had not been caused by DVT to the leg.  He confirmed that everything was fine with none of the signs that would indicate this was the cause of the problem.\nI am blessed with good health and never have occasion to require the emergency services.  How reassuring that when the need arises, you are met by such professionalism and care.  The ambulance crew were meticulous and thorough in their check-ups and I am completely restored to full health now.\nI would like to use this opportunity to sincerely thank them for their help.

This has cost me about another 500 pounds and delayed me in getting the correct diagnosis.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-06-16T17:39:36.0533333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-06-22T09:20:02.72","readBy":[{"name":"Shepton Mallet NHS Treatment Centre","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/772617","id":"772617"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/772617/responses","id":"772617"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/772617/healthservices","id":"772617"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/772617/tags","id":"772617"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/ntph1","id":"NTPH1","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appalling","id":"appalling"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mri","id":"mri"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ripped%20off","id":"ripped off"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scan","id":"scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/access%20to%20results","id":"access to results"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/773802","id":"773802"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/773836","id":"773836"}]},{"id":773063,"author":"yankeekd99","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Believing I could change","body":"I would like to thank Telford Stars and my worker Michelle for having the belief that I could change.  \r\nWithout that support, I would not be here now.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-06-19T12:53:04.3433333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-06-22T10:04:04.08","readBy":[{"name":"Midlands Partnership NHS Foundation Trust","count":3}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/773063","id":"773063"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/773063/responses","id":"773063"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/773063/healthservices","id":"773063"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/773063/tags","id":"773063"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rrex4-telfordandwrekin","id":"RREX4-telfordandwrekin","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/key%20worker","id":"key worker"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/773667","id":"773667"}]},{"id":773065,"author":"Webbetta","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Telephone consultation","body":"I was called by my consultant who was very informative and helpful.

They did not ring at the scheduled time and they discharged me. Much legwork resulted in my being offered cbt face to face. I was really pleased but the 1 hour plus first session resulted in the therapist essentially saying I was too bad for cbt, (I had had a crisis recently, involving Samaritans) and they should come to me rather than me go to them. Disappointed I accepted this. But no one came. I have in the last 3 months had three phone calls, amounting to a further 2.5 hours of assessment and my having no clue what could be on the horizon. After more of my own pushing and legwork and co fusion I am finally told I will get a navigator and a transformer, (whatever one of them might be). No promised reports have arrived. I have still no named professional. I wait for any care plan. Essentially I have been largely left in a highly vulnerable position, suffering some horrific weekends with st's, unsupported. I have waited week after week after week left in the dark. 5 hours of assessment to date, passed around, and still have no help. A completely ineffective and time wasting service to date. It's been ten months now since my initial referral. I note the parallels of my story to the other reviews here, which are also reminiscence of the \"service\" I received 8 years ago when I was also passed around as I was too \"complicated\" and yes, ultimately discharged. Whilst not my intention, it is entirely possible that I could have succumbed to intrusive thoughts, and there would be no come back as dead men don't complain. I can't comment on any therapy or direct help as there has been none. However, whilst all people have been polite and professional it is absolutely clear that organization and management of cases is a compete sham. 5 hours of assessment over ten months, zero input. This service is an insult to its clients, needs demolishing, and rebuilding properly from the ground up.

Plus, during the pandemic, it definitely seems like the safe and speedier option to get important info out fast, so it's great to see this happening.  \r\nOn April 14th, a message was sent to patients encouraging us to sign up to the electronic prescription service.  \r\nI received this SMS message at 9:38am, 9:39am and 9:41am. I assumed there was a problem and perhaps someone had accidentally clicked 'send' twice, but when the third text arrived I thought surely that can't happen three times. When just 2 texts had arrived I wondered if it was my fault and maybe I'd accidentally given them my details twice? But that doesn't really make sense either. Perhaps the system has duplicates and they weren't sent three times, but some people's numbers were in the system multiple times? I'm not sure. Either way, I thought oh gosh I hope that hasn't cost them triple the amount of money it needed to. Plus, and I know this sounds really petty in the scheme of things, but it was slightly annoying receiving three of the same message while trying to work.  \r\nI considered sharing feedback at the time, but there's no obvious way to do so and I assumed they would be very aware of this mistake and would have fixed it. When I received a new message about signing up to the health app on April 15th, and only received it once, I thought, great! They've fixed the issue, no need to feedback.  \r\nBut then today (12/06/20) I've been sent the same message 4 times. It's about wearing a mask when attending the surgery, obviously very important info to send out but it would seem the problem hasn't been fixed. I received this same message at 8:48, 9:26, 9:53 and 10:19am. Again, really quite annoying. Plus, if I wasn't working I think I'd be annoyed if this work me up, it's quite early in the morning to send a message to people who may still be sleeping.  \r\nAnyway, I just wanted to feedback because there's clearly an issue here that may be costing our already underfunded and much needed GP practices up to 4 times more money than necessary and I'm hoping there is a quick fix! Fingers crossed this helps in some way. And again, I just wanted to say I think it's great that the practices are sending out messages in this way at a time when physical contact must be kept to a minimum, it's a great way to communicate effectively and efficiently.  \r\n[Very unhappy with 'Keeping in touch']  \r\n  \r\n[Very happy with 'Explanations']  \r\n","criticality":"minimally critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-06-12T09:42:25.11","progress":"Made change","dateOfPublication":"2020-06-22T12:05:21.99","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Rotherham CCG","count":1},{"name":"Sarah Champion's Office, MP for Rotherham","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/772153","id":"772153"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/772153/responses","id":"772153"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/772153/healthservices","id":"772153"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/772153/tags","id":"772153"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/c87007","id":"C87007","score":3},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frustrated","id":"frustrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/accessible","id":"accessible"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cost%20effective","id":"cost effective"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/efficient","id":"efficient"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kept%20informed","id":"kept informed"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/773304","id":"773304"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/773378","id":"773378"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/773531","id":"773531"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/774715","id":"774715"}]},{"id":773044,"author":"grannie6","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Pre assessment with lovely staff","body":"was made to feel so at ease. had a lovely nurse Kathryn harrower who was lovely and made my visit easy. just feel these ladies and gents should get a wee recognition as well.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-06-19T09:43:32.47","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-06-22T12:20:54.683","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Fife","count":7},{"name":"Fife Health & Social Care Partnership","count":2},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/773044","id":"773044"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/773044/responses","id":"773044"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/773044/healthservices","id":"773044"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/773044/tags","id":"773044"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/f704h_110","id":"F704H_110","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hip%20replacement","id":"hip replacement"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurse","id":"nurse"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20at%20ease","id":"put at ease"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/773533","id":"773533"}]},{"id":773047,"author":"Shibainus","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"MRI Scan today with my favourite music","body":"The staff were amazing and made me feel soooo good and relaxed made a procedure I was so worried about not a procedure at all.

She was examined, very quickly, as the doctor was  busy with another patient, my daughter was a patient too... Doctor had no time to write discharge papers so we have no info for our own \nGP, who might have been able to help her further. I collected my daughter at approx. 9.30pm, brought down to the main entrance by a porter who took over 30 mins to arrive...she had 7 days worth of antibiotics, no pain relief, no advice on what to eat or drink and what must be avoided and no mention of any follow up appointment!!
