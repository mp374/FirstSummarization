[{"id":882019,"author":"BITS","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Why trauma informed practice makes a huge difference","body":"I contacted Eastwood AMHT recently to ask for a duty CPN to call me and I specifically requested a female return my call. The receptionist's response was that it would be whoever was available. I explained I needed a female staff member and that my care plan documents the reasons surrounding my request. I also said the call wasn't of an urgent nature and if there was no female available then it could wait till one was free. The receptionist said this would be passed on. I'd already made five calls including; my GP, NHSGGC, NHS Inform that morning in an attempt to identify a solution and plan to what I was wanting to speak to the CPN about. I fully appreciate and understand the overwhelming pressures the mental health team are working under.hence my trying to find an answer elsewhere. These previous calls had resulted in me ending up in tears and this call only served to further increase my distress.  \r\n  \r\nHowever, I have had similar experiences on multiple occasions with not only the Renfrewshire HSCP but various other healthcare services including NHS24, NHSGGC and worst of all the now obsolete crisis service;which has been replaced by NHS 24 Mental Health Hub and is somewhat of improvement but could still be better.  \r\nI decided to draw this to your attention as I am aware that the HSCP is undertaking TIP training to hopefully become a trauma informed organisation. I have praised and commended this in a previous post on Care Opinion.  \r\nBecoming a trauma informed organisation involves a huge shift in systems, processes and culture which require to be embedded throughout the fabric of the organisation; from the very top level to bottom for it work. It doesn't happen overnight but involves a journey with the leadership of an organisation playing the pivotal role and truly understanding and appreciating the value of working in this way and in fully committing by; enabling, empowering, resourcing and training all staff. In my opinion this most definitely should include reception and call handling staff who are the face and first point of contact for patients. They are so important,and often under appreciated, in setting the tone for all that will happen going forward and in many ways are intrumental in determining whether the patient will have a good or poor experience. Please be reassured the receptionist I spoke with in no way came across in this way and remained polite.  \r\nI am trying to highlight just how very important I believe the role of call handler/receptionist is in setting the tone and making a patient feel listened to, understood and they will try to help in a person-centered way that works for the individual. For people with a history of trauma the most important element in TIP is helping them to feel ‘safe enough’ to engage with services, based on my experiences it is often the small things and paying attention to detail which can be the most helpful. I have lost count of the number of times I have hung up, refused to engage, or have any further contact with a service or professional solely as a result of the way the initial call was handled. Often this has had extremely negative consequences for myself and when just a more understanding and compassionate initial response would have helped me to feel able to engage.  \r\n  \r\nConversley, a recent extremely positive experience I had a main reception staff member at Eastwood. This staff member exemplified how adopting TIP can make such a difference to a patient’s experience. Following a call to another AMHT receptionist, who again remained polite, but didn't seem willing to try to find a solution. I called main reception to ask for assistance to drop of an item for my Consultant. I explained I just can’t enter the health centre due to my fear of being around people and that people wearing masks are triggering for me. I’ve pretty much been a ‘prisoner’ in my own home for the past eighteen months. The staff member used their initiative and went out of her way to help to facilitate this and to find a way around my difficulties. They met me at the far end of the car park, away from the entrance, when I called to say I was outside, came out immediately to save me from waiting around and even had the foresight to ensure their mask was removed. This staff member was so lovely,empathetic,caring and understanding and I wish to thank them for helping me in this way. I don’t know if they realised they were working in a trauma informed way but it was definitely underpinned as such, in the way they interacted,communicated and related to me. Thank you.  \r\n  \r\nIn my previous post I offered to help in any way the HSCP thought may be of beneficial to becoming a trauma informed organisation. I thought this may identify areas which you may want to look at. If you feel it would be helpful I would be more than willing to explain more fully and in greater depth as to how these very different interactions/communications with staff have on people who have experienced trauma and how it makes you feel and how it makes you react.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-09-29T13:59:54.57","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-10-05T09:10:25.757","readBy":[{"name":"NHS 24","count":38},{"name":"East Renfrewshire Health & Social Care Partnership","count":15},{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":6},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2021)","count":2},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2022)","count":1},{"name":"Scottish Recovery Network","count":1},{"name":"Ulster University, MBBS (Medicine) 2021","count":1},{"name":"NHS Education for Scotland","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/882019","id":"882019"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/882019/responses","id":"882019"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/882019/healthservices","id":"882019"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/882019/tags","id":"882019"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/erhscp-community","id":"erhscp-community","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/g602h","id":"G602H","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/nhs24_mhh","id":"NHS24_MHH","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20being%20listened%20to","id":"not being listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/adult%20mental%20health","id":"adult mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ashamed","id":"ashamed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dismissed","id":"dismissed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/distressed","id":"distressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/initiative","id":"initiative"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/patient%20choice","id":"patient choice"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/polite","id":"polite"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/worthless","id":"worthless"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/call%20handling","id":"Call handling"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/person%20centered","id":"person centered"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/trauma%20informed%20practice","id":"trauma informed practice"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/trauma%20awareness","id":"trauma awareness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/overall%20staff%20manner","id":"overall staff manner"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/some%20empathic%20staff","id":"some empathic staff"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/883740","id":"883740"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/884358","id":"884358"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/884530","id":"884530"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/890298","id":"890298"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/891452","id":"891452"}]},{"id":883618,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Disappointed Service User","body":"I have been with Eastglade since.2017 and have had four care coordinators which apparently is normal Eventually I was put in hospital and they discharged me when I was allocated a care coordinator - she told me to ‘ be a man and grow up’  this was not helpful to say the least. She then walked out after 10 minutes telling me that Home treatment would see me but failed to refer me to them. I have since been allocated a care coordinator who is a nice person, sympathetic and understanding but their hands are tied and although they do their best they are limited in what they can do.

In the past care coordinators have not recorded what I told them and just gone with their own thoughts.\nFive times  I have been in hospital  because I have been suicidal and they have put me in the Crisis House and referred me to the Home Treatment Team who discharged me after one visit. Home Treatment is not a good description of this department.  On one occasion when Home Treatment came to see me I was told that ‘ I see people like you all the time you should man up.

The first time I was told there was no heartbeat at 10 weeks pregnant the staff treated me with dignity and respect this is all before covid happened.  \r\nSince covid I feel some staffs attitudes have seemed to of gone down hill. I suffered my third miscarriage through the women’s. I started bleeding and the doctor told me that I wasn’t having a miscarriage and the baby was in place. Then I suffered the miscarriage over the next couple of days.  \r\nThe next miscarriage I wanted to have a d&c to test the foetus for chromosome abnormalities so I had the operation and waited patiently for 2 months on test results. Guess what they failed to tell me they couldn’t get a sample and that there was no test results!  \r\nThis is completely unacceptable it’s a disgrace I wasn’t told any information for 2 whole months! Since then I have become pregnant again and I was incorrectly booked in for a scan date which I had already advised before they booked the scan that I was unavailable for certain dates so again I was not listened to.  \r\nFurther to that a consultant in the emergency department claimed that I am no longer with the miscarriage clinic since my 8 week scan was ok. I feel staff need to think about what they say to patients and give relevant information out instead of causing further anxiety as I am currently still with the miscarriage clinic and even they are unsure why the staff member said that to me.  \r\nI feel like staff do not listen.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-10-04T07:51:52.1233333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-10-05T10:07:45.357","readBy":[{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2022)","count":1},{"name":"Liverpool Women's NHS Foundation Trust","count":1},{"name":"The Miscarriage Association","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/883192","id":"883192"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/883192/responses","id":"883192"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/883192/healthservices","id":"883192"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/883192/tags","id":"883192"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rep01_501","id":"REP01_501","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/angry","id":"angry"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frustrated","id":"frustrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20listened%20to","id":"not listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/should%20listen","id":"Should listen"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bleeding","id":"bleeding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency","id":"emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lost%20test%20results","id":"lost test results"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/miscarriage","id":"miscarriage"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/operation","id":"operation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pregnant","id":"pregnant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scan","id":"scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dignity","id":"Dignity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/previous%20care","id":"previous care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attitudes","id":"staff attitudes"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/883663","id":"883663"}]},{"id":881493,"author":"Gingey","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"My struggle with coping with the pandemic and alcohol and stress related issues","body":"I have been joining online morning groups with Kerry and My Key worker Lee for almost a year now .

I cannot praise the ward enough for the outstanding care and treatment I received. Dr Littlewood did my scan and along with the health care support worker they made me feel so at ease, unfortunately I was found to have a pregnancy with no heartbeat. This is never nice news to deliver or receive but it was done with so much compassion, nothing felt rushed and Dr Littlewood took time in explaining everything she did along the way.  \r\nAfter my scan it was then to discuss treatment options, one of the midwives took time with myself and my partner explaining everything. It was made very clear if at any time once we went home and changed our minds about what option we had chosen that day we could just phone and talk to someone on the ward. We never felt pushed into making a specific treatment decision and felt it was very person centered care.  \r\nA couple of days following I went into the ward for my treatment and was there for over 24 hours. Sorry I can't remember everyone's names but all the healthcare support workers and midwives on shift all did an amazing job. Whenever I needed anything from painkillers to advice it was always on hand.

The Dundee Midwifery unit let me come in and be seen and reassured me all was ok. Then later I had some bleeding and called triage, they asked me to come in, and were very supportive and reassuring. Half way through my observation my little boys heart rate dropped and I was rushed to an emergency C section. The whole staff team were so calm and caring and explained everything that was happening during one of the scariest moments of my life. The head charge nurse even went back out to explain everything to my husband and reassure him.  \r\nThe surgery went well and again the staff kept both me and my husband calm and informed throughout. Unfortunately my son had some complications and wasn’t taking in enough oxygen and was taken to the NICU to get extra help. The team there were amazing also in keeping us reassured that when we couldn’t be with him he was being looked after and held.  \r\nIt was a very hard birth and a very scary moment for us as first time parents. But the entire staff team from when we first arrived at Dundee hospital until we left a few days later were so supportive and wonderful.  \r\nThen after we got gone from hospital we had major issues with breastfeeding, he wouldn’t latch and was screaming in hunger. We received great support from our community midwife and the breast feeding team to try and resolve the issue. Unfortunately nothing seemed to help but the team we supportive to transferring to bottle feeding and provided reassurance and help regarding that and didn’t make me feel like I was a failure or wrong for having to stop breast feeding.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-10-04T14:43:57.17","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-10-05T12:09:43.897","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Tayside","count":10}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/883334","id":"883334"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/883334/responses","id":"883334"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/883334/healthservices","id":"883334"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/883334/tags","id":"883334"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/t101h_501-apn","id":"T101H_501-APN","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/t101h_501-cmu","id":"T101H_501-CMU","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/t101h_501-ls","id":"T101H_501-LS","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/birth","id":"birth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bleeding","id":"bleeding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bottle%20feeding","id":"Bottle feeding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breast%20feeding","id":"breast feeding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/c%20section","id":"c section"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency","id":"emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kind%20staff","id":"kind staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/labour","id":"labour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/maternity","id":"maternity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/midwives","id":"midwives"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/oxygen","id":"oxygen"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pregnancy","id":"pregnancy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/section","id":"section"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/triage","id":"triage"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/well%20informed","id":"well informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/calm","id":"calm"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassuring","id":"reassuring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported","id":"supported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/clear%20explanations","id":"clear explanations"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/well%20supported","id":"well supported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/including%20partner","id":"including partner"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/886174","id":"886174"}]},{"id":883401,"author":"cetustw56","authorRoleId":3,"authorRole":"a parent/guardian","title":"Appointments v's drop ins","body":"I turned up with my 15 year old son for his covid vaccination appointment which was at 17.38 at DW Sports , Unit 54, Kingsgate Shopping Centre, Dunfermline.

The complaints department has been a WASTE of time as all they say is I don't know, I won't know that, and so on.  \r\nPlease do not use coronavirus as a get-out. We have been told the space is there but that they don't have the staff.

She was admitted to ward 9 after a few hours and kept in for 2 days, she was seen by the ENT doctor and had some vessels cauterised before being discharged with antibiotics. I was told to take her straight back to A&E if it happened again.  \r\nThat same night the bleeding started again so back we went to A&E, again we were seen in less than an hour. This time after having bloods taken we were sent to the ENT treatment room, here we were seen by specialist nurse Frank. My Mum was instantly put at ease by his caring attitude and of course a bit of banter. He was extremely thorough and said he'd try his best to make sure she didn't need to be admitted again. We were there for nearly 2 hours while he cleaned and cauterised another vessel and re-packed her nostril. He also gave us some good advice to try and prevent it happening again. After checking her blood work we were good to go, everyone was lovely that we met but special thanks to Frank in the ENT treatment room.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-10-04T21:26:43.79","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-10-05T15:53:19.277","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lanarkshire","count":5},{"name":"Partnership for Change","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/883453","id":"883453"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/883453/responses","id":"883453"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/883453/healthservices","id":"883453"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/883453/tags","id":"883453"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l106h_120","id":"L106H_120","score":5},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l106h_180","id":"L106H_180","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/a&e%20staff","id":"A&E staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/antibiotics","id":"antibiotics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bleeding","id":"bleeding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood","id":"blood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/efficient","id":"efficient"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ent","id":"ent"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurse%20specialist","id":"nurse specialist"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/seen%20quickly","id":"seen quickly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thorough","id":"thorough"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20ease","id":"at ease"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/883989","id":"883989"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/884274","id":"884274"}]},{"id":883449,"author":"Kitty54","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Unexpected trip to ED","body":"My husband had an accident yesterday and cut his finger off!

Free at point of delivery by professional kind people. If anyone truly has an emergency and needs urgent treatment, the Ulster Hospital ED department is the place to go.  \r\nThank you everyone. Your care and genuine desire to help us was so appreciated. Thank you.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-10-04T19:53:08.8933333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-10-05T15:58:25.717","readBy":[{"name":"South Eastern Health and Social Care Trust","count":4},{"name":"Ulster University, MBBS (Medicine) 2021","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/883449","id":"883449"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/883449/responses","id":"883449"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/883449/healthservices","id":"883449"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/883449/tags","id":"883449"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt004_07021_180","id":"ZT004_07021_180","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/accident","id":"accident"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/antibiotics","id":"antibiotics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/artery","id":"artery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ed","id":"ed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency","id":"emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/finger","id":"finger"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/injection","id":"injection"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professional","id":"professional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/prompt","id":"prompt"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/safe","id":"safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tetanus","id":"tetanus"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/calm","id":"calm"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confident","id":"confident"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassuring","id":"reassuring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/relieved","id":"relieved"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thankful","id":"Thankful"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/883977","id":"883977"}]}]
