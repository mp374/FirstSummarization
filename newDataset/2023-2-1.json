[{"id":1018092,"author":"oscaryt66","authorRoleId":4,"authorRole":"a relative","title":"A brilliant service","body":"My mother who is in her nineties fell out of bed last night. She pressed her Careline button and I received a call from West Lothian Careline to notify me of a problem. I attended and found her on the floor. The Careline team asked me to press the button when I was with her to inform them of her condition. The lovely gentleman, Connor, was exceptionally calming and advised he was arranging for the Rapid Response team to come and get her up off the floor - they attended within 20 minutes which was fantastic.  \r\nI noticed this morning that she was in a bit of pain and suffered some bruising. As she suffers from osteoporosis I took the decision to contact the 111 service for advice. I got connected to this service without requiring to wait too long and, again I was greeted by a caring gentleman who asked all the relevant questions and got me transferred to a nurse to discuss further. Everyone I spoke to were professional but also “human” they appreciated that I was worried about my mother’s situation. I was duly advised that I would be contacted by NHS Lothian to advise me where to take her.  \r\nI subsequently attended St John’s Hospital A&E department where the lovely receptionist advised me that my mother was on the “expected list”. After about 5 minutes she was called in to see a nurse/practitioner who examined her and was happy that she hadn’t broken any bones and the minor injuries clinic would provide information on how to manage her pain. After a few minutes we were called again and advised of some exercises and pain relief to take to avoid my mum stiffening up.  \r\nThe whole experience has been exemplary, we have spoken to some dedicated and compassionate staff in a timely manner whom I believe truly cared about my mother. I received a telephone call this afternoon from the Rapid Response team to check on my mother’s condition after the fall - what a brilliant service!","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-01-15T18:30:59.28","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-02-01T08:57:16.027","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lothian","count":11},{"name":"NHS 24","count":13}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1018092","id":"1018092"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1018092/responses","id":"1018092"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1018092/healthservices","id":"1018092"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1018092/tags","id":"1018092"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/nhs24-111","id":"NHS24-111","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/s308h_180","id":"S308H_180","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/a&e","id":"a&e"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bruising","id":"bruising"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dedicated","id":"dedicated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/exemplary%20care","id":"exemplary care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fall","id":"fall"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/great%20service","id":"great service"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nhs111","id":"NHS111"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurse%20practitioner","id":"nurse practitioner"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/osteoporosis","id":"osteoporosis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain%20relief","id":"pain relief"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professional","id":"professional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/quick%20response","id":"quick response"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/receptionist","id":"receptionist"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appreciated","id":"appreciated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassionate","id":"compassionate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fantastic","id":"fantastic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/forever%20grateful","id":"forever grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/injuries","id":"injuries"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1024653","id":"1024653"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1024795","id":"1024795"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1024801","id":"1024801"}]},{"id":1023661,"author":"Bamenda","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Reassuring endoscopy appointment","body":"In January I attended the endoscope department at Gartnavel Hospital.

This was much appreciated and actually allowed me to be an interested spectator of what was happening.  \r\nIrene from the Victoria Hospital Endoscope department had kindly phoned to remind me to stop taking iron tablets which I had previously forgotten to hence this appointment was one which had been quickly rearranged.  \r\nI felt ok after the procures and left the ward but had to return as felt quite groggy.  \r\nThe response was of the same high quality as the rest of the morning : within minutes , I was given ECG etc and was seen twice by Dr Curry who was happy that this was simply the after effects of the sedation.  \r\nMy visit to endoscope was unbelievably pleasant and I feel that I have experienced the NHS at its best in terms of the procedures and the outstandingly caring and friendly personnel who dealt with me.  \r\nIt was all very much appreciated.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-01-30T10:48:54.9433333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-02-01T09:04:50.21","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":5}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1023661","id":"1023661"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1023661/responses","id":"1023661"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1023661/healthservices","id":"1023661"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1023661/tags","id":"1023661"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/gartnaval-general-endo","id":"gartnaval-general-endo","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/caring","id":"caring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctor","id":"doctor"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ecg","id":"ecg"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/endoscopy","id":"Endoscopy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gastroscopy","id":"gastroscopy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/great%20experience","id":"Great experience"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/information","id":"information"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain%20free","id":"pain free"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professional","id":"professional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reception","id":"reception"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendliness","id":"friendliness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/explanations","id":"explanations"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/auxilliaries","id":"auxilliaries"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1024663","id":"1024663"}]},{"id":1024620,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Excellent service ","body":"I arrived at 7.50am with a sprained ankle.

Finchley Memorial hospital is cheerful, clean and bright and has a pharmacy.  It is easy to park there and to register your car at Reception.  My only caution to prospective patients is that you should hold on to your number slip as Reception was very firm indeed about taking people in provable arrival order only.

Coupled to this I have struggled with depression and anxiety which I thought I could manage myself by self medicating with drugs and alcohol, this however couldn't have been further from the truth and over time my addictions spiralled until, shortly after lockdown, I had a major nervous breakdown.  \r\nI spoke to my G.P. and was prescribed anti-depressants and a set of counselling sessions. Both of these treatments helped but it didn't help with my addictions. It was then I was told about Inspire. It became very clear from the first time I entered the building that this was the correct place to be. I never felt like I was being judged in any way and that the staff and volunteers had a wealth of knowledge and compassion to offer.  \r\nI have now completed two support groups, five free accredited courses and I have also applied to become a volunteer myself.  \r\nThe impact that all this help has given me simply cannot be underestimated, its not selling it short to say they have changed my life. I never thought I would be clean and sober but here I am a few months down the line living my new life and thriving.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-01-31T17:43:01.1666667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-02-01T09:16:51.967","readBy":[{"name":"Change Grow Live","count":4},{"name":"Ulster University, MBBS (Medicine) 2021","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1024356","id":"1024356"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1024356/responses","id":"1024356"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1024356/healthservices","id":"1024356"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1024356/tags","id":"1024356"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/nms-inspire-east-lancashire","id":"nms-inspire-east-lancashire","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/alcohol","id":"alcohol"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/alcohol%20abuse","id":"alcohol abuse"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anti%20depressants","id":"anti depressants"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breakdown","id":"breakdown"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20about","id":"Cared about"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/counselling","id":"counselling"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/depression","id":"depression"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/drugs","id":"drugs"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/groups","id":"groups"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/knowledge","id":"knowledge"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/life%20changing","id":"life changing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/non%20judgemental","id":"non judgemental"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/volunteers","id":"volunteers"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassion","id":"compassion"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported","id":"supported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fully%20accepted","id":"fully accepted"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1024770","id":"1024770"}]},{"id":1023641,"author":"K121","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Poor support for disabled people in A & E","body":"I had to attend the Borders General Hospital as an Emergency case via the 999 ambulance service last week. I was cared for in the A&E department for 13hrs  \r\nThe nurses & doctors were amazingly kind & skilled.  \r\nI was given strong painkillers orally which helped a little & made the pain more manageable and I was moved into a resuscitation bay within A&E to be monitored more closely.  \r\nIn normal daily life I am mobility impaired & use crutches & this was clearly recorded in my medical notes plus I had my crutch with me at all times.  \r\nHowever when I needed the toilet and I asked and I was walked , using a crutch , to an ordinary toilet. By the time I got there I was desperate & only realised after I’d gone through the toilet door. As it wasn’t a disabled access toilet there were no handrails or mobility aids to help me.  \r\nThe member of staff had said they would wait outside the toilet door for me but they left. I had no option but to try to use the toilet & cause more pain to my leg, which I didn’t feel at the time because of oral pain relief I was taking . However, days later, I am feeling it now .  \r\nCan I just highlight what happened to make sure it doesn’t happen to another patient . The reason I was attending A&E was for pain & the oral pain relief, which meant I wasn’t as focused and thinking as clearly as normal. It didn’t mean I suddenly wasn’t mobility impaired. It did mean I still required a disabled access toilet and the member of staff should have realised this .  \r\nAs I said, the majority of nurses were amazing but they can’t be in two places at once & other patients were also receiving their wonderful skilled, caring support.  \r\nThe member of staff was aware of my health needs so I don’t know why they treated me this way. It made me feel upset and as if my disability didn’t matter.

I wasnt nervous for the procedure as the letter said most women tolerate it well and I have had a colposcopy with no problems, but I was wrong. Within few minutes I was screaming out in pain. They gave me gas and air and a local injection into my cervix which helped slightly but the pain was way worse than any periods I had ever experienced. I kept saying I'm going to be sick but they carried on and told me it wouldn't take long. I then passed out and came round a few minutes later.  \r\nUpon leaving the department I still had severe cramps and had to sit down and hold my stomach rocking and crying. I just wanted to sit in an air conditioned car as I felt so sick. I really struggled to walk to my car where I was physically sick.

Some that have been very challenging and daunting. As for my care inside Wolfson house carries more stigma from nurses and even the consultants because we are mentally disabled. I personally feel like an alien and that does not only reach out on my behalf.  \r\nI know it must take a lot of time and patients to be a nurse and they do go through a lot of abuse verbally and even physically. To be honest most of what I see going on around does not really break me down or over rule my values but we as mental health service users are still human beings.  \r\nBasically what I am trying to preach to who ever is concerned. This hospital feels like being inside a low secure prison it is a very slow prosses to get a discharge, it is very basic in other words not much going on and the doctor are very set in there ways. Thinking they can walk through metal doors like they are invisible, metaphorically speaking.  \r\nTo be honest we need more money being put in the pot, giving us more opportunities in life for example more education more activities. My biggest issue I would like to share with you that does not make sense. I was once a service user in Northampton St Andrews hospital I was months before being discharged before the funders told me they could not afford to keep me there. But once they brought me back here in London my doctor told me I will be here for a small amount of time. Again lies it took me almost two years before being granted unescorted leave when my funders told me it will be a few months.  \r\nYes I have been in mood swings and yes I have been in about half dozen fights in the whole twenty five years being inside mental institutions but even though my crime was horrific I should have served a fifteen year stretch.  \r\nTo be quite blunt I feel the authorises have pissed all over me and we as mental health service users must be treated like human being because I do know one thing what you most probably already know, in years to come being insane will be a much more common issue simply because life is becoming to much to handle. So please open your eyes towards being mentally troubled because even though you can not see how painful our problems are, trust me it is very painful and destressing.  \r\nThank you for reading my speech.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-01-30T16:06:36.24","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-02-01T10:42:51.38","readBy":[{"name":"East London NHS Foundation Trust","count":12}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1023846","id":"1023846"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1023846/responses","id":"1023846"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1023846/healthservices","id":"1023846"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1023846/tags","id":"1023846"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rwk-712-wh","id":"RWK-712-wh","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/inpatient%20mental%20health","id":"inpatient mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/more%20activities","id":"more activities"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/more%20funding","id":"More funding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/progress","id":"Progress"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/slow%20process","id":"slow process"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20treated","id":"not treated"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1028262","id":"1028262"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1028277","id":"1028277"}]},{"id":1023723,"author":"rhinojj63","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Care and attention","body":"My appointment was with Simon.

The next thing I knew I was sitting on the ground with about 4 people round me - an ambulance was called and came quite soon - taking me to Accident and Emergency at the Norther General.  \r\nThe ambulance crew were great - very professional - getting my details, checking my heart etc and giving me some painkillers - they also kept me talking ... which was friendly but also I suspect a good thing to do with someone who has had concussion. At the hospital I was taken through quickly for an initial assessment and X Rays - followed by a scan of my head. I was there for quite a long time (about 5 or 6 hours) frankly, I didn't mind - staff the nurse and the doctor assigned to me were attentive and helpful - clearly carrying multiple case loads. I am now waiting for the results of an assessment of my case from the Fracture Clinic which I have been told I will get tomorrow.  \r\nMy one criticism of A and E that I would like noting is that they handed the job of fitting me with a sling to a junior member of staff - the correct fitting and explaining why it was important did not happen. In retrospect with a collar bone that is snapped and digging into my skin I think this is important and could have been done better - my only criticism.","criticality":"minimally critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-01-30T19:30:17.66","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-02-01T10:51:24.873","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Sheffield ICB","count":1},{"name":"Yorkshire Ambulance Service NHS Trust","count":1},{"name":"Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust ","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1023909","id":"1023909"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1023909/responses","id":"1023909"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1023909/healthservices","id":"1023909"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1023909/tags","id":"1023909"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rhqng_1001","id":"RHQNG_1001","score":4},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rx8-emergency","id":"RX8-emergency","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/accident","id":"accident"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/accident%20&%20emergency","id":"accident & emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ambulance","id":"ambulance"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ambulance%20crew","id":"ambulance crew"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/assessment","id":"assessment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bicycle","id":"bicycle"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/clavicle","id":"clavicle"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/collarbone","id":"collarbone"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/concussion","id":"concussion"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cycling","id":"cycling"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/efficient","id":"efficient"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency","id":"emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/explanation","id":"explanation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fell","id":"fell"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fracture","id":"fracture"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/head","id":"head"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helpful","id":"helpful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/junior%20doctor","id":"Junior Doctor"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kind","id":"kind"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/knowledgeable","id":"knowledgeable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurse","id":"nurse"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/painkillers","id":"painkillers"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professional","id":"professional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/responsive","id":"responsive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/safe","id":"safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scan","id":"scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/seen%20quickly","id":"seen quickly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/x-rays","id":"x-rays"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported","id":"supported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/advice%20given","id":"advice given"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1024700","id":"1024700"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1043264","id":"1043264"}]},{"id":1023719,"author":"humanitiesfx99","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"They couldn't do enough for me","body":"I cut through my chin, lip and nose with a blade whilst completing DIY.  \r\nUnfortunately I didn’t get anybody's name as I think I was in shock.

After I had cataract surgery I had to start having eye injections at Ayr Hospital. It was after the cataract surgery they said that they weren’t going to see me anymore and couldn’t do anymore for me. But that is when Dr Merchant wanted to see me and got in touch and took it further and I’m still his patient which is great. He said actually, he wants to see me again and that’s when he has organised these injections for me to try and clear a blood clot I have.  \r\nI was absolutely delighted that he went out of his way to see me again and organise more treatment going forward. Dr Merchant is the surgeon in the hospital. I had had injections in Nov and Dec, but I missed my January appointment because I never received the letter I think because of postal strikes. But the hospital called me to see where I was which I think is great. They have booked me in for next injection at the end of next month.  \r\nI was really disappointed to miss my appointment because Dr Merchant is wonderful, but it is great they called me to find out why I didn’t attend.  \r\nDr Abbey did my last two injections in Dr Merchant’s clinic. I would say to anybody don’t be frightened to go for these injections, they are very very good at what they do. The nurses there (one called Michelle and one was Siobhan I think) they were absolutely excellent and they looked after you and made sure you felt comfortable, they are really really good, so don’t be afraid.  \r\nThere’s a nurse you see just before you go in too and they’re all just lovely and really know what they’re doing and very very nice.  \r\nMy problem now is trying to get a patient transport ambulance to take me there, because there’s no way I can go on a bus and I can’t afford a taxi. You have to phone ten days before which is a nightmare for me, and I know they are busy and I appreciate the fact that I get access but I’m anxious about calling to book.

My birth plan that I had originally planned and hoped for did not happen, the exact opposite of what I wanted occurred. However what has given me so much peace and gratitude is the amazing midwife who helped me through my delivery experience.  \r\nI met Claire when I was 7cm dilated and had just received an epidural. I genuinely cannot explain in words how thankful I am for her, but I will try my best. Claire firstly is a breath of fresh air, she is a walking angel who honestly lit up the room when she walked in (metaphorically). She dimmed all the lights, put some music on and just created such a warm and safe environment in what can be a very clinical unfriendly area. Having had an epidural and being in hospital for nearly 30 hours already, I was exhausted and dignity really was out the window. Claire immediately sorted me out making me extremely comfortable and clean. She moved me every couple of hours, checking my position, changing my pads and she just treated me with such respect. She made me feel like a human and empowered again when I just felt so weak and down getting the epidural.  \r\nShe was so professional in everything she done with such a warm personality that let me ask every question under the sun and she answered it openly and honestly. Her standard of care was the best I’ve seen and dealt with throughout all my meetings within maternity.  \r\nShe was so compassionate in every way, she is absolutely someone I would want to take care of me and my family. I felt so so safe with Claire, and she made my experience amazing.

The biopsy being carried out very professionally by Kerry. I received the results which indicated a nodular and infiltrative basal cell carcinoma, and a telephone appointment was made for me. I remained in all day but for some reason the call was not received. This does point to the fact that telephone appointments do sometimes for no apparent reason, have a downside. In my view for those sort of issues, there is nothing like a face to face.  \r\nThis aside a letter was kindly written by Dr Waterfall to Dr McGrath for her help and advice on the matter. I was then given a date to see her in October 2022, and was informed that she would carry out surgery within a couple of months. After a number of unavoidable cancellations, and an agreed change of plan, I finally had the surgery in January 2023, and how lucky I feel that I am to have Dr McGrath and her 2 nursing assistants to carry out the procedure.  \r\nI was kept informed all the way through the procedure, and the surgery was carried out extremely professionally, and with great competence. I consider that our health service is so very lucky to have such a clever and caring member of staff, who instills so much confidence into the patient, and attending nurses who are so dedicated and attentive. Thank you to everybody who attended to me right through from reception to Surgeon.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-01-30T16:57:52.4266667","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2023-02-01T13:56:01.847","readBy":[{"name":"Royal Devon University Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust","count":7}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1023871","id":"1023871"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1023871/responses","id":"1023871"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1023871/healthservices","id":"1023871"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1023871/tags","id":"1023871"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rh880-dermatology","id":"RH880-dermatology","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/biopsy","id":"biopsy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/carcinoma","id":"carcinoma"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dermatology","id":"dermatology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctors","id":"doctors"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/face","id":"face"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fortunate","id":"fortunate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helpful","id":"helpful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kept%20informed","id":"kept informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kind","id":"kind"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nursing%20assistants","id":"Nursing Assistants"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professional","id":"professional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reception","id":"reception"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/respectful","id":"respectful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgeon","id":"surgeon"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/telephone%20appointment","id":"telephone appointment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confident","id":"confident"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/delays","id":"delays"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thanks","id":"thanks"}]},{"id":1023873,"author":"coinkg38","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Respiratory care","body":"I have been quite poorly over the years, with pain in the left kidney, and I am on a high dose of morphine to help, but I was beginning to be pushed from different doctors cos they didn't know what to do next. To top it off I had pneumonia, and found I had copd emphysema, so I'm fed up with being ill.  \r\nI hadn't seen a doctor at the local surgery or hospital since before the pandemic, my respiratory nurses came out and one couldn't hear me breathe out so I went to have an x-ray and they found 2 blood clots. I think I heard the doctor say something about an enlarged heart.  \r\nI was kept in overnight, put on blood thinners and next day I was sent home. I am not well some days, the pain in the left kidney and in my chest is so horrendous I don't know what to do. I'm tired, and fed up with the pain. I'd love to get rid of the kidney, that's giving me pain, and I'd love to breathe again without wheezing and using inhalers.  \r\nOn Friday last week i attended an appointment at Grantham. I give them top marks for looking after me, but I want to feel better. Friday was a good day, today on a pain chart of 1 to 10, this is 8; the kidney pain is bad, my breathing is sporadic, I just want the kidney gone and then I'll be able to cope again.  \r\nMr Simpson is lovely and has helped me over the years but how do you get to see your consultant, you can't see a doctor to get referred. I'd love to be able to see Mr Simpson and tell him how ill I feel, and get him to sort out the kidney, then we could work on the breathy thing.  \r\nMy brother was so worried about me he bought me a mobilty scooter, which is a god send. I have days when I can't move. Today I have a cold hot pain in my left lung, the pain is horrendous, and the pain from the kidney is so bad I don't know what to do. I also have fibromyalgia, so stress makes my body hurt, it then magnifies it and then it strikes other nerves in the body. I want to be able to do stuff, but I can't, I can't even work because i never know what the day is going to be like, sorry about this but I'm fed up with the pain, and not having a life.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-01-30T16:59:20.5233333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-02-01T14:05:14.74","readBy":[{"name":"United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust","count":9}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1023873","id":"1023873"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1023873/responses","id":"1023873"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1023873/healthservices","id":"1023873"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1023873/tags","id":"1023873"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rwdda_340","id":"RWDDA_340","score":3},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rwdlp_340","id":"RWDLP_340","score":4},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood","id":"blood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breathing","id":"breathing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/chest","id":"chest"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/concerned","id":"concerned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/copd","id":"copd"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctor","id":"doctor"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emphysema","id":"emphysema"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fibromyalgia","id":"fibromyalgia"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/heart","id":"heart"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kidney","id":"kidney"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/looked%20after","id":"looked after"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lung","id":"lung"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/morphine","id":"morphine"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pneumonia","id":"pneumonia"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20for","id":"cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/referrals","id":"referrals"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1024792","id":"1024792"}]},{"id":1023874,"author":"KBalou","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Prompt treatment for a broken right wrist","body":":One very recent Thursday lunchtime, I thought I had sprained my wrist badly when I fell on it in the house and phoned local health centre to ask if they could bandage it for me as it was my dominant hand. They said no, that I had to have an x-ray and advised me to call 111. Prompt answer from 111 and had a 3-way conversation incl a nurse. They said they'd phone me back with an appointment for Forth Valley Royal Hospital and 10 mins later did exactly that.......it was for 45 mins later.  \r\nMy son drove me to the 1:30pm appointment. After checking in, I got straight through to x-ray dept, was very soon seen by someone and soon after that was x-rayed. Not long after that I was called back through and shown the crack in my wrist. I was given a splint and sent home with an aftercare leaflet. Everyone I had contact with was very positive and friendly and I was told I'd be contacted within 5 working days to visit orthopedics.  \r\nThe next day, Friday, I had a text from that dept and a letter arrived the following day, Saturday, telling me an orthopedic surgeon had looked at my x-ray and deemed a plaster cast appropriate - appointment on the Monday morning.  \r\nAgain I found staff to be very friendly and caring and Claire plastered my arm (with the colour of my choice!), assisted by Magda. After it dried I saw the nurse who checked me over and gave me an appointment 4 weeks thence.  \r\nI feel very privileged to have been given such a thorough, efficient, all-round experience.

He does not understand new systems of working or online stuff in general. Hanging on the phone for 1 hour and 40 minutes means he’s given up making an appointment. Last week the nurse phoned to tell him his cardi gram was ok but his BP readings were high. There was no reference to the sleep study he’s been promised no letter has been sent.  \r\nHe can’t take his tablets for high blood pressure they make him itch day and night.  \r\nHe needs different tablets but not beta blockers . He has mental health issues as he sleeps from 10 pm til 10:30 am. It takes him 2 hours to get going, wash and dress and he’s slowly losing his independence.  \r\nHow can he engage with the service when all you offer is at 8:00am to get on the phone or come to the surgery?  \r\nThen he could be sent away to have to come back. So immediately he’s given up.  \r\nThere are other people like him as I work with special needs so what provisions are there at your practice to give disabled people and those with mental health a chance?","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-01-30T17:57:17.6466667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-02-01T14:19:28.903","readBy":[{"name":"East London NHS Foundation Trust","count":9}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1023883","id":"1023883"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1023883/responses","id":"1023883"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1023883/healthservices","id":"1023883"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1023883/tags","id":"1023883"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/e81030","id":"E81030","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frustrated","id":"frustrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/access%20to%20services","id":"access to services"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20pressure","id":"blood pressure"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/booking%20system","id":"booking system"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/flexibility","id":"flexibility"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gp%20surgery","id":"gp surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/head%20injury","id":"head injury"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unhappy","id":"unhappy"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1029884","id":"1029884"}]},{"id":1023886,"author":"pelicanxe86","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Long wait","body":"Far too long a wait in A&E for my aunt.
