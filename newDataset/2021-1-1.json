Have a great new year and keep up the good work.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-12-31T21:15:51.23","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-01-01T10:38:53.397","readBy":[{"name":"Scottish Ambulance Service","count":6},{"name":"NHS Forth Valley","count":10},{"name":"Office of Angus MacDonald, MSP for Falkirk East","count":1},{"name":"Golden Jubilee National Hospital","count":2},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/813761","id":"813761"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/813761/responses","id":"813761"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/813761/healthservices","id":"813761"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/813761/tags","id":"813761"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/d102h_172","id":"D102H_172","score":5},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/forth-valley-royal-cardiology","id":"forth-valley-royal-cardiology","score":5},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/scot-ambulance","id":"scot-ambulance","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cardiology","id":"cardiology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good","id":"good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/heart","id":"heart"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helped","id":"helped"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hospital%20staff","id":"Hospital staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/paramedics","id":"paramedics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/procedure","id":"procedure"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/recovery","id":"recovery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/815590","id":"815590"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/815938","id":"815938"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/819593","id":"819593"}]},{"id":813705,"author":"Rainbow23","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Birth of our 4th baby","body":"Our son was born on 9th December at Royal Victoria Maternity hospital.  \r\nI tried to ring admissions before we came to the hospital but couldn’t get anyone on the phone so I went on up to the hospital and arrived around 8pm  \r\nBoth the midwife (can’t remember her name) and the doctor (Angelo) were both great and arranged for me to be admitted to Ward A around 11.30pm on 8th December. While I wasn’t technically in labour (was having contractions but cervix was closed) they were concerned as I had been bleeding heavily (I had a haemorrhage following the birth of baby number 3 so this put me in the at risk category).  \r\nWhile in ward A the staff there were great again, the midwife was very helpful. I continued having contractions which increased in intensity. Asked for gas & air around 1.30am - 2am but was told I should try other pain relief such as co-codamol (which I accepted but didn’t make a difference). I then called the same midwife around 3am to say my contractions were very intense, midwife checked me and said I was 3-4cm. She said I could have a bath or go to delivery room. I knew the labour was progressing very fast even though the midwife didn’t seem to think so, I said I wanted to go to the delivery room. At 3.30am they said I could go round to delivery room so they told me to call my husband to come up to the hospital. I then packed up my stuff (with the help of the midwife and other nursing staff) and I walked round to the delivery room at 3.40am and was handed over to another midwife. Baby was born at 4.12am...luckily my husband got there just in time. The midwife even remarked that the baby had come a lot quicker than she expected.  \r\nI can’t recommend the staff highly enough as I think they were all very helpful especially as I was very anxious about the possibility of another haemorrhage (which thankfully didn’t happen). My husband was allowed to stay for as long as he wanted (he had to go home just before 8am to get our older kids to school). Very thorough and I couldn’t have asked for a better midwife.  \r\nI was transferred to Johnstone house (to keep an eye on me for a few hours to ensure no haemorrhage). Again the staff there and the midwife were amazing. I was discharged around 6pm that same day. Johnstone house is great and I felt like I was in a hotel!  \r\nTo summarise I think all the staff were amazing especially working under the covid restrictions. I did wear my face mask most of the time until I got to the delivery room. Only thing that I wasn’t happy with, was that I wasn’t able to speak to anyone in admissions before I came up to the hospital but I assume the staff were overwhelmed with patients at that time.","criticality":"minimally critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-12-31T16:13:34.1433333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-01-01T10:49:36.233","readBy":[{"name":"Belfast Health and Social Care Trust","count":9}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/813705","id":"813705"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/813705/responses","id":"813705"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/813705/healthservices","id":"813705"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/813705/tags","id":"813705"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt001-rgh-admissions","id":"zt001-rgh-admissions","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt001-rgh-antenatal-ward","id":"zt001-rgh-antenatal-ward","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt001-rgh-delivery-suite","id":"zt001-rgh-delivery-suite","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt001-rgh-postnatal","id":"zt001-rgh-postnatal","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxious","id":"anxious"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/admissions","id":"admissions"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/birth","id":"birth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bleeding","id":"bleeding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cervix","id":"cervix"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/contractions","id":"contractions"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/delivery","id":"delivery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctor","id":"doctor"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gas%20and%20air","id":"gas and air"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/haemorrhage","id":"haemorrhage"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helpful","id":"helpful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/labour","id":"labour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/maternity","id":"maternity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/midwives","id":"midwives"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain%20relief","id":"pain relief"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/visiting","id":"visiting"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ward%20staff","id":"ward staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happy","id":"happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/contactable","id":"contactable"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/814609","id":"814609"}]},{"id":813736,"author":"VampireFriend","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Marvellous people and reasons to celebrate","body":"Venesection at FVR Day Medicine Unit ~ Venesection Suite.  \r\nVenesection no.6, I intended to post a photo of the treatment site.

However, from testing through to treatment I could not have asked for anything more from the caring team. This includes admin, nurses, HCA's, Dr's, Macmillan nurse support and everyone else in the background. I felt totally in safe hands and felt genuinely cared for by the magnificent team. Obviously I was anxious and scared but once in the hospital for my operation the support was excellent and they helped alleviate all fears. When I had an issue with a wound on the ward the Dr was contacted and came to see me as soon as he was out of surgery. The team obviously respect and care about each other and this has created a brilliant working environment for them and great patient experience. Your student nurse is going to be fantastic. Only two slight negatives, lack of phone reception meant contact with family especially during covid stressful but the staff helped and offered options where they could. This is totally out of their hands. The second item was the food, this was like a time warp and not pleasant. However, don't let this detract from the excellent experience I had at the hospital. Thank you so much, I am now celebrating the New Year after a phone call to say I am cancer free. Happy New Year to our NHS Heroes who are working tirelessly through out the country.

Your patience and kindness whilst working under the current very stressful situation is nothing short of heroic!\n\nJust thank you a million times.\n","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2021-01-01T14:55:08","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2021-01-01T15:29:33","readBy":[{"name":"Somerset NHS Foundation Trust","count":2}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/813870","id":"813870"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/813870/responses","id":"813870"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/813870/healthservices","id":"813870"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/813870/tags","id":"813870"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rh5a8","id":"RH5A8","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/brilliant","id":"brilliant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good","id":"good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/important","id":"important"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/physio","id":"physio"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appreciated","id":"appreciated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported","id":"supported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"}]},{"id":813868,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"great service","body":"having an infusion  of zoledronic acid for the first time the staff were very reassuring and kind which helped me to be relaxed  and i cant praise them enough for their understanding ","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2021-01-01T15:12:10","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-01-01T15:29:43","readBy":[{"name":"East Kent Hospitals University NHS Foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/813868","id":"813868"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/813868/responses","id":"813868"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/813868/healthservices","id":"813868"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/813868/tags","id":"813868"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rvv","id":"RVV","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/acid","id":"acid"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helped","id":"helped"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/relaxed","id":"relaxed"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/816393","id":"816393"}]},{"id":813869,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Amazing Service From Start to Finish","body":"I am writing to say what amazing service we have had from Addenbrooke's.

Many thanks.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2021-01-01T13:04:59","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-01-01T19:37:06","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/813884","id":"813884"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/813884/responses","id":"813884"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/813884/healthservices","id":"813884"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/813884/tags","id":"813884"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rxh09","id":"RXH09","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/operation","id":"operation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appreciated","id":"appreciated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thanks","id":"thanks"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/826365","id":"826365"}]},{"id":813889,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Concerning lack of communication and…","body":"My mother has been at this hospital since 19th December. Currently still in as she contracted covid at the hospital. When calling to get update and to arrange a zoom call with mum we are finding that it’s always an inconvenience and staff are being rude with us. We try asking for a time for us to call tobest suit them but consistently we are told to call\nBack in an hour. Also considering mum is on a covid Ward it’s highly concerning that when I go to collect her washing after 4 dats I get only one pair of pyjamas and two underwear garments. Doesn’t seem infection control is high on their priority list?  Staff sigh on the phone when asked about how mum is doing and say. We have other patients to look after.  Is it asking too much to get one daily update on how mums progress is going? I myself am a health care worker and am shocked an concerned at the lack of communication, empathy and understanding they show. Mum looks utterly depressed. She has lung cancer and has been in hospital since 10th Dec and is missing us her family.  I understand and appreciate the strains and pressure they are undergoing as I myself feel those too in my career. But it is absolutely NO excuse for them to lower their duty of care standards. We feel highly worried concerned and utterly unsupported by the covid Ward at this hospital.  Maybe them not coming into contact with families is making them care less about the ripple effect this is spreading heart break and stress to loved ones of patients there?

Since then the virtual visits have been arranged by a non nursing team, such a gift for the families and the already pressurised nursing team.  \r\nThe virtual visit team are so efficient, empathetic and lovely to speak to. Visits can be arranged that day and can also be booked several days in advance. Visits always happen at the scheduled time. Sincere thanks to all of you. Being able to speak to and see mum is a real gift at this very difficult time.  \r\nKeep up the great work. God bless.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-01-02T10:09:12.8466667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-01-02T11:36:29.987","readBy":[{"name":"Southern Health and Social Care Trust","count":5},{"name":"Public Health Agency","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/813927","id":"813927"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/813927/responses","id":"813927"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/813927/healthservices","id":"813927"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/813927/tags","id":"813927"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_33020","id":"ZT003_33020","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003-vv","id":"zt003-vv","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/efficient","id":"efficient"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lovely","id":"lovely"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/empathetic","id":"empathetic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/virtual%20visiting","id":"virtual visiting"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/814366","id":"814366"}]},{"id":813929,"author":"Caroil","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Skin lesions removed","body":"I attended the Dermatology Department at Stirling Community Hospital to have two skin lesions surgically removed by David and Lesley.

They greeted me warmly, explained the procedure, made sure I was comfortable and kept me relaxed.  \r\nThe surgeries were carried out most professionally with particular attention to cleanliness, keeping the sites sterile, surgical skill and with full Covid 19 protection - all of this without any fuss but with humour and compassion. They were also able to chat and amuse me to make the procedure and time pass easily.  \r\nWithout doubt, David and Lesley are the A Team of Dermatology Minor Ops and I was so fortunate to be under their care again. I had total confidence in them to do an excellent job and knew I was in safe hands.  \r\nLesley also gave me samples of various creams to try out to improve my eczema. She kindly gave me advice about their use and how to obtain them by prescription.  \r\nI must also acknowledge the parts played by Dr Craig, nurse Brenda Smith and Alanna the receptionist.

I called NHS 24 I was aware that the service demand was high and eventually after. 1 hour and 30 minutes I got through.  \r\nI spoke to a call handler called David (I think was his name) he was very supportive and listened to the information I was giving him. He went through all the appropriate questions and he spoke to one of the other clinicians for me who was also very kind. I was told I would wait up to 4 hours for someone to call back but after 15 minutes a doctor had phoned and discussed things with me.  \r\nThe doctor was really nice she listened and was very thorough. I do have endometriosis so have been in this difficult situation before and NHS 24 and the hospital have had to help me in the past. The doctor did suggest some things we could try and then she asked me “what has helped you in the past when this has happened? ” and I had told her and she agreed that this was a suitable plan. She arranged for me to be seen at the Western General Hospital.  \r\nThe clinician I seen (unsure if she was a doctor or a nurse) she was very good. She listened to me and did all the appropriate checks before agreeing that we could go down the intramuscular injection route and see how I got on with that. Once she had done that she gave advice about what to do if I found it didn’t work and told me to call straight back. She was very understanding which really did help especially at a time I was struggling.

Everything was explained to me clearly and even after the compulsory doom laden warnings of what may happen these were followed by clear and concise statements of what each of the team were doing during the angiogram procedures. I found this an enormous reassurance and a sense of real professionalism and real care towards me as the patient. Each individual had their own specialist responsibilities and the communication between them was testament to highly honed teamwork.
