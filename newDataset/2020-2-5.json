Her throat was very swollen, and painkillers weren't making any difference. As she lives in Glasgow and I live in Perth, it made the situation very worrying. She was seen by a lovely out of hours doctor in the Royal Alexandra Hospital who acted quickly and referred her to ward 11b at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital, Glasgow. We had a bit of a panic, because it wasn't clear where to go at the QEUH out of hours, before my daughter figured out she could get in via A&E, so some added distress could have been avoided with clearer instructions. I had left Perth at this point - 1:30 am - and I was shown to the lifts by a really helpful A&E receptionist at QEUH. By the time I arrived at ward 11b, she'd had a peritonsillar abscess drained (quinsy) by an incredibly kind doctor who had given her a hug - as a mum that gave me great comfort - and was tucked up in bed on IV fluids and antibiotics. The night shift nurses were lovely, very concerned and attentive, checking my daughter's pain levels.  \r\nThe consultant arrived in the morning and was really approachable, he made it easy to ask questions about the next steps.  \r\nThe day shift staff were great, offering much kindness and care.  \r\nI was really grateful, right from the diagnosis to all of her treatment and I wanted to share our experience. I hope the staff will hear about how much of a difference their kindness and care really made to us.","criticality":"minimally critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-02-04T09:53:20.4666667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-02-05T09:07:23.137","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":15},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/739197","id":"739197"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/739197/responses","id":"739197"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/739197/healthservices","id":"739197"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/739197/tags","id":"739197"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/c418h-gp-out-of-hours","id":"c418h-gp-out-of-hours","score":5},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sj9qe-120","id":"sj9qe-120","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/abscess","id":"abscess"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/antibiotics","id":"antibiotics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diagnosis","id":"diagnosis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/directions","id":"Directions"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fluids","id":"fluids"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/information","id":"information"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kindness","id":"kindness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain%20management%20information","id":"pain management information"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/painkillers","id":"painkillers"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/quinsy","id":"quinsy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/referral","id":"referral"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/throat","id":"throat"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tonsillitis","id":"tonsillitis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20concerned","id":"very concerned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassion","id":"compassion"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/access%20instructions","id":"access instructions"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/739737","id":"739737"}]},{"id":739428,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Too many patients not enough GP’s!","body":"This morning I was due an appointment that I’d waited 3 weeks for, an hour before it was cancelled, no apology or reasons as to why?

On the whole an excellent department and physiotherapist.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-02-04T19:29:15","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-02-05T09:19:44","readBy":[{"name":"Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS Trust","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/739429","id":"739429"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/739429/responses","id":"739429"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/739429/healthservices","id":"739429"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/739429/tags","id":"739429"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rw602","id":"RW602","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stress","id":"stress"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/exercise","id":"exercise"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/incontinence","id":"incontinence"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pelvic","id":"pelvic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/physio","id":"physio"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stress%20incontinence","id":"stress incontinence"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/feel%20at%20ease","id":"feel at ease"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20ease","id":"at ease"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/742125","id":"742125"}]},{"id":739433,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Worse practice ever!","body":"This place is absolutely diabolical.

She did not ask any questions to triage the degree of urgency in this case.\nInstead, it was suggested to visit the Walk-in centre or call 111.\nI have been a registered patient at this practice for 8 years with immaculate attendance history.  \nThe receptionist's actions were negligent, unprofessional and overall poor.   \nI am a dentist myself and had to take time off work, just to face this.

They found a live ectopic in my right Fallopian Tube and I was rushed by Ambulance to Wishaw. In my arrival to triage in a wheelchair the paramedics done a handover and I felt that all of the staff just stared at me blankly even when I was visibly anxious and upset and I was made to sit in a waiting room for over an hour around pregnant women, some in labour, which was very upsetting for me as my baby was obviously going to be removed from me. My partner didn't know where I was and I had no phone battery so I asked to contact my mum on the phone at nurses station, again I felt like I was stared at blankly and told they were busy and they would let me know. Eventually my partner found me followed by my mum and step-dad. We sat for another long time before I became very concerned and upset and my mum pushed for them to give me a bed as this was an emergency. They said that they couldn't go by the private scan report and that it wasn't an emergency as I had no symptoms (I felt as if they were waiting on me rupturing before they would help me). I was then told by a member of staff not to listen to people when they say ectopic as it might not be and not to worry yet. I explained that I have seen the baby in the scan in the tube and they stated that they hadn't even read the report and went to go read it. I then announced that I was a staff member and that was when the staff became much kinder to me and I was taken more seriously. Eventually the lovely consultant came to see me after the report was read and I was given another scan, which proved what I already knew and then emergency Laparoscopy with right salpingectomy. I just hope that a similar thing doesn't happen to someone else as it was a terrifying experience and I could have ruptured and died all because they didn't bother to read the report as it was a private scan, even though I had bleeding and previous reccurent miscarriages increasing my risks. I understand the need to re-scan me and to do further tests, but the fact is I was brought in with a query ectopic and that should have been enough to indicate the need for urgent medical assessment and a bit of more respect and kindness towards me considering I was alone and petrified.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-02-03T00:55:45.0933333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-02-05T11:02:13.073","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lanarkshire","count":7},{"name":"Partnership for Change","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/738829","id":"738829"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/738829/responses","id":"738829"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/738829/healthservices","id":"738829"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/738829/tags","id":"738829"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l308h_501","id":"L308H_501","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxious","id":"anxious"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/should%20listen","id":"Should listen"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20upset","id":"very upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/alone","id":"alone"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bleeding","id":"bleeding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/concerned","id":"concerned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/consultant","id":"consultant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disregarded","id":"disregarded"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ectopic","id":"ectopic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ectopic%20pregnancy","id":"ectopic pregnancy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency","id":"emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/laparoscopy","id":"laparoscopy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medical%20assessment","id":"medical assessment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20taken%20seriously","id":"not taken seriously"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pregnancy","id":"pregnancy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/triage","id":"triage"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/expect%20better%20care","id":"Expect better care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/transvaginal%20ultrasound%20scan","id":"transvaginal ultrasound scan"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/739855","id":"739855"}]},{"id":739501,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Calling reception","body":"On Monday I made in excess of 80 phone call to surgery continuously.

Every time I come I wait around an hour to be seen (appointment) for a minute. If I wait one hour each time, it is a pattern showing a normalised dysfunction.  \r\nThe receptionist gave me the most idiotic excuses ever.  \r\nFirstly I was told that it is a free care clinic.  \r\nWhat I am hearing is that if something is free it has to be inefficient by default. Of course, it it not free NHS care. I pay very high taxes for the NHS. I do not receive free care. It is paid for.  \r\nThe second excuse was that ”everywhere is like this”. A very _poor_ excuse not to be better organised.  \r\nLet us keep our definitions clean. A 10am appointment, for example, means that the client is seen at 10am, not 11am. If you have a policy of seeing clients within an hour, do not call it an appointment, and also why are you _unable_ to have a standard-basic on time appointments.

I have noted the rudeness of staff on reception and inconsistency of information provided in general. However, l am writing this review to highlight how ineffective the service provided here is. l went into the surgery on the 28 January to bring in a letter from my sons hospital appointment stating his medication should be increased, the letter was a copy as the hospital doctor had faxed the same letter over that day at the same time I requested a repeat \nprescription for myself as information in the surgery state repeat prescriptions turnaround time is 72 hours l thought l would get my prescription by the Friday/Saturday. Needless to say l had to return to the surgery on Monday 3/2/20 as the chemist was not faxed my repeat prescription and was told it was faxed to the chemist on the 2/2/20 - which is over the 72 hours timelime and that she could not advise about my sons prescription. I collected my medication yesterday and am will waiting for my sons prescription which is extremely important due to his illness and the fact that the medication was increased. l called the surgery this morning  to find out what is happening and advise if the importance that my son gets his medication, that l had bought in a copy of the hospital letter over a week ago and that as my sons medication is running out. l advised l will come in and collect the prescription to be to!d by the receptionist l just call before l come to the surgery she is trying to help me and will not continue to help as o am talking to her in 'a tone'.  There was no acknowledgement that that she had listened to what l had told her that the medication was running out, that the hospital had increased my sons medication from the 28/1/20 and that l had bought in a copy of the hospital the same day over a week ago and nothing had been done to date, no the receptionist seemed to feel the service being provided was fine. Words fail me as to the customer service being provided at this surgery . I will be reporting this experience my sons  hospital doctor today so he can request that this is looked into.

From my first meeting with Sharon at my booking appointment I felt at ease and having a number to contact her directly on was great, I was able to text her to check things and knowing that she knew me made all the difference, I felt comfortable messaging or speaking to her in appointments about anything! It was lovely seeing the same person for every appointment and build a relationship, especially with something like a pregnancy. Also being offered accupuncture and aromatherapy was a lovely addition to the service which i loved!  \r\nWhen it came to my actual delivery unfortunately Sharon wasn't available however Elizabeth and Lorna (also blue team) were amazing during my very quick water birth, they both kept me calm and my aftercare from them was amazing. Sharon heard about my sons arrival whilst away as she kept checking with her team as she knew I was overdue so sent me her congratulations as soon as she was back in work.

I thought unwise to verbally mock the area which those in the waiting area reside but it was just me on the waiting area once and the next time elderly patients.  \r\nAlthough it is only one particular receptionist the other are polite but will still band together against any comment on the behaviour. I do not feel able to approach management with any positive outcome because of their friednly relationship with the reception desk.  \r\nFor months i have watched as a passive observer with others experiencing it but my kids went with their dads for an appointment and tried to explain the kids had access online (from previous practice) rather than say its individual rules that the practice has made to not allow under 16s. They decide to tell him he was wrong and they didn't want to see proof he had that they had it previously as he was wrong.  \r\nHe said he will ask the doctor and the response was why i deal with it and the doctor will not know better than me. It is the way the receptionist says things and the tone that completely come off wrong. Everyone knows it but nobody addresses it. Unless you experience it you would not believe it.  \r\nI called up after to make an appointment to speak to someone in charge and was told they were on annual leave, the other reception went to the length to down play the interaction. Other receptionist told me that they looked it up and although their dad was right each practice makes its own version of patient access. Now was that hard i dont believe so - this should have been done at the beginning not told he was wrong it never happens when he has it on his phone it front of their face. People are not expected to know everything but when you act like you do, this happens.  \r\nThe GPs in this practice i must say are brilliant i have went from strength to strength with their assistance.  \r\nBased on previous interactions i am not impressed this person's attitude to the community they serve.  \r\nI know people sitting in older adults who where shocked about the situation. My son is a quiet boy and found it an uncomfortable experience. Their Dad who has never said a cross word came out fuming and embarrassed after being calmed and advised by the gp on how to deal with situation through the correct channels .  \r\nYou can have opinions about an area and i believe this person is from said area but in a professional capacity you should have the customer service face on and admit when you dont know something. This particular interaction could have been solved by taking the phone number and getting back to me about patient access. I wish it was simple to correct but it seems its lack of professional values at heart.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-02-03T12:16:01.5266667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-02-05T11:34:20.507","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":7}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/738928","id":"738928"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/738928/responses","id":"738928"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/738928/healthservices","id":"738928"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/738928/tags","id":"738928"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sj9-general-practices","id":"sj9-general-practices","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/embarrassed","id":"embarrassed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/shocked","id":"shocked"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appointment%20system","id":"appointment system"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctors","id":"doctors"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/receptionist","id":"receptionist"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attitude","id":"staff attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/uncomfortable","id":"uncomfortable"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/739772","id":"739772"}]},{"id":739010,"author":"Danmz93","authorRoleId":8,"authorRole":"a staff member posting for a patient/service user","title":"An asset to any team that saves addicts lives","body":"Very briefly!

I was given a prescription for antibiotics and my wife asked at the reception desks whether they knew of a 24 hour chemist (it was close to midnight at that stage). The hospital does not have a 24 pharmacy on site and the staff on reception could not advise of a 24 hour pharmacy local to the hospital. They gave us a sheet with local pharmacies and their opening times...but that did not address the question of a pharmacy open at that time of night. Calling 111 did not help either and in the end I took the decision to wait until 9am the following morning when my wife was able to go to a pharmacy to get my prescription.  \r\nI was fortunate that I was already on some prescribed medication following the operation. I am not sure what I would have done if I had not been in that position and not being able to get my prescribed medication from my A&E visit.","criticality":"minimally critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-02-04T13:07:09.6133333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-02-05T12:48:58.74","readBy":[{"name":"London North West University Healthcare NHS Trust","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/739232","id":"739232"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/739232/responses","id":"739232"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/739232/healthservices","id":"739232"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/739232/tags","id":"739232"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/r1k01_180","id":"R1K01_180","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/antibiotics","id":"antibiotics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/efficient","id":"efficient"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fortunate","id":"fortunate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/high%20temperature","id":"high temperature"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/knowledge","id":"knowledge"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pharmacy","id":"Pharmacy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pharmacy%20services","id":"pharmacy services"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/resource","id":"resource"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/temperature","id":"temperature"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/triage","id":"triage"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/clear%20solutions","id":"clear solutions"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/739773","id":"739773"}]},{"id":739238,"author":"DPR","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Myself and connect3 at Sheffield Mind","body":"I was in a very dark place but since beginning with Terence at connect-3 I have  \r\n*Stopped drinking Alcohol completely  \r\n*Seen my GP on a regular basis  \r\n*Applied for PIP  \r\n*Felt more confident about in the community  \r\n*Positive about my future","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-02-04T13:27:54.78","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-02-05T12:50:05.643","readBy":[{"name":"South Yorkshire Housing Association","count":2},{"name":"NHS Sheffield ICB","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/739238","id":"739238"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/739238/responses","id":"739238"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/739238/healthservices","id":"739238"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/739238/tags","id":"739238"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/1-101660555-connect3","id":"1-101660555-connect3","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/alcohol","id":"alcohol"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/drinking","id":"drinking"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/help","id":"help"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/key%20worker","id":"key worker"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/safe","id":"safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/understood","id":"understood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/service","id":"service"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/740288","id":"740288"}]}]
