We were told by his specialist nurse to go to Northwick Park A&E and tell the staff to contact his consultant.  We arrived at 3pm and sat for 4 hours in a packed A&E waiting room while my son was in continuous pain.  The reception staff were rude and uncommunicative, ignoring my request to contact my son's consultant and telling us to tell the nurse when we saw her, which wasn't for hours.  A sign on the wall said that capacity for the waiting room was 30 but there were at least 50+ people in there.  No social distancing and many people were not wearing masks.  Nobody challenged them on this, despite security staff being ever-present.  A child came in with his father, who told the staff 'he has started coughing and won't stop'.  The child was running round the waiting room coughing, with no face covering.  Nobody stopped him.  We felt unsafe and uncared for.  Eventually we were put in a small room with 4 other people - a man throwing up, a woman shouting and another woman coughing.  Again, no masks, so we went to stand in the corridor and were told we couldn't. I kept trying to tell the staff that all we needed was for them to phone our consultant but I was ignored. It was so worrying.  At 10pm we finally saw a doctor who understood what was going on.  It was such a relief.   We completely understand the pressures that the staff were under but we didn't feel safe there.  A memo went round to all staff during our stay, it told them that Covid cases were rapidly rising.  Having spent all that time in A&E I'm not suprised!   The whole place was dirty and no measures were put in place to make people wear masks and socially distance.  The only people who got any attention during our time there were a drunk woman and a homeless man - they had security and nurses following them around the corridors while they roamed about, again without masks.  If my son had not been in so much pain I would have left and tried our luck in another hospital.  Northwick Park A&E is not fit for purpose.  It badly lets down our amazing NHS.

You then had to change the appointment to the 25th. I made arrangements. I received a call five days before I was due to be seen telling me the appointment has to be changed again. Unfortunately I’m away at the end of August and September I’m due to begin a uni placement, of which Mondays are a crucial day and nearly impossible to get off, especially since I’ve been called to jury service that month and had to have special allowances made already. You provisionally booked me for a Monday in September advising that if I do need to change it (which I’m 99% sure I will) then I could get in touch. I just received the confirmation letter saying that I was the one who cancelled my appointment for the 25th and that if I do it again I’ll be reviewed and passed back to my GP to be re referred. I find this incredibly upsetting and unfair, given that I made every effort to be available for the first two appointment dates. I’m likely to not get seen for a long time, if at all. Since a problem was found in May I’ve been really nervous and eager to get it checked out, and I now feel totally hopeless. I don’t blame the appointments staff for this series of unfortunate events, and as I work in healthcare I understand how things can go wrong with the clinic sometimes. But with the notice you were able to give me, surely a locum could have been arranged? Really really disappointing service.

Silly me; and there was I thinking it was the doctor's job to work out what was wrong with me.\n\n","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2021-07-25T18:36:47","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-07-26T08:24:56","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/865643","id":"865643"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/865643/responses","id":"865643"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/865643/healthservices","id":"865643"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/865643/tags","id":"865643"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/g82225","id":"G82225","score":null},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/881395","id":"881395"}]},{"id":865644,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Concerned patient","body":"The worst GP surgery I have ever visited all the staff and doctors are unprofessional and do not show any care towards patients repeat prescriptions are always a battle to get and require numerous phone calls and emails appointments are impossible to get and if you do get an appointment the doctor just wants you in and out as quickly as possible I will be moving GP shortly as there is no sign of Lime Square getting any better there must be an audit organisation that can assess and close down \n","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2021-07-25T19:12:12","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-07-26T08:25:03","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/865644","id":"865644"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/865644/responses","id":"865644"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/865644/healthservices","id":"865644"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/865644/tags","id":"865644"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/p84059","id":"P84059","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1019534","id":"1019534"}]},{"id":865656,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Care with kindness","body":"I attended the pre-operative swabbing clinic.

I didn’t realise what it was at first, as I didn’t have any of the listed symptoms at the time and there wasn’t any community testing available, so I didn’t isolate from my family. By the time I deteriorated with breathing problems and chest pain, it was too late - I had passed it on to my family.  \r\nMy husband, also 39, had an increase in his usual seasonal allergy symptoms and shortness of breath (SOB). My daughter, who was 7 at the time, had SOB and chest pain, a sore throat and sore eyes. My little boy, who was 5 at the time, was very ill for around 6 weeks – awful cough that made him vomit, fever, skin rashes, sore eyes, sore throat with inability to swallow, change of taste and heightened smell, shortness of breath, increased heartrate, and vomiting & diarrhoea.  \r\nMy daughter initially recovered but a couple of months later was having chest pains and SOB again as well as an increased heartrate, a bloody nose, increased allergies, eye floaters, burst blood vessels in her eyes, lightburn and visual disturbances. The GP diagnosed her as asthmatic over the phone without seeing her or any tests and prescribed inhalers. I mentioned covid but insisted it was just coincidence. The optician said she now has a exposed sclera – the blue bit behind the white of the eye. She also has bulging new veins all over her body and spider veins on her face.  \r\nMy son has seen some symptoms disappear but new ones appear. His cough finally went after 3 months, but he was left with a feeling of not being able to swallow for a further 5 months and still has regular swollen glands. He has the most horrific nosebleeds with blood gushing from nose. His skin rashes stopped, but the eye problems continue – burst blood vessels, blurred vision and deterioration in previously perfect vision with a new prescription for short sightedness. He is also left with a sensitive stomach and his taste has changed along with a heightened smell. He also has joint pain in his knees and he says, my head doesn’t feel right or there’s something missing. He also has bulging veins all over his body.  \r\nGetting medical help for me was difficult; for them, almost impossible.  \r\nThey fell ill in April 2020 and we finally accessed an in-person physical check-up and blood tests in September. The GP admitted they looked unwell and noted the veins but still said, blood tests are not pleasant for children and are very invasive, are you sure? It made my husband and I feel we were overreacting, it was awful. Torn between getting medical help for our children and trusting our instincts, or being painted as the over-anxious parents wasting everyone’s time. The bloods actually came back abnormal and we were finally referred to a paediatrician.  \r\nHelp at last. Or so we thought.  \r\nWe were seen by the local paediatrics in February 21. The receptionist said they had seen many children suffering with prolonged symptoms after Covid. We were devastated to hear about other children suffering but also relieved we were not alone.  \r\nThe paediatrician we saw was kind and checked them over as best they could. They said it did sound like Long Covid, but admitted they didn’t know enough about the condition to help. However, the paediatrician said there was a Long Covid clinic especially for children at Evelina Hospital in London, which she referred them to. Another sigh of relief from us – help AND validation!  \r\nAfter a few weeks, I hadn’t heard anything, so I called to chase. The administrator said that some cases are being rejected but they would do everything they could to help. An anxious wait for a few days, but the receptionist then called me back with the news that the Infectious Disease Department had indeed rejected them, but they were going to be seen under General Paediatrics instead. We had an appointment for a month’s time.  \r\nThe day before the appointment, I got a call from the Head of Paediatrics at Evelina hospital. They said they are cancelling the appointment and they’re discharged from the hospital because they don’t have the funding to deal with Long Covid in children yet.  \r\nThe despair and frustration was horrific. How could they dismiss sick children just like that? All those months of waiting, of fighting for help - over, just like that!  \r\nThe staff member couldn’t apologise enough and said there is supposed to be a Long Covid clinic for children there but they haven’t received funding yet. Long Covid Clinics for children didn’t exist. Once again they said they are doing everything they can and acknowlledged that there are many children suffering, that children DO get Long Covid and there are families fighting for answers and she feels terrible they can’t help.  \r\nOur current appointment with the local paediatrician is in January 2022. And that call from Evelina was over a month ago now. We don’t hold out much hope.  \r\nWe feel like nobody cares about Long Covid in children & that nobody cares about the unknown impact on their health, now or in the future.  \r\nAnd we’re the lucky ones!  \r\nOther families’ children are being left paralysed, suffering seizures and/or coughing up blood from Covid and they’re being diagnosed with anxiety! Forced to attend school when they are desperately ill. It’s like some kind of collective denial amongst some medical staff. We feel that it beggars belief that this is happening to children in the UK in the year 2021.

I went to my pharmacy, where I was advised that they All at pharmacy had the same bad allergic reaction to a batch of face masks last week, and that I need a Hydrocortisone cream, which is only available on prescription. I went to my surgery only to be told that there no doctor's appointments for the next 2 weeks, that I can try calling surgery everyday at 8 am by phone to get emergency appointment. well, it is almost impossible to get through on the phone at 8am, tried it several times before.  \r\nThe Surgery advised me to call NHS 111 number.  \r\nI called that number, went through many hoops with the automated queuing system for almost 7 minutes. A consultant answered my call. They asked me at least 10 questions, first to verify who I was, then about my health problem. In the end they advised to call my surgery and see my GP in order to get a prescription for Hydrocortisone cream,  \r\nI told this person that I cannot get an appointment with my GP even for next week and I cannot get a prescription for more than a week. That the problem was with the surgery and the staff working in the reception, who were completely unhelpful, and doing nothing at all to help me.  \r\nI found this interaction with NHS-111 pointless. I felt it abused my trust, because I spoke to a person who is just a telephone operator, with no medical qualifications what so ever.  \r\nThis person read out a lot of pointless questions, that have Nothing to do with my health problem.  \r\nIn the end this person tells me to telephone my surgery and book an appointment with your GP.  \r\nBasically, I spoke to someone who knows Nothing about health or medications. I told them my personal health problems, but this person is not equipped in any way what so ever to help me with my medical problem because this person is not a doctor. This person is not even an experienced nurse - it is absolutely Nobody in terms of health/ medical issues.  \r\nNow, that I look back on the conversation I had with this nobody, I feel angry because I should have asked who I was speaking to at the very beginning of conversation.  \r\nI do not know why I trusted NHS, that I would be speaking with a professional, medical person about my health and my personal details. I consider that my trust was betrayed.  \r\nWhat is the purpose of talking to a Non-Qualified person about my health problems?  \r\nThe Non-Qualified person employed by NHS could not help me in any way with my predicament - namely - I need a prescription for Hydrocortisone cream, because they are not a qualified doctor.  \r\nYet, I told them at the very beginning that I needed a prescription for a steroid cream.  \r\nThey should have told me at the beginning that they could not give me a prescription, because they were not a doctor, instead of going through the entire rigmarole of irrelevant questions - to tell me at the end to telephone my Surgery and ask to see my GP.  \r\nRound and round we go - that was my outcome from NHS 111  \r\nThe Surgery tells its patient to call NHS 111, and NHS 111 tells the patient to call the surgery.  \r\nRound and round we go - no wonder there are more and more people suffering mental health issues - this alone can drive one round the bend.  \r\nA Very Frustrated, Angry and Disappointed NHS patient  \r\nI am sure one of many millions Very Frustrated, Angry and Disappointed NHS patients.  \r\nThe whole system is disintegrating !  \r\nI feel on my own and that I will not get help from the NHS Surgery when I need it  \r\nI may get help in a hospital, but I must be close to dying.  \r\n","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-07-15T18:20:04.6166667","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2021-07-26T09:20:02.12","readBy":[],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/862935","id":"862935"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/862935/responses","id":"862935"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/862935/healthservices","id":"862935"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/862935/tags","id":"862935"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/g85042","id":"G85042","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rru","id":"RRU","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/angry","id":"angry"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/betrayed","id":"betrayed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disappointed","id":"disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frustrated","id":"frustrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20frustrated","id":"very frustrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/access%20to%20gp","id":"access to GP"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/allergic","id":"allergic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/alone","id":"alone"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cream","id":"cream"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/expertise","id":"expertise"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/face","id":"face"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gp%20surgery","id":"gp surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helpful","id":"helpful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pharmacy","id":"Pharmacy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/phone%20system","id":"phone system"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pointless","id":"pointless"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/skin","id":"skin"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/trust","id":"Trust"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/access%20to%20medication","id":"access to medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20disappointed","id":"very disappointed"}]},{"id":864890,"author":"EstherQoP","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"A referral I need to join a pottery group","body":"I have recently been through the single point of access where I was referred onto a course for managing emotions through STEP. There is a 6 month waiting list. In the meantime there is a question of what I am going to do until then. My friend is doing a course in pottery at the Art House in Sheffield. My friend's son is a volunteer there. I have never tried pottery and was keen to get involved. I was informed there was enough room for me to join. However, they needed me to be referred by Sheffield Health and Social Care (SHSC). I contacted the STEP team and they said they couldn't refer me. I am aghast at the lack of initiative shown for someone to make a phone call on my behalf. I am being proactive in self-help and knew that the pottery course would be of great therapeutic benefit.  \r\nInstead, the member of staff I spoke to from SHSC I felt, hid behind policy and said they didn't make referrals. It's not me, granted, but if I had taken my call I would've gone the extra mile (or in this case a few steps) to enable me to access the pottery course. To say that all is needed is a call or letter to confirm that I am in the system I feel really let down. The person at the other end of the phone for SHSC told me they could understand my frustration. I beg to differ.  \r\nTo say that AMBITION is one of the SHSC's values I see very little shown here. I am sick of being passed from pillar to post.  \r\nHow difficult is it to make a phone call?","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-07-22T19:13:49.6766667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-07-26T09:20:03.183","readBy":[{"name":"Sheffield Health and Social Care NHS Foundation Trust","count":8},{"name":"Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust ","count":1},{"name":"Healthwatch Sheffield","count":1},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2021)","count":1},{"name":"NHS Sheffield ICB","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/864890","id":"864890"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/864890/responses","id":"864890"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/864890/healthservices","id":"864890"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/864890/tags","id":"864890"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/tah-spa","id":"TAH-spa","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/tah-step","id":"TAH-STEP","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/access%20to%20services","id":"access to services"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/group","id":"group"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/me","id":"ME"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/policy","id":"policy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/referral","id":"referral"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting%20list","id":"waiting list"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/866062","id":"866062"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/877282","id":"877282"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/877548","id":"877548"}]},{"id":864908,"author":"Shawx79","authorRoleId":8,"authorRole":"a staff member posting for a patient/service user","title":"Being told about the scan the night before would have saved rushing","body":"I came into the emergency department on Friday past and spent a few days there on a trolly beds but the staff eventually got me a hospital bed and I was made much more comfortable.

For example yesterday I was woke at 8 and told to rush with carers round me to make a scan at 8. 20am. I am an elderly woman and we like to take our time and get quite panicky when rushed especially when you are only just awake. The carers were still lovely and apologetic but I feel if I was told a time to be ready the night before I could have been up and ready to go at my own pace and save everyone rushing. The staff down at the theatre are lovely. The ward is very clean, sometimes the toilets could be cleaner but this is not the staffs fault it is some patients fault.

Luckly i've heard a young girl saying that she was positive so immediately the nurse sent her outside to wait and at that stage i said that i was positive as well. 111 didn't communicate at the hospital that i was positive to Covid when they booked me in, unbelievable!

I explained that I had been to the pharmacy earlier on that morning and had been advised that the bite was infected and he required antibiotics hence my call to 111. I explained to the GP that my son had a large open wound was in severe pain and also had a temperature which would have been due to the infection. He told me that in most cases a hydrocortisone cream would be used, I explained the pharmacist had already advised not to use this cream. He then proceeded to tell me that if my son showed any sign of a temperature upon attending the surgery that he would be turned away as he wasn’t prepared to see him. I explained that his temperature was his body trying to fight the infection away, he just repeated as before he wouldn’t see him and he would be turned away but if I wanted to still pop down to do so. I ask what my options would be if he did have a temperature when I arrive he again said he wouldn’t be seen and sent to the children’s hospital! \nI took my son to the surgery anyway and upon my arrival was told the GP would be informed I was here, I wasn’t told where to wait until about 20 minutes later when another member of staff brought out a prescription for another patient. Another GP then come to the door took our temperatures, my sons was a little high but she said not to worry and invited us in.I explained what her colleague said and she told me he wasn’t very diplomatic and that she was quite happy to see my son. He was given antibiotics and had his wound dress, I thanked the doctor that saw us and explained my frustrations in regards to her colleague. I had no issues at all with the GP who saw us she was very kind caring and understand. \nI completely understand the need for precaution at the moment due to covid but I had waited 5 hrs for my initial call back, to the be told he would be turned away if he showed a sign of a temperature. It’s disgusting that a child of the age of 3 can be refused treatment, I knew he had an infection that needed to be treated as soon as possible. Had the GP that called me been the person who we had been presented with at the surgery he would have turned us away and we would have had a very very long wait at the children hospital.
