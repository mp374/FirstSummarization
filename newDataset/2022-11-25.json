This was ridiculous, as it was the middle of the night.  \r\nThe lack of communication when waiting and after being reviewed was awful. My son was reviewed by a student nurse who did not introduce theirself, communicate anything they were doing, ask anything about my son's medication history, and tried to give further medication. I communicated these concerns already to a nurse on shift.  \r\nI was asked about throat swabs on my baby to make sure his tonsillitis was not bacterial. I agreed. I have since received a text to tell me my baby's PCR was negative. I was not asked about any PCR test, I would have said no to this considering how much pain he was in and how many times his tonsils were examined. I already carried out an LFT prior to coming, which was negative. Nobody asked about covid.  \r\nI would like to say that Dorothy is an absolute credit to the CDU. She could not have done enough for us, continuously checking in and offering support when my baby was continuously screaming in pain.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-11-24T15:22:01.1633333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-11-25T08:58:59.343","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":5}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1000874","id":"1000874"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1000874/responses","id":"1000874"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1000874/healthservices","id":"1000874"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1000874/tags","id":"1000874"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sj9-children-accident-emergency","id":"sj9-children-accident-emergency","score":2},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frustrated","id":"frustrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/a&e","id":"a&e"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/consent","id":"consent"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tonsillitis","id":"tonsillitis"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1001143","id":"1001143"}]},{"id":1000886,"author":"watermc75","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"My experience in Labour Ward","body":"I recently gave birth to a little boy, & just want to send a little message to say thank you to Kerry & her colleague (apologies, forgotten her name - baby brain) for such a pleasant experience with my first born.  \r\nBoth Kerry & her colleague made us feel comfortable & looked after us from the moment we left Ward 16 until we returned to Ward 16.

Once the scan began, my wife asked the radiographer if they were able to talk us through each part of the scan as they were taking photos, and with a snippy tone the radiographer asked if we could give them a minute, which set the tone for the rest of the scan. The radiographer seemed as if the whole process was an inconvenience, and lacked the usual communication skills that other NHS staff have in abundance.  \r\nMy wife had also been showing early signs of pelvic girdle pain, so when she was being scanned the radiographer asked if she was Ok, as she had winced a little. My wife replied yes and mentioned the pain, and the radiographer's first concern was to make it clear they weren't pushing hard, which wasn’t what was insinuated at all. While the radiographer did all parts of the scan as expected, the harsh attitude and lack of communication skills actually ruined the experience a bit for me and my wife.  \r\nThe radiographer, in a monotone voice, asked if we were ready to hear the gender, then continued to give us our news in the same monotone way, expressing no joy or happiness for us. In contrast with the 12 weeks scan at the same place, where the radiographer was so helpful and reassuring, a totally opposite experience.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-11-24T16:58:36.4133333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-11-25T09:51:12.73","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lanarkshire","count":3}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1000904","id":"1000904"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1000904/responses","id":"1000904"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1000904/healthservices","id":"1000904"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1000904/tags","id":"1000904"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l308h_501","id":"L308H_501","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frustrated","id":"frustrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/attitude","id":"attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/empathy","id":"empathy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/maternity","id":"maternity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/other%20staff","id":"other staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pregnancy","id":"pregnancy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scan","id":"scan"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1001166","id":"1001166"}]},{"id":1000862,"author":"marchhx34","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Appointment to start PrEP treatment","body":"The doctor and nurse put me at ease straight away and were both very friendly and funny.

My son is presenting with severe anxiety, low mood and suicidal thoughts.  \r\nI have been referred by my GP - rejected, Community Paediatrician- rejected, and finally self referred him on a mission as we were desperate for help.  \r\nThis time made it as far as the assessment, the practitioner in CAMHS was very rude, I felt them to be full of self importance and furthermore stated that Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation trust are not commissioned to deal with mental health that results from a neurological condition. They also backed this up saying my son is not capable of working with them - despite the fact they never tried.  \r\nThis is no game show this is my sons life, CAHMS said oh he won’t try and kill himself at his age but to make sure any hazards are locked away as he could do it by accident. CAHMS said if he’s that bad take him to accident and emergency - is this the expert medical opinion of Nottinghamshire Healthcare or just a few individuals?  \r\nWe saw three different practitioners none who we felt were qualified to diagnose, only whom were able to point to a pathway ie low mood, anxiety with the agreement of a follow up MDT team (most who have not met my son)  \r\nSo fast forward in the same month, my son is rejected by CAHMS I have now secured him an appointment this month (the same month) with a qualified doctor at Great Ormond Street psychiatry Department whom agreed my son has complex neurological and mental health issues and needs urgent help. My sons presentation is the same but I actually got a medical opinion.  \r\nI feel they have used covid, lack of funds, patient back logs all as excuses. Nottinghamshire Healthcare are not lacking funding, I feel they need a complete reorganisation and they need to train/recruit qualified staff that want to help children and not look for reasons not too. It seems to me that their team ask why shall we reject this child and not what can we do to help.  \r\nTo those parents out there like me do not loose hope, keep fighting because your children are precious and they need you to advocate for them. I say don’t accept no for an answer, get informed look at the NICE guidelines and learn your child’s right under the NHS legalisation and take complaints higher if you have to.  \r\nAll I know is that I have now secured help for my son, I have to travel to London and this battle with Nottinghamshire Healthcare had given me a terrible journey that has affected my mental health, all un-necessary.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-11-22T20:30:21.4433333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-11-25T10:04:21.103","readBy":[{"name":"Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust","count":8}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1000084","id":"1000084"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1000084/responses","id":"1000084"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1000084/healthservices","id":"1000084"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1000084/tags","id":"1000084"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rha-camhs-county","id":"rha-camhs-county","score":1},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disgusted","id":"disgusted"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/should%20listen","id":"Should listen"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/adhd","id":"adhd"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/asd","id":"ASD"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/behaviour","id":"behaviour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/camhs","id":"camhs"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diagnoses","id":"Diagnoses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/empathy","id":"empathy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/impersonal%20care","id":"impersonal care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/patient%20focus","id":"patient focus"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/poor%20quality","id":"poor quality"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/rejected","id":"Rejected"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/time%20wasted","id":"time wasted"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/excuse%20making","id":"excuse making"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/rejected%20referral","id":"rejected referral"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/referral%20rejected","id":"referral rejected"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/better%20triage%20system","id":"better triage system"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1001284","id":"1001284"}]},{"id":1001158,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"....... lean on me ..... when you're not strong .…","body":"The words above reflect what the whole team of people do every day, and night, at QE.

I was cared for by both Obstetrics and the General Surgical team, and the care I received throughout was exceptional and patient-centred. I honestly can't praise everyone enough.  \r\nMaternity Assessment was my first port of call, and they quickly diagnosed what likely was happening (they were right). The staff were so kind and reassuring. Over the next 5 days I was in various wards - Labour, Post -Labour and Ward 48. Every single staff member I encountered was supportive and delivered incredible care. It was an extremely scary situation for me and my family, and both ward staff and consultants went above and beyond in helping keep my pain under control, monitoring my then unborn son, and explaining everything to me.  \r\nI had surgery, in which the incredible Obstetrics team delivered my son via c-section, and then in a very unusual situation, General Surgery took over to complete a second surgery. While I had a double surgery, the experience was so positive. Everyone introduced themselves pre-surgery, and while I was terrified, I felt in extremely safe hands. I had a spinal for the c-section, and the team did this to give me as positive a birth experience as possible.  \r\nThis meant the world to me as I got to hear my son cry, see him, hold him on my chest and kiss him before I was put under general anaesthetic for the rest of the surgery. The way the obstetric and surgical team got together to make this happen was truly incredible. They not only put our health first, but also my mental well-being. Everyone involved in my surgery - both in organising and those actually in the room - are absolutely wonderful professionals.  \r\nAfter surgery I was in High Dependency and the staff there are just amazing. The level of care was outstanding. From taking my vitals and endless cannulas (my body was over having them), they helped me recover so much quicker with their care and kindness. This included helping my son come over and see me, and once I was well enough, helping make it possible to go to the Special Baby Unit at the other side of hospital to see my baby.

He now needs a referral to the Sarcoma MDT in Leeds however we still can’t get a GP appointment to do this urgent referral. We have finally managed to send the scan and reports through to them (receptionists couldn’t locate them for a while) but have been told no doctors are available but a doctor would be available next week. She then said we should call back again tomorrow to see if any are free. This is hugely stressful given the tumour is likely to be cancerous and we need to move as quickly as we can. My partner was also met with a great lack of empathy and understanding from the receptionist. I work very closely with the NHS so I understand the huge pressures staff are under but the process for a potential cancer patient has been utterly appalling and extremely upsetting. He hasn’t seen a GP in years and is not a strain on the system, but the lack of regard and help has been truly astounding. The process has surprised me as generally the practice he always been flexible when it’s with regards to my children.

There was no level of care, the staff member that I saw was rude and made me feel as if I was a burden. I was being seen as I had a lot of pain in my throat, they shoved a lolly stick around my mouth and was very rough with me. They knocked my teeth and this was sore, there was no apology.  \r\nThey were very rude and abrupt when they spoke to me. They also wished to sound my chest, so they moved my clothing away and my back bra strap without asking if this was okay. This made me feel uncomfortable further.  \r\nThe whole appointment was a disaster, and the practitioner made me feel silly and as if I was completely wasting their time. I wish I had said something at the time, but I was just so shocked by what I had experienced. I left my appointment feeling even worse.  \r\nIn my view, the practitioner that I had seen certainly has no understanding of NHS values. They had no care or respect for me, and certainly no compassion.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-11-24T22:16:52.71","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-11-25T12:06:21.453","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Grampian","count":5}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1001024","id":"1001024"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1001024/responses","id":"1001024"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1001024/healthservices","id":"1001024"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1001024/tags","id":"1001024"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sn9-gp","id":"sn9-gp","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appalled","id":"appalled"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/shocked","id":"shocked"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/consent","id":"consent"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disrespected","id":"disrespected"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kindness","id":"kindness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/respect","id":"respect"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/throat","id":"throat"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/uncomfortable","id":"uncomfortable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassion","id":"compassion"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/felt%20a%20burden","id":"felt a burden"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1001987","id":"1001987"}]},{"id":1001193,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":" Very poor phone appointment  bookings","body":"Very disappointed with appointment bookings I had to wait 1hour 51 mins for someone to finally answer my phone. \nNo issues with The doctors and all members of staff at this surgery as they all are doing great job and I have always been pleased with the care I received at this surgery.\nThe only problem being phone appointment bookings time this needs seriously addressed and sorted.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-11-24T21:09:20","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-11-25T12:06:29","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1001193","id":"1001193"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1001193/responses","id":"1001193"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1001193/healthservices","id":"1001193"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1001193/tags","id":"1001193"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/f81001","id":"F81001","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disappointed","id":"disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20pleased","id":"very pleased"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pleased","id":"pleased"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20disappointed","id":"very disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20pleased","id":"not pleased"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20great","id":"not great"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1001469","id":"1001469"}]},{"id":1001192,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Excellent Dr","body":"I attended an appointment at the mole clinic and saw such an amazing Gp ( unfortunately, I had to edit my review as was not allowed to name him, which is a shame) - he was so kind, listened and took the time to answer all my other queries and questions ( I came with more than one!)

I feel it important to provide this information and that it will be beneficial for staff reflection.  \r\nWhilst visiting my loved one, he appeared confused and was having low blood sugar readings. He was unable to recognise my husband when he arrived.  \r\nHis condition worsened and the next day he was hypoglycaemic again. I had said to an auxiliary that he was shaky and confused and I was told that he was like that because he has been sleeping all day and he had not eaten or drank anything.  \r\nThe next day, when I visited he was unresponsive, when I alerted his nurse, I was advised that they thought he was responsive. I said he was not. He was hypoglycaemic and the nurse came to rub gel into his gums. I said he is very unwell and he is deteriorating fast. At that the nurse held both their hands up and said with urgency (I felt, to stop me in my tracks) that they weren't his nurse today and that the nurse looking after him was on their break and would be back soon. They stated they were only there to administer the glucose gel as they were the only one there that could give it at that time.  \r\nI persisted with the nurse, because they knew my loved one and must see that he had deteriorated massively . They replied that they had reported that that morning and they went back to their daily duties with their own patients. I felt the nurses manner was totally inappropriate and very disconcerting.  \r\nThe staff knew he was insulin dependant diabetic and he was not eating and they did not arrange for him to have any fluids or encourage sips for hydration.  \r\nA lovely nurse came to speak with me the same day and said that they were trying to get my loved one a medical bed in 2F and that he would be transferred as soon as they could get a bed.  \r\nAnother nurse was also very concerned about my loved one's condition and expressed their condolences that he wasn't his usual self. They were really lovely and empathetic .  \r\nThe next visit, I pressed the emergency buzzer as my loved one seemed to be taking a turn? A stroke? He was unresponsive at this stage but looked distressed as if he had secretions and was going to be sick. His left eye was rolling to the top of his head. I was extremely alarmed and concerned.  \r\nThree nurses arrived quickly and were debating whether this was a “peri” and whether they should put a call out.  \r\nI said frantically he needs a doctor now, he has had an incident. One nurse replied that they had been trying to get a doctor all morning (it was afternoon at this point) and they were aware of his condition.  \r\nI was frantically saying that they needed to put out a call urgently, they need to know he is having an acute incident now. I was very distressed. The nurse left and called an Advanced Nurse Practitioner (ANP).  \r\nThe ANP took the time after their examination to say that they have taken bloods and they didn’t think he had had a stroke but that they were to request an urgent CT scan. They were caring in their manner.  \r\nI feel that the ward staff in 5B all knew my loved one very well and they did nothing in the early stages to raise alarm regarding his deteriorating condition within a 48-72 hr period.  \r\nIt makes my heart so heavy to have to say that my loved one passed away in ward 2F following a 10 day stay (following emergency transfer from 5B).  \r\nI know 5B is a boarding ward and as such, is restricted in numbers of registered staff but I feel my loved one's condition could have been managed more appropriately and his deterioration should have been escalated about three or four days earlier.  \r\nThe nurse's unfortunate manner that day has stuck with me and I feel that they could have done more to escalate the situation. I felt their manner was abrupt and non-caring.  \r\nHe was left overnight and unresponsive in a 6 bedded area which I feel is highly inappropriate.  \r\nI appreciate the demands on staff and the lack of registered staff on 5B due to the nature of the ward but he must have been the sickest patient there that day! I was alarmed at the dismissive attitude of the nurse when they held their hands up and said they were just there to give the glucose gel. I am the only one that can give it.  \r\nThis saddens me. It would only have taken a moment to show a bit of empathy and appreciation for my level of concern. More so because they knew him so well and also they knew me due to my numerous visits to ward 5B through the year.  \r\nPerhaps there could be a reflection on this and consider the manner shown and the escalation process of a sick and deteriorating patient. I appreciate that the nurse was not his named nurse that day but they knew him so well and had recognised that he was sick. My grievance is their manner and lack of compassion shown when I was obviously distressed and alarmed at my loved one's worsening condition.  \r\nThis ward is clearly very busy and seemed to be unable to seek medical staff in such an acute and deteriorating patient. I feel very unhappy with the care provided to my loved one in the 72 hrs prior to his transfer to ward 2F.  \r\nHis death was inevitable as he had many medical conditions, but a little care and compassion and recognition of deterioration would have gone a long way and made his death more bearable for us loved ones.  \r\nI wish to express my sincere thanks to one of your nurses support and compassion in the immediate transfer period. They helped us a lot.","criticality":"strongly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-11-07T23:22:49.06","progress":"Story has a

They allowed me to be with him during the scan and this helped enormously with his anxiety.  \r\nOnce finished, the technician said they'd noticed he was on the waiting list for a CT scan, too. They asked if we were in a rush, and if not we were welcome to wait and they'd get his CT scan done. We said thanks very much and waited for it to be done.  \r\nActually, the whole service with regards to his wonky knees has been excellent and reassuring, as it's our first venture into adult services after spending lots and lots of time in hospital or having appointments with various doctors over the years. Lots of those times were also very positive and we've been fortunate to have fantastic working relationships with many medical professionals from many disciplines. .  \r\nAfter a recent (recurring) knee dislocation, my son was referred to the knee clinic. His appointment was just 3 weeks from the date of referral. And now 3 weeks later he's had both tests which were required. He's just waiting on his follow-up appointment now.  \r\nWith all the doom and gloom around and complaints about waiting times, I felt it was important to shine a light on this very positive experience we've recently had.  \r\nThank you.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-11-25T12:51:34.1933333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-11-25T13:10:03.62","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Fife","count":11},{"name":"Fife Health & Social Care Partnership","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1001206","id":"1001206"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1001206/responses","id":"1001206"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1001206/healthservices","id":"1001206"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1001206/tags","id":"1001206"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/f704h_110_oos","id":"F704H_110_OOS","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/f704h-xray","id":"F704H-Xray","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/above%20and%20beyond","id":"above and beyond"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ct%20scan","id":"CT scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dislocation","id":"dislocation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kind","id":"kind"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/knee","id":"knee"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mri","id":"mri"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/radiology","id":"radiology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/understanding","id":"understanding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting%20time","id":"waiting time"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/well%20cared%20for","id":"well cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassuring","id":"reassuring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20ease","id":"at ease"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1001773","id":"1001773"}]},{"id":1001214,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Great Service","body":"I called just after 8am and by 8:10am I had been booked in to see the GP by a very friendly lady.

I felt much more at ease because I knew what to expect during the procedure because of Jessie's reassurance.Staff like Jessie are what make experiences of care so positive, and I'd be very grateful if she received recognition for her wonderful manner and evident care and compassion for others.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-11-25T11:44:11.05","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-11-25T13:18:00.81","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Highland","count":2},{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":6}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1001176","id":"1001176"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1001176/responses","id":"1001176"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1001176/healthservices","id":"1001176"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1001176/tags","id":"1001176"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/c418h-radiology","id":"C418H-radiology","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/imaging","id":"imaging"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scan","id":"scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/x-ray","id":"X-ray"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassion","id":"compassion"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassuring","id":"reassuring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wonderful","id":"wonderful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/explanations","id":"explanations"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20manner","id":"staff manner"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20ease","id":"at ease"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1001224","id":"1001224"}]},{"id":1001213,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"very professional and personable GP","body":"greeted by first name\nnot rushed, but prioritised in surgery intervention (jab) whilst reviewing HbA1c and BP - changed meds\nusual good advice and more support offered","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-11-24T21:50:52","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-11-25T13:18:35","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1001213","id":"1001213"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1001213/responses","id":"1001213"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1001213/healthservices","id":"1001213"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1001213/tags","id":"1001213"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/k84009","id":"K84009","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hba1c","id":"HBA1c"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20good","id":"not good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/rushed","id":"rushed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/prioritised","id":"prioritised"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1002658","id":"1002658"}]},{"id":1001216,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Good service","body":"Had a bit of a hiccup with my appointment rang reception and it was sorted swiftly with a pleasant chat and explanation to receptionist","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-11-24T21:53:15","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2022-11-25T13:19:50","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1001216","id":"1001216"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1001216/responses","id":"1001216"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1001216/healthservices","id":"1001216"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1001216/tags","id":"1001216"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/b83041","id":"B83041","score":null}]},{"id":1001167,"author":"RMoore","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Once things were moving we felt completely looked after","body":"We did have a long wait on the ward for induction.

I was not allowed to see the delivery suite in DHH and that was causing some level of worry as we did not know what to expect. At home, we could have the room set up as we wanted and that helped massively. I was over 30 weeks pregnant when we made the decision of having a home birth.  \r\nThe antenatal care that we received from the Birth at Home Team cannot be compared to anything. It is beyond amazing. It is completely person- centred, there is no rushing to get the appointment finished with and the personalities, care and attention of each individual team member, made our journey so special. The visits happened in the comfort of our home and the checks completed with baby were fantastic.  \r\nMy husband was worried about a home birth, wondering if it would be safe as there is no doctor in the home and what if things went wrong. In the initial visit from Paula and Sadie, they had provided us with their knowledge and experience that made us both feel safe and able to proceed with a home birth. The biggest relief was knowing that should I have needed to transfer into hospital, ambulance control and the midwifery unit were already notified at the beginning of my labour and therefore they would be expecting me.  \r\nDuring my labour, Sadie and Lois were such a good source of support and we all had great craic also which made things easier. These ladies were by my side when I needed them and also left my husband and I in private at times. We had the most magical birth story and they both respected my birth plan. We are forever grateful to Sadie and Lois for helping us bring our baby girl safely into this world in the comfort of our own home.  \r\nThe postnatal care has also been phenomenal. Again, visits are person- centred, there is no rush, you feel empowered to ask questions and reassured by the extensive knowledge of the team. My husband and I cannot thank the Birth at Home team enough, they are only operating in the last year and we wish them every success in the future.  \r\nI would encourage any woman or couple to at least consider a home birth. It might not be for everyone, but when you educate yourself on the less risks associated with home births and you become involved with this team, you can be assured that the care provided to you will be exceptional. Thank you to the full team and in particular Paula, Sadie and Lois. We will never forget you all.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-11-25T10:14:37.1733333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-11-25T13:32:46.633","readBy":[{"name":"Southern Health and Social Care Trust","count":5}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1001159","id":"1001159"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1001159/responses","id":"1001159"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1001159/healthservices","id":"1001159"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1001159/tags","id":"1001159"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003-community-midwifery-nm","id":"zt003-community-midwifery-nm","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/above%20and%20beyond","id":"above and beyond"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/antenatal","id":"antenatal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/birth","id":"birth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/labour","id":"labour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/level%20of%20care","id":"level of care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/midwives","id":"midwives"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/person-centred","id":"person-centred"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pregnancy","id":"pregnancy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing","id":"amazing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/empowered","id":"empowered"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported","id":"supported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/great%20team","id":"great team"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/home%20birth%20team","id":"home birth team"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1004784","id":"1004784"}]},{"id":1001222,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Appalling !

It feels like my mental health is downplayed and blamed on my autism and ADHD. I feel like this is then resulting in me not receiving the help and treatment I need.  \r\nI’m really struggling with my mental health and it hurts so much inside to know I’m not being believed.  \r\nThere’s also other ongoing issues like difficulty getting in contact with the MHT and things not being followed up. I wish I had some point of contact like a care coordinator or CPN to help me with this because I’m really struggling with it.  \r\nI had an appointment with a different Dr today who was honestly really lovely. But he wasn’t able to change my medication even though I was told I would receive the same level of care. The reason he gave was that the medication change has to be done by the consultant.  \r\nThis has really annoyed me because the MHT knew that I was going to be discussing other treatment options, so I don’t understand why I was given an appointment with someone who was unable to do that.  \r\nSomething he said that has really upset me was that the medication I asked about was for people who are severely depressed. That feels really invalidating because I’m feeling really depressed but yet they’re not acknowledging that.  \r\nIt feels like that what I’m feeling inside is not what they’re seeing on the outside. I don’t know if that’s because of my anxiety, I get really nervous talking to them. I think it could also be because of my autism, as I really struggle communicating what’s in my head, verbally. But I feel like that they should already be aware of that.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-11-24T18:03:42.1166667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-11-25T14:53:58.19","readBy":[{"name":"Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust","count":11}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1000916","id":"1000916"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1000916/responses","id":"1000916"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1000916/healthservices","id":"1000916"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1000916/tags","id":"1000916"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rha-millbrook","id":"RHA-millbrook","score":1},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/annoyed","id":"annoyed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20being%20listened%20to","id":"not being listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sad","id":"sad"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/adhd","id":"adhd"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/autism","id":"autism"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/depression","id":"depression"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/follow%20up","id":"follow up"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/invalidated","id":"invalidated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20believed","id":"not believed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unhappy","id":"unhappy"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1004518","id":"1004518"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1004895","id":"1004895"}]},{"id":1001244,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Brilliant service","body":"Super friendly receptionist, under 5\nMinutes wait time from arrival to being seen.
