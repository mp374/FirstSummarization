A call from our regular GP was arranged and got it same day. The GP spoke with the patient and actually diagnosed what he thought it could be, and wasted no time. He had a chest x ray that morning and then referred him the same day for full body scan.  \r\nIt turned out that our GP was absolutely correct with the diagnosis he made from knowing the patient and his expertise as a GP. From that day Dr Danaher was there anytime we needed advice or simply just someone with outstanding knowledge to talk to. My husband was admitted for the tests to confirm extent and stage of cancer, but once that was done I asked he was discharged home where he was happy and comfortable. It was the support of our GP that kept us both going and caring for my husband myself in our own home came from the courage I gained from our GP. He was always on hand to give me advise when I was uncertain if I was giving the best care if it was something I knew nothing about.  \r\nI was immensely grateful I had Dr Danaher to turn to for advice. He often spoke on phone with my husband, with full empathy, compassion, kindness and understanding. He knew how to chat with my husband and I noticed after a call with Dr Danaher he would be smiling and happy. This was down to a dedicated doctor. We both felt blessed to have him at such a crucial sad time in the life we shared together.  \r\nI would question whether I giving the right care at home neither of us wanted any hospital admission if could be avoided. Our home is where we shared our life’s together and this is where we both wanted to continue to share our last months together. Dr Danaher would reassure me I was doing a great job and I’d turn to him for his advice on anything that could help. Nothing was ever to much trouble for our dr ,he’d be straight onto anything needed immediately .from food supplement drinks to medication just anything he thought may be of help he would have it sorted immediately.  \r\nMy husband lived for 5 months after diagnosis. His hospital consultant was equally as kind but didn’t know us as our doctor soes but still she arranged hospital bed and other essential equipment on same day I said David can no longer make the stairs safely and was too weak to try again. She was compassionate kind and caring thanks to our doctor I managed to care full time for David in our own home where we’d shared the love, laughter, tears joy and pain together.  \r\nWith my ongoing struggle of poor mental health and GAD it was at times so overwhelming on me I’d again turn to Dr Danaher for support. I was always given as much time as I needed to talk. It is now 18 months on and I still get the support when needed from Dr Danaher. He has a true passion for his role as a doctor and it shines through that he does this job out of passion to help patients. I can honestly say knowing I have got Dr Danaher to talk to has a huge positive affect on my mental health. I really don’t know how I’d be today without the knowledge that he is at hand when things become too overwhelming for me. I feel all his patients are truly blessed to have a GP that cares so much and goes well above and beyond his call of duty.  \r\nAs a GP his patients are his prime concern he’s simply one in a million. I just only wish there was a way of forwarding him for a GP award - he most certainly deserves to be recognised for the quality of patient care he gives. I will be forever thankful to him for the kindness compassion and time he gave to us and my husband would certainly agree with all I say.  \r\nNor is he wrong with the diagnoses he makes on my health issues which are very complex and challenging but Dr Danaher never fails to get correct diagnosis. Trust is something I struggle badly with when it comes to my health but I can honestly say I never doubt Dr Danaher  \r\nI’d really like you to recognise the dedication this GP gives to his patients and if possible forward him for a dedicated patient GP award. I have spent time searching how I could do this but to no avail.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-03-18T23:28:08.41","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2023-03-25T12:20:02.79","readBy":[],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1043907","id":"1043907"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1043907/responses","id":"1043907"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1043907/healthservices","id":"1043907"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1043907/tags","id":"1043907"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/c82005","id":"C82005","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/concern","id":"concern"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/above%20and%20beyond","id":"above and beyond"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/advice","id":"advice"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/availability","id":"availability"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cancer","id":"cancer"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/caring","id":"caring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/consultant","id":"consultant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dedication","id":"dedication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diagnoses","id":"Diagnoses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctor","id":"doctor"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/empathy","id":"empathy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/end%20of%20life","id":"end of life"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kind","id":"kind"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kindness","id":"kindness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/positive","id":"positive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/signs","id":"signs"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tests","id":"tests"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/understanding","id":"understanding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassion","id":"compassion"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassionate","id":"compassionate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happy","id":"happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported","id":"supported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/trust","id":"Trust"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/prompt%20response","id":"prompt response"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20time","id":"given time"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nothing%20too%20much%20trouble","id":"nothing too much trouble"}]},{"id":1039847,"author":"Mrs R66","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"They do a great job and the calls are very useful","body":"My blood pressure had been really high and I had been feeling dizzy, I used to go to physiotherapy where it was picked up that my blood pressure was abnormally high.

Then during the visit he was reading from his computer from all my previous papers (he was literally not telling the truth at the begining).\nThe doctor was then talking about something totally different from my case ( he mentioned shorter leg and tilted neck without evidence!!!) , he never talk about my case except that he said, Yes, you have disk but all of the people has disk !!! He said he got more than 10 disks!!! He think this is something not important to treat and he exactly said \"you don't need me\"\n\n Really? I was waiting for this appointment for 2 years suffering from severe pain. \n\nHe refers me back to Orthopedic which it needs now more time to wait until an appointment with ortho to see me and refer me to treatment again. \nThis is really unacceptable and inconvenient.\n\nThe clinic reception and the staff in the clinic are all very rude And unhelpful except of the nurse that was helping to be a chaperone, she is nice.\n\nThe doctor asked me to make some movements to check and I did them and he supposed to know these are not good movements in my case as I didn't sleep all night because of the pain in my back and couldn't even move to get pain killer (I live with my children only and they were sleeping). I am in a severe pain now while today is weekend and no GPs.

When I finally got through at a quarter past 8 I was told there were no more telephone appointments.\n\nI filled in an e-consult for my problems and I got a phone call soon after - which was probably the best part of my whole experience - asking me to come in for a face to face appointment with the nurse that day.\n\nI come into the practice at my appointment time and there is a 15 minute wait after my scheduled time before the nurse calls my name. This is not something I would have minded as I understand that GP practices are busy but the NP didn't even bother to smile at me. I smiled at her several times and she just sort of ignored it. There was no attempt at making me feel comfortable or welcome in the practice and I felt awkward and like I was just using up her time. I know NHS staff are stressed but there should at least be an attempt at establishing patient rapport.\n\nShe immediately started off by saying that two of the problems I had could not be seen by the GP practice and I had to use other services, and she spent a little bit of time talking about my third problem but it seemed like she was more interested in closing the consultation - I want to point out that it was only at this point she seemed friendlier towards me. \n\nThere was no attempt to examine me and I felt like my concerns weren't even properly engaged with. I don't understand why this could not have been a telephone appointment. This could all have been done over the phone since she didn't even take a look at me, which I very much would have thought to be part of the consultation. To be made to come into the surgery and wait while ill, only to have a brief and fairly cold consultation seems like a massive waste of both my time and hers. This was a very very frustrating experience for me.\n\nAs someone who is a member of the healthcare profession myself, I was surprised and disappointed.

Their staff are mostly rude, unhelpful and over half of the receptionist don't know a knee from an elbow. For example my mum needed an open ended sick note, I got told that I would need certain documents from her Dr at the hospital, I got the documents and they still refused to do the sick note that she was more than entitled to due to her Motor Neuron Disease progression making her disabled and unable to look after herself let alone work. She also had a Dr refuse her tests when trying to find out what was wrong with her (she should have been booked in for an mri at the very least). A Dr also told her that taking one of the medications she's on would do nothing for her due to it being a small dose, my mother stopped taking that medicine due to that remark by the Dr and ended up in hospital a week later due to symptoms from not taking the medication.

NHS","body":"I recently attended the Rookery Medical Centre and really wanted to write a good review, as I think people are too quick to complain but not to offer appreciation, when credit is due.\nOn this occasion and in the years I have been a patient at the Rookery, I cannot fault the service and the truly amazing staff who work there.\nThis week the two different reception staff I spoke to, were so friendly, kind, empathetic, upbeat and helpful. As the faces of the practice I imagine they suffer a lot of challenging people, negativity and demands. I genuinely think they are angels to remain so positive and cheerful despite the day to day pressures of the role and that working in Primary Care brings. And this sentiment extends to the Doctors and nursing staff, HCAs, pharmacists and generally everyone I have encountered at the practice over the years.\nMy appointment I had this week with the Doctor, was such a positive experience and reflective of how great our NHS can be. He had a wonderful bedside manner - I did not feel rushed, he was very thorough and spent quite a considerable about of time (given how stretched things are) to understand my problems. He spent a lot of time explaining things so I understood them and made sure I knew & was clear with what the plan was going forward. And I have to say this has always been my experience of the practice, whichever GP, Nurse or HCA that I have seen.\nI find the phone consultations helpful and convenient for minor things and they have always given face to face appointments if necessary, or when I have really felt concerned.\nAt a time when the NHS/GP’s are overworked and face a lot of criticism, I cannot fault the Rookery Medical Centre. I have been a patient there for many years; since my childhood, my children are now patients and they have always gone above and beyond, whoever I have dealt with. And in terms of my children, I have always been reassured that I am not an “overreacting mum” and they will always see my kids if i feel really concerned. I cannot express how much of a comfort this is for any parent, that we are being listened to and taken seriously.\nBrilliant practice, amazing staff, well run and an absolutely credit to our NHS.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2023-03-25T11:36:48","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-03-25T20:23:36","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1046986","id":"1046986"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1046986/responses","id":"1046986"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1046986/healthservices","id":"1046986"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1046986/tags","id":"1046986"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/d83029","id":"D83029","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20listened%20to","id":"not listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/concerned","id":"concerned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/face","id":"face"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20good","id":"not good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20taken%20seriously","id":"not taken seriously"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/positive","id":"positive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/rushed","id":"rushed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/taken%20seriously","id":"taken seriously"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/understood","id":"understood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20concerned","id":"very concerned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appreciation","id":"appreciation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doing%20well","id":"doing well"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/listened%20to","id":"listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20great","id":"not great"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1047666","id":"1047666"}]},{"id":1046985,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Worst practise","body":"Walked into surgery with a serious issue requesting docs appointment.

She examined me, took a full history and told me of her plan for a DVT scan and an chest X-ray. I then got a much needed cup of tea! A care assistant took me for my scan ,then I went for my X-ray and back to Sdec All the staff from all departments were kind and caring. After a short wait the doctor returned with all my results ,explained everything to me .I had arrived at the hospital at 14.00 and at 16..30 I was on my way home with my medication, truly amazing. The efficiency of that department is the best I’ve ever seen,every member of staff was busy but still took the time to be patient and understanding when asked questions.I cannot think of enough words of praise  so Thankyou to all concerned.
