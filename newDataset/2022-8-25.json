I spoke to a lady who said I could only request an appointment for for that day or they could offer me 3 different dates at the same time (9am) as that's all they were aloud to offer me. I'm a single parent with two children with extreem mental heath issues. I tried to explain that I can't do 9am as its school time and I carnt do same day appointments as I have to emotionally prepare myself to be able to leave the house and struggle speaking to people on the phone (which is one of the reasons I was happy when i realised I could request appointments online) and that actually I was really struggling speaking to the lady I was on the phone to at that time. She then told me she was putting me through to her manager because I'd apparently said I didn't want to talk to her and she wasn't being helpful. I tried explaining that that is not what I was saying, that I was saying I struggle emotionally speaking to anyone on the one so speaking to someone on the phone and then having maybe minute to prepare and leave my house to get to an appointment was not something I could emotionally cope with. She transferred me anyway. Her manager then went over everything again (by this point I was shaking and extremely panicy). She then questioned weather I had anyone to look after my children/take them to school and suggested childminders, family or friend. I said I had no one childcare wise. She then tried offering me weekends when I'd already said i had no child care and had requested during school times because it couldn't be discussed around my children (issues with my vagin caused by childhood sexual abuse). She did then offer me an appointment at a time and day I could get to however said that she could over ride the system this once but as I am a one of case it wasn't something they were generally aloud to do. That they have to go with the normal census. I then said that no single parent would be able to get to the times they are aloud to give out (9am) and that actually alot of people struggle communicating on the phone and have anxiety issues, that I didn't appreciate that nothing was put in place for people like myself and that I personally think the first lady I'd spoken to was rather rude for someone who should have shown an understanding for mental health needs (in the same was as they show consideration for people with other kids of disabilities). She continued to state that they have to go with the norm and that her colleague had tried everything she could and that id got my appointment hadnt i. I asked how to complain and put the phone down. I then had an anxiety attack that lasted 20 minutes (while trying to look after two children). I have then spent the rest of the day so far numb and dissociation. I don't appreciate being made to feel liken an anomaly and an inconvenience. It makes me want to apologise for having mental health and that's not how contacting your doctors should make you feel.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-08-24T14:47:09","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-08-25T07:31:41","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/969605","id":"969605"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/969605/responses","id":"969605"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/969605/healthservices","id":"969605"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/969605/tags","id":"969605"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/c83023","id":"C83023","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/inconvenience","id":"inconvenience"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/abuse","id":"abuse"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/normal","id":"normal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happy","id":"happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/struggling","id":"struggling"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20happy","id":"not happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20happy","id":"very happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/like%20myself","id":"like myself"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/972420","id":"972420"}]},{"id":968966,"author":"Emmgh49","authorRoleId":8,"authorRole":"a staff member posting for a patient/service user","title":"The care I received has been brilliant","body":"I have been on this ward since Monday and the care I received has been brilliant, the nursing staff are taking great care of me I couldn’t be happier.

I was seen by another gynae doctor at 7:00 am and told I needed an ultrasound because I could have ovarian torsion. It wasn’t until 2:00pm that I was told the scan wouldn’t be until 10:00am the following morning.  \r\nI was told I could eat and was given a sandwich as I had missed the lunch due to being nil by mouth. The next morning at 10:00am I had my ultrasound and was told I had a normal cyst on my ovary and could be discharged. I waited until 2:00pm and still hadn’t been discharged and had only eaten 2 sandwiches in 48hours. I was ultimately kept in hospital for 2 nights and 3 nearly full days to be told there wasn’t a cause for my abdominal pain. Why couldn’t that ultrasound have been done in A&E? no wonder the NHS is on its knees when I could have been sent home 48hours earlier.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-08-22T18:23:59.8233333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-08-25T07:47:29.987","readBy":[{"name":"United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust","count":11}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/968703","id":"968703"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/968703/responses","id":"968703"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/968703/healthservices","id":"968703"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/968703/tags","id":"968703"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rwdda_180","id":"RWDDA_180","score":1},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rwdda_502","id":"RWDDA_502","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rwdda-xray","id":"rwdda-xray","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frustrated","id":"frustrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/abdominal","id":"abdominal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/accident%20&%20emergency","id":"accident & emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ct","id":"ct"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ct%20scan","id":"CT scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cyst","id":"cyst"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/drip","id":"drip"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/food","id":"food"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gynae","id":"gynae"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/long%20wait","id":"long wait"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ovarian","id":"ovarian"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ovary","id":"ovary"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/procedures","id":"procedures"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scan","id":"scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ultrasound","id":"ultrasound"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/delays","id":"delays"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/969652","id":"969652"}]},{"id":968976,"author":"Matdw53","authorRoleId":8,"authorRole":"a staff member posting for a patient/service user","title":"Staff couldn't do enough","body":"The care that I have got in Trauma Ward has been absolutely excellent so far and there isn’t a bad word that I could say about it.

The reception team are extremely unhelpful to the point of uncooperative.\n\nI have been helping my daughter sort out an appointment for a urine infection.  She called, as requested, first thing this morning and managed to get an appointment with a doctor who was extremely helpful and asked her to take in a urine sample immediately, which she did.   The doctor said she would call her at 1pm with the results of a dip test. 1pm came and went, so my daughter called this afternoon and was told by reception that she would have to wait 48 hours for test results, bearing in mind we have the long weekend ahead of us.  When I got in from work we decided to go to the surgery and find out if my daughter could find out what the results were and hopefully get some antibiotics as she was in a lot of pain and discomfort, but we were told we would have to wait for the results, or call again tomorrow morning at 8am or 12.30pm for another appointment.  We explained that my daughter works in a shop and had to work tomorrow - a long shift covering the hours of the opening hours of the surgery.  The answer was 'If you were that unwell you wouldn't be going to work'  A totally unacceptable way to speak to a young person.  Not everyone has all the time in the world to make appointments in person or hang on the phone for what seems like hours. \n\nEventually, after a lot of discussion between us and the receptionist, we were told that a note would be left for the doctor. She actually called within half an hour and apologised. Apparently the urine sample had not been given to her and therefore had not even been tested.  All of this conversation was being heard by other patients in the waiting room.  No confidentiality at all. \n\nI haven't even got to the blood test results my daughter is waiting for ... initially another 2 week wait for results and after almost begging, now just over a week.  Absolutely disgraceful.\n\nThe lovely doctor's practice I have been a patient of for 55 years is a shambles.\n\nPlease, please do something about this awful situation to help your loyal patients.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-08-24T19:45:31","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2022-08-25T08:03:04","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/969618","id":"969618"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/969618/responses","id":"969618"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/969618/healthservices","id":"969618"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/969618/tags","id":"969618"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/h81071","id":"H81071","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disgraceful","id":"Disgraceful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/antibiotics","id":"antibiotics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood","id":"blood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20test","id":"blood test"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/heard","id":"heard"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/in%20pain","id":"in pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/infection","id":"infection"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/test","id":"test"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unacceptable","id":"unacceptable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20great","id":"not great"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/like%20myself","id":"like myself"}]},{"id":969623,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Above and beyond ","body":"Since having my two daughters (first in 2018 and second earlier this year in Feb 22) I have always been so thoroughly impressed (and grateful!) for the level of care, professionalism and dedication shown by all staff at this practice. \nThe reception staff are incredibly helpful and accommodating, and even the dreaded 8am phone calls for an appointment are never too stressful, the queues are tackled quickly and appointments made available.

This need was not met.  \r\nTo further this, the Gosport service managed to forget to hand me my prescription on the day of a reduction, causing me a massive amount of hassle and anxiety.  \r\nThe goalposts keep moving but my work stays the same.

We had been there half an hour when my husband asked Janice, the nurse, to have a quick look at my leg because it was an open wound. Without any hesitation, she came and looked at it and decided it needed a dressing on it, just in case there might be any infection in the atmosphere in the waiting room.  \r\nRegardless of how busy she was, she did it immediately. After a wait of about one and a half hours, I was seen in the treatment room. The care I received was second to none.

The pharmacist and physio who saw me post-op and helped me get back home quickly.  \r\nThat evening I had a bleed and phoned Ward 25, where staff nurse Sinead spent time reassuring me in a hilarious chat before suggesting a plan. There was a further six calls between us which only finished when she knew I was being treated by kind, empathetic A&E staff - in particular Dr Lim who came from Ward 25, who after attending to me lined my boot with plastic so the new bandages would not get stained. A charming, easy manner and his skill again gave me reassurance.  \r\nI am also grateful for the pre and post-op care I have received with Amanda and her team in Outpatients 3, who spent time giving care to both my foot and me as a whole.  \r\nIn short I am so impressed and grateful for the skill of my surgeon Mr Gibson and his team, but it’s much more.

A couple of years later I lost my mother which broke my heart for the second time. I lived at home with them and had been their main carer which had been incredibly stressful and lonely and there was no light at the end of the tunnel, only death. As well as feeling isolated and depressed I became angry and felt abandoned by the rest of my family, I was left to carry the burden while their lives carried on as usual. My mother suffered from dementia and could be difficult.  \r\nI was living in a bubble, I didn't go anywhere, I didn't socialise, I rarely saw friends, I felt drained all the time, I was mentally exhausted. I found it hard to concentrate, I would start things and never finish them, I became prone to angry outbursts where I would be consumed with rage, sometimes saying and doing things I would later regret. I would binge drink on Saturday nights, my one release as I saw it. My physical health suffered and I lost interest in hobbies I had been involved with most of my life, my life was in limbo. When my mother passed away I felt like a rudderless ship adrift in a storm tossed ocean. I felt lost and still exhausted.  \r\nTwo weeks later I received a request from social services saying they had overpaid my mother and wanted the money back. Their insensitivity took my breath away. I never replied. My mental health didn't improve, I continued to live like a hermit and I would drink to excess when alone late at night, always becoming emotional. In stressful situations I would in an instant become aggressive and ready to be violent. It was like I lost control and rage would take over.  \r\nI knew I had a problem but I would never talk to family or friends about it so one day I phoned my health centre. I didn't even want to speak to my own doctor so I spoke to another one on the phone. A day later my doctor rang me and we talked. They offered medication but I don't take pills if at all possible so he said he would arrange someone to get in touch within the month. No one did.  \r\nBy this time I was on Universal Credit and had become friendly with my liaison. He offered to refer me to the Condition Management programme and a few weeks later I was contacted by one of their staff. We met once but most meetings were conducted via Zoom. A couple of times I felt it was a bit of a box-ticking exercise but I liked my contact and it was a great relief to be able to talk to someone about how I felt as I had never opened up to anyone before, and I felt like they really cared.  \r\nI started to train again, as I have trained most of my life, and that helped me feel better and I started working on a book which had been postponed for a long time. Then one day I discovered Wim Hof, a remarkable man. I started doing his breathing and cold exposure techniques and felt so much better. He has developed his system over the years to improve all aspects of health but initially it was to help him cope with his own heartbreak when his wife committed suicide. I practiced his techniques for a couple of weeks and then signed up for a 10 week course to dive deeper into his methods and am thoroughly enjoying it.  \r\nI feel better both physically and mentally, (I am calmer).
