I was at the lowest point in my life i had ever been and had serious contemplations about ending my life.  \r\nMy keyworker told me that she was referring me back to be put back into structured recovery and i would have a new keyworker. At that time i felt a sense of relief that i was going to get help and my worries and fears were going to heard without judgement, as they were when i first joined ORB.  \r\nI couldn't have been more wrong. I continuously contacted ORB trying to get in touch with my new keyworker and was told I had been assigned to a worker. I contacted them only to be told that it was them, but at the last minute i had to assigned to a different keyworker.  \r\nI continued with my efforts to reach out as i knew i was getting worse and i was becoming even more anxious and my mental health was taking a very quick and serious plunge towards complete desperation. So finally after 2 and a half weeks of waiting and in between being sectioned, my keyworker contacted me only to tell me i would have to wait another week and a half before they could have the time to have a session and start work on a recovery plan with me. I'm still waiting.  \r\nI can honestly say that i feel while working with ORB and I was clean and engaging to a very high level, doing up to 6 online groups a week ORB couldn't have done more for me. But when i found myself in a dark place and full of anxiety and depression and fear ORB, in my opinion, let me down massively.  \r\nIt pains me to type those words as i had always had great faith in them.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-02-22T12:21:06.21","progress":"Change planned","dateOfPublication":"2021-02-25T09:20:00.257","readBy":[{"name":"Midlands Partnership NHS Foundation Trust","count":3},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2021)","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/826161","id":"826161"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/826161/responses","id":"826161"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/826161/healthservices","id":"826161"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/826161/tags","id":"826161"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rrex4-buckinghamshire-wycombe","id":"rrex4-buckinghamshire-wycombe","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxious","id":"anxious"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fear","id":"fear"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helpless","id":"helpless"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/alcohol","id":"alcohol"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cocaine","id":"cocaine"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/depression","id":"depression"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/despair","id":"despair"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/keyworker","id":"keyworker"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lack%20of%20support","id":"lack of support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sectioned","id":"sectioned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/827323","id":"827323"}]},{"id":826264,"author":"Sams","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Upset by a rude member of staff","body":"I was admitted to Lincoln hospital as an emergency patient because of pregnancy dehydration.  \r\nA member of staff asking questions was so rude.

My appointment was at 1300, so got there at 1245 to allow time to do a urine sample etc. There was no one at reception when I arrived and the blinds were closed with a sign saying \"at lunch - sorry for the inconvenience\". Eventually someone came in around 1305 and checked me in. 5-10 mins later two more receptionists walked in. So three people  working at reception in an otherwise empty clinic, but none of them could be there on time to ensure they are available to check in patients with appointments? If a patient had arrived that late, they probably would have been turned away. The receptionist at the front desk then proceeded to have a very loud personal conversation on the phone, which she did not stop when another pregnant patient walked in and tried to check in. She had to go and sit down and wait to be acknowledged. I found the receptionists behaviour extremely rude and unprofessional. What's worse is this is clearly not a one-off. I had a similar experience a few months ago - my appointment was at 1415 and again there was a sign saying \"at lunch\". There were two of us waiting to be seen. Midwife eventually had the sense to come out and look for us, saying she nearly put us down as \"did not attend\" as she didn't know we were there. Not sure how that is our fault as there is no bell to ring to get someone's attention when reception is closed and despite me knocking on the door and calling out, no one came to assist. It is the responsibility of this clinic to sure there is a member of staff available to check patients in at their allocated appointment times.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2021-01-27T15:39:31","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2021-02-25T10:37:19","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/827313","id":"827313"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/827313/responses","id":"827313"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/827313/healthservices","id":"827313"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/827313/tags","id":"827313"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rj629","id":"RJ629","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/inconvenience","id":"inconvenience"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pregnant","id":"pregnant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"}]},{"id":827312,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Appalling","body":"When an appointment was made and not kept by the doctor.

The receptionists seem to think that their job is to make sure you can't see/speak to a doctor at all - and you only get nurse practitioners at best.  I think the word \"service\" seems to have passed this practice by - they forget that we pay for this service and that doctors are paid large salaries out of the public purse to provide this service.

And they can be really threatening, so for example, I need a monthly injection, but in the first month I was here they injected me 5 times. Its because it feels like its used as a sort of threat, to threaten patients into behaving. So yeah, that happened.  \r\nThey don't ask if I want it. They just show up at my door, right in my bedroom door, with a big gang of nurses and orderlies ready to restrain me. No asking whether I want it - I do want the injection, I try to say that I will take it willingly but they don't listen and I get it forcefully.  \r\nAnd the catering department - they often serve us out of date food - for example the puddings they give us, little plastic cups full of trifle, jelly, cheesecake, they have the date labelled on the top and it is usually out of date.  \r\nThe building itself is in a terrible condition, its been chopped and changed so many times. The windows have no curtains, just those office venetian blinds, so all the heat escapes out of the window and I end up freezing cold. And the en suites, the little shower cubicles we have, they have those swinging saloon doors that you can't lock - feels more like I'm in a cowboy movie and less like I am in a place where I can wash with any kind of privacy.  \r\nAnd we have locks on our bedroom doors, but it doesn't mean we have any kind of privacy.

We were able to forward on emails from friends, type our own emails & updates, include photos and pictures - send them into PALS who would then print them early the next day & deliver them to the ward, at no charge - although we would have happily paid. We always received an email receipt to say that our letter had been received and would be delivered which was very reassuring. PALS also assisted in arranging the delivery of fresh clothes & other items and the retrieval of laundry from their office - always friendly & smiling at a time of stress for us.  \r\nOur only comment would be that these services could have been advertised more widely on the main hospital website or even a direction on the information given on the telephone answering service as we only came across this by chance when trying to trace some post that hadnt reached the ward. We are sure that more patients & families would love to be making use of this brilliant service! Thankyou.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-02-24T22:13:25.05","progress":"Made change","dateOfPublication":"2021-02-25T13:51:42.233","readBy":[{"name":"Royal Devon University Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/827100","id":"827100"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/827100/responses","id":"827100"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/827100/healthservices","id":"827100"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/827100/tags","id":"827100"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rbz","id":"RBZ","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/advertising","id":"advertising"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/delighted","id":"delighted"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pals","id":"pals"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attitude","id":"staff attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassuring","id":"reassuring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/827435","id":"827435"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/831307","id":"831307"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/831385","id":"831385"}]},{"id":827379,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Outstanding service ","body":"Just wanted to say how amazing the whole team were from the Marshall at the entrance to sitting in the tent before I felt after having my covid Jab.\n\nThere was banter in the waiting room, which for me made it feel like we were all in this together.\nNurses were fabulous, infact everyone was.\n\n\nIt was quick, simple and very well set out.\n\nGuy's keep up the good work!\n\nYou should be extremely proud of yourself.\n\nWhat an outstanding team at Glenside.\n\nKind regards \n\nCharlotte Roberts ","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2021-02-25T11:40:29","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-02-25T13:56:33","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/827379","id":"827379"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/827379/responses","id":"827379"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/827379/healthservices","id":"827379"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/827379/tags","id":"827379"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l83100","id":"L83100","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good","id":"good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20good","id":"not good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing","id":"amazing"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/828101","id":"828101"}]},{"id":827378,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"great practice ","body":"I have been feeling unwell for some time and unfortunately the admin and one of the GPs at the practice proved to be an awful experience - i was made to feel that i wasnt getting anywhere... After several attempts at the e-consult, I eventually came across a lovely receptionist who took me under her wing and ensured i finally got a consultation with a  GP after 2 months of trying. \nShe booked an appointment for me and spoke to me initially on the morning of receiving the call to assure i would have a phone consultation later in the day, i appreciated this very much. The GP i spoke to was very caring, attentive and reassuring. She asked lots of questions and took my concerns on board without making me feel rushed for time or dismissing my concerns (as i had previously experienced with the other GP and some admin staff) She recommended some further investigations and her calm and patient demeanour made me feel so much better. \nSoon after having the consultation, the receptionist who booked the appointment for me called me to ask if everything went ok. I was so pleasantly surprised to receive this call and really appreciated her concern.I just wish i hadn’t been through the awful 2 months of trying to speak to someone who would listen.. perhaps it’s a reflection of the pandemic and the stress that frontline staff are under, i wholeheartedly empathise as i am also a keyworker and the recent crisis has brought its own set of challenges. However, it is really important to not neglect the fact that individuals who are experiencing health issues should be given the quality care respect and dignity (which thankfully i eventually received ) that they deserve.

I live several hours away and due to childcare I had to bring my toddler with me. We arrived at the hospice and was immediately met with kindness and empathy. Throughout my dad’s final days he was treated with absolute dignity. The staff were supportive, friendly and even provided toys to keep my little one occupied.  \r\nEvery single staff member we encountered showed us kindness in our darkest moments - from the receptionist, the kitchen staff, the nurses and doctors. We were given lots of space as a family to just ‘be’ with my dad but at any point that we were worried or frightened they helped to support all of us.  \r\nWe had the family room which allowed me to stay in the hospice and be with my dad as he passed. It is the saddest moment of my life but I am so grateful to have been with him and to know that his final moments were with the ones he loved. The kindness of the staff after this happened is something that will always stay with me. My dad had so many years left to live and whilst we will never come to terms with his loss, I am grateful he was at St Mary’s. Thank you. It will never be enough.
