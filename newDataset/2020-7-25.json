Due to Covid, most of the checks have been included as part of the scans you attend so you don’t have to attend multiple times. I was made to wait 45 minutes for nothing only to be told by a midwife that it was my fault for waiting around as the midwives had already seen me before my scan. I explained that a midwife told me specifically that further blood tests would be carried out for me at the 20 weeks mark & the sonographer checked they would see me before handing over my care to them. It’s a shame that the staff member automatically assumed that I was in the wrong and was wrongly advised, even though it was a midwife from her team who told me this. I understand waiting times can be long, however I patiently waited until the midwife saw me, only to be made feel as if I know nothing? Patients do understand their care pathways & are more up to date about it then some staff members. I think the midwife should also be aware that certain members of the public may also have a better understanding of their care especially if they work in a similar environment. Assumptions shouldn’t be made that we don’t understand what’s happening to us. What should have been an exciting day for me was ruined by certain comments made by staff. It should be made clear from the start what checks patients will have on that day. I also found it inappropriate that this whole conversation had to happen in the waiting area, as several other patients could overhear the whole conversation. I could’ve easily been taken around the corner, so we could have had this conversation in the hallway away from other patients. I felt I had to justify their wrongful actions, even though it wasn’t my fault for waiting around. The waiting isn’t the main issue; it was the fact that the midwife made me feel so little in front of others as if I didn’t know what was happening to me. From a patient’s prospective, it was the incompetency of the department for making a patient wait in a waiting room with others for no apparent reason. The information given to patients should be consistent too.

Masks on / off for sometime so much so that other patients waiting outside commented on how unprofessional it all was. At least 2 pharmacists appeared to work flat out trying to avoid the celebrating group. There were hundreds of prescriptions stacked up on the counters which added to the chaos. Also two nurses came in for a bag of Made up scripts Then stood at counter sorting out which ones each wanted.

From my initial phone call to them to my discharge, I was shown nothing but kindness, compassion and a total lack of judgement for my situation. Unfortunately due to COVID, it wasn’t possible to bring someone with me for support when I attended the clinic for the procedure which was very upsetting when I first arrived. In all I was there for around 4hrs - 2 waiting, being scanned and speaking to nurses, 2 for the procedure and recovery. I was absolutely terrified when I first was called to theatre but each member of staff took the time to introduce themselves to me and reassured me that they would take care of me. Someone was holding my hand when I was put to sleep and someone was there when I woke up. I was never left feeling alone. 20 mins or so later I was wheeled up to recovery where I was able to have a biscuit and a drink, and have my obs taken. Again the staff were lovely and very professional when I felt so vulnerable. I hope I don’t ever need to use this invaluable service again, but if you should ever find yourself in need, the staff here will take excellent care of you and you will be shown nothing but respect and compassion whatever your circumstance.

I was in severe pain and was admitted in really fast. They took my blood pressure and all other tests almost immediately. I was also offered to take ultrasound scans to investigate properly into cause of my pain (which helped a lot to identify the problem and make a correct diagnosis... something I struggled with for months, visiting numerous doctors). Everyone was very professional but above all, very warm and sympathetic too, beginning from my lovely doctor as well as the nurses and finally, the ultrasound team who were very knowledgable and helped to find out what was wrong. I've been given painkillers and also regularly checked on. The amount of work these people do everyday is insane, yet they stay calm, professional and approachable too. I wanted to learn more about my condition and further treatment options so the doctor took all the time necessary to patiently respond all of my questions and concerns.

However there is ONLY ONE member of staff that actually does help and actually does stay on the call even if a little more time is needed and also does provide that support regardless of whether its helping the person or not. \nBut the rest have no clue on what they’re doing and it’s disgusting as I would expect this service to provide help/support for people that are in distress whether if it’s acute or not!! This service is for mental health, but unfortunately when you ring up all they advise is that having a cup of tea will fix all the problems. I am disgusted that my confidentially was disclosed when I had made them aware on multiple occasion that I do not wish for them to share any information regarding myself other than relevant services - Police/ambulance etc.... \nIt’s very hard on gaining trust with people these days, But because of having such bad experience where my personal information was disclosed and also having a member of staff talking to you like they own you is appalling.. I’m shocked and ashamed of reaching out to first response for any mental health support that I have been needing as they have only just made it worse for me and that is me losing trust with this service.... I personally DO NOT think that this was an appropriate. I have a lot of trust issues. For me it’s very hard to trust somebody NOW Having first response disclosing my information that Shouldn’t of been disclosed in the first place as I had told them that numerous of times. Yes this has deteriorated my mental health as I have given up on services like this. CQC Need to look into matters like this, Most of the staff behind that desk have no care in them and no clue on how to provide support.  I really do wonder how they were given this JOB ROLE? \nUnfortunately this whole situation has affected my well being even more. I hope you can view my point from my perspective.  All staff at first response need on going training. As the service is unprofessional and they FOB you off HOW DARE!

She could not sleep and became delusional. We did not know what to do her doctor was unreachable, so we called 111 many times on the day and night trying to get some help, but only promises to send an ambulance, that never came when we needed it. In the early hours of the following morning 111 called us back to tell us to leave until the morning and to contact her GP. After about 2 hours we were expecting no one we were trying to sleep, then two ambulance staff were at our door. They were very nice but as they arrived my daughter got more agitated. After some conversation, we took a decision that later we would regret, to allow her to go with them and her husband to the Croydon University Hospital and stay at the emergency ward. Big mistake.  \r\nThey took her to a room that contained a telephone, a computer and a life support machine, gas cylinder for the bed, oxygen pipes, door lock from the inside, a toilet and shower. A sink and tap in the bedroom as well. A completely inappropriate place at a busy A&E unit. A lot of noise, and SILENCE is not practiced there and not even mentioned. Staff chatting loudly by the patient doors and some staff members who seemed to be laughing at my daughter’s behaviour.  \r\nThe unit is made in a very inadequate way. It is like a call centre. Surrounded by rooms for patients. Very disorganized and no one tells you who is in charge or whom to talk to in case of any need. I felt that staff we encountered were badly trained staff and some badly tempered.  \r\nMale patients in the mental health unit were let at loose at the unit, going into the other patient rooms, obviously unattended and I saw patients walking outside the unit at 3 am. Easily could have resulted in something bad to a female vulnerable patient. No cameras were seen at the unit to supervise anything.  \r\nVery low tolerance to mental health family members who are not used to this environment and easily are put out the unit by the place that incredibly has a manager. The mental health patient is allowed to wander around without being disturbed. They do not let the patient family members know their rights. I feel that they are dishonest or are not in control of the unit. They say they have a mental health team there, but every day seems to be a different person in charge and no results or progress is made. The patient deteriorates and even the proper medication is not given. My daughter who refuses to take any pills did not have an alternative treatment for her illness there where she stayed for 3 days.  \r\nThey basically kept her under sedation at a dosage that I feel could have been dangerous and subject to reaction to different sedatives.  \r\nNo one offered the family member a form to fill up to tell how the experience at the hospital was, the only thing they said when the patient family member got desperate to get some information was to complain to the PAL’s team. Zero empathy. They mistakenly told us that my daughter was detained under section 2 even though the papers were not complete. The mental health act section 2 say that they have to assess the case and treat the patient. None of that really happened, because they seem to lack medication, facility and trained personnel. I would never ever take a mental health relative to any A&E again, I would go straight to a mental health hospital because as they say the patient as soon as they get to A&E they will be \"under arrest\", they cannot turn them back.  \r\nThree days at that unit in the Croydon University Hospital. Three days nightmare, humiliation, suffering from the patient, three days without eating and drinking properly, only one time given liquids through the vein, suffering to the family members, lack of empathy by the management, lack of humanity, lack of professionalism and putting the patient against the family member in this NHS culture there is of ignoring the parents of the patient.  \r\nPerhaps we all are the victims, but they are the ones to change it. Less false heroes, less arrogance and more professionalism, please.  \r\nWhen my daughter was leaving the unit after three days and she was taken to the transportation car I saw the monstrous face of the mental health system.

A single sandwich would be adequate, the home-made soup was delicious and fresh fruit would have been appreciated.","criticality":"minimally critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-07-25T15:12:49.1533333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-07-27T11:00:00.947","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Tayside","count":15},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/777992","id":"777992"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/777992/responses","id":"777992"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/777992/healthservices","id":"777992"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/777992/tags","id":"777992"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/t101h_100","id":"T101H_100","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/t101h-acute-surgical","id":"t101h-acute-surgical","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20tests","id":"blood tests"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/empathy","id":"empathy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/excellent%20staff","id":"excellent staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nice%20food","id":"nice food"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/patient%20empathy","id":"patient empathy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tests","id":"tests"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/x-rays","id":"x-rays"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appreciated","id":"appreciated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassion","id":"compassion"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gratitude","id":"gratitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/clear%20explanations","id":"clear explanations"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/782810","id":"782810"}]},{"id":777903,"author":"Jim5571","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Help I needed","body":"I was struggling with pain to my back and knees and low and behold I got addicted to prescription pain killers, which was also a pain, and I didn't know what to do and where to turn, this was effecting my marriage my home life and my work, after receiving guidance from a friend on where to go for help.  \r\nI contacted Pathways they were very professional from the start, I received the help I needed and life now is looking good, if this option wasn't available I dont know what would of happened","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-07-24T16:46:28.1833333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-07-27T11:01:12.333","readBy":[{"name":"Change Grow Live","count":4}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/777903","id":"777903"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/777903/responses","id":"777903"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/777903/healthservices","id":"777903"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/777903/tags","id":"777903"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/nms-pathways-to-recovery-warrington","id":"nms-pathways-to-recovery-warrington","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/addicted","id":"addicted"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back%20pain","id":"back pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good","id":"good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professional","id":"professional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/the%20service","id":"The service"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/778135","id":"778135"}]},{"id":777926,"author":"Paul vol","authorRoleId":10,"authorRole":"a volunteer/advocate","title":"Meditation group","body":"I’ve been attending the meditation group every Friday that is being run by Amanda.

This was at 10.30 am my wife took me to A&E at New Cross were treatment began immediately.  I was assessed, X-rayed and in no time at all the Consultant Orthopaedic Surgeon examined me and indicated that, if I was OK with local anaesthetic, he would carry out the operation immediately.  I agreed and he completed the operation backed by his team.  The Consultant’s professional, confident, reassuring, friendly and jovial approach totally relaxed me and a took away my apprehension. The operation, in my opinion, was completed very quickly causing me no pain or discomfort whatsoever.  A member of Consultant’s team told me that I had been unlucky to have the accident but very lucky to have this particular Consultant to carry out the operation as he is a true expert in his field, which I can agree with wholeheartedly.  Everything went like clockwork; quickly and efficiently.  As stated, the accident was at 10.30am and I was back at home by 2.30pm which included one hours travelling time.  I would say that it would be impossible to get better treatment or service anywhere.\n\nThe follow up service that I received at the nurse led orthopaedic clinic was also first class, friendly, professional and reassuring.  When I was about to be discharged I had further indication of the high esteem in which the Consultant is held; the nurse in charge said he is fantastic.  The nurse was right, he was there as soon as the bandages were off.  He examined my thumb and, as with the operation, his manner was very friendly, professional and reassuring.  I was relieved to be told that the thumb was healing well and that I could be discharged.  \n\nIn all I can honestly say that every member of staff at New Cross that I met were absolutely first-class, demonstrating outstanding commitment to duty particularly when you take into account that we are in the midst of a pandemic.

On Friday night I had to go in for severe pain. As soon as I arrived at the maternity ward all of the staff on triage was extremely helpful and reassuring! They talked me through everything that was happening, gave me plenty of reassurance that my baby was okay and did everything they could to help me feel settled and looked after. I then was moved onto M2 where the midwives and doctors where just as amazing. Day and night they was always on hand with a friendly face and did everything they could of make the experience less scary and more relaxing for me. When I needed pain relief or any scans they explained it fully to me so I understood what it was and why I needed it. Even when I was just feeling a bit down and worried about my baby they was there to have a chat with and Just made me feel like I wasn’t alone. Absolutely amazing service from start to finish and definitely made me feel more at ease about going in for labour! One student midwife in particular (I can’t remember her name but she is originally from Bassetlaw) was amazing. Super friendly and helpful and even when she was just going around doing observations she would sit and talk to me and have a friendly chat. Made me feel like I had a friend I could talk to a smiley friendly face really does make any experience more comforting.
