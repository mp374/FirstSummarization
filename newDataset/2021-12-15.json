My cancer is incurable with a median life expectancy of 2 to 3 years. I am on treatment at present and attend the Cancer Centre for chemotherapy every three weeks.  \r\nThe cancer itself, the treatments and their side effects, and the regular scanning are all quite demanding and debilitating.  \r\nI attend CT Imaging every three months to assess if my palliative treatment is working and keeping my cancer stable. As you can imagine this is a hugely stressful routine as I manage my life from one three monthly scan to the next. News of a stable scan allows me to live my best life possible for the following months until the next scan. I am not an anxious person and am very positive, having sought out many interventions to keep me positive and well, both physically and mentally, however scaniexty is a real issue.  \r\nMy Cancer Nurse who supports Dr McAleer, June, and Majella, the CT Service Manager have been absolutely excellent in managing the scanning appointments and processes in a very professional, efficient and compassionate manner, and have reduced the scanxiety as much as possible.  \r\nJune organises my scans routinely at exactly the right time and I never have to chase them. Majella then organizes Infusional Services to access my portacath on the day of the scan so that my veins are saved as much as possible. The CT staff are extremely efficient - I have never experienced any delays in the two years that I have attended the Imaging Service. As well as being very efficient, there is no sense of a conveyor belt service with the patient feeling like a statistic in terms of numbers processed each day. The very opposite is true, with staff recognising me from previous appointments, taking an interest in my ongoing wellbeing and genuinely showing true compassionate care.  \r\nThe staff work as a team with Infusional Services and show a real interest in understanding how the potacath in my chest is accessed for CT contrast.  \r\nAs well as professional, safe, efficient and compassionate care shown during the scanning process, the Imaging Centre is a welcoming space for patients. Although small, it is extremely clean and well laid out with excellent notices for patients. There is a true ethos of listening to patients concerns and making service improvements that matter to patients. I previously noted that the waiting room was very cold in winter and very warm in summer and noticed that other patients had commented on this as it was clearly stated on the Care Opinion Notice Board, together with the corrective action taken. At my last visit the waiting area was indeed a much better temperature for patients.  \r\nThe appointment letters are also very informative and explain exactly what in involved in the scanning process; they offer help to patients if they need it and explain when and where patients need to go and what is required beforehand. Covid safety checks are also always undertaken which is reassuring for cancer patients who are immunosuppressed.  \r\nAll the above important aspects of a good patient experience do not happen by chance but are down to excellent leadership and a well-trained and caring team. Majella and her team provide an excellent service to patients day-in-day-out, and this makes a huge difference to patients such as myself who routinely attend hospital and for whom scanning means such a great deal in terms of our quality of life.  \r\nI am more than happy to give verbal feedback in addition to this written piece.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-12-13T12:37:40.6533333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-12-15T09:24:09.78","readBy":[{"name":"Belfast Health and Social Care Trust","count":9}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/902400","id":"902400"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/902400/responses","id":"902400"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/902400/healthservices","id":"902400"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/902400/tags","id":"902400"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt001_02020_810","id":"ZT001_02020_810","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breast%20cancer","id":"breast cancer"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/caring","id":"caring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/chemotherapy","id":"chemotherapy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassionate%20care","id":"compassionate care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ct","id":"ct"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/efficient","id":"efficient"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/excellent%20service","id":"excellent service"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/imaging","id":"imaging"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/palliative","id":"palliative"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/patient%20experience","id":"patient experience"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/positive","id":"positive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professional","id":"professional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scan","id":"scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/team%20work","id":"team work"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/welcoming","id":"welcoming"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20safe","id":"very safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid","id":"covid"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/infusion","id":"infusion"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/902987","id":"902987"}]},{"id":902962,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Fantastic staff","body":"I recently took my daughter to the emergency department after not being able to control her high temperature.

From start to finish I felt looked after, listened to and involved in the whole process. The midwives were nothing short of amazing. They managed to make me feel like I was in the safest possible hands but also like I was in full control of the situation. They were so knowledgeable, extremely professional, very friendly and genuinely caring. The environment was the perfect balance of professional and super clean and warm and welcoming. The facilities are fantastic. The entire staff couldn’t have done more for us during our time there. They didn’t just care for myself and my baby but my husband too, making sure he didn’t feel like I spare part but totally involved.  \r\nThis is my first baby and as usual you get all the horror stories and scaremongering. I knew a lot of people had been put off giving birth in a midwife unit because of the pain relief options or chance of being transferred to a hospital, but I can’t recommend it enough for a first time mum. I can honestly say that the care we received, not just during the labour but immediately after and in the weeks to follow has given us the best possible start we could have asked for as a family.  \r\nDuring my pregnancy I was given the impression by some that once your baby is here then the focus is only on them. I didn’t find this to be true in my experience, the midwives were so caring towards me, always asking how I was as well as asking about my baby. I had had very little experience of caring for a baby before having my own one and the midwives were so helpful, taking the time to help me with feeding and changing, offering tips and advice along the way. There was absolutely no judgment whatsoever and I felt like I could ask them anything.  \r\nThe experience as a whole was fantastic and I wouldn’t hesitate for a second in recommending Inverurie Community Maternity Unit.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-12-13T13:19:15.22","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-12-15T10:01:40.75","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Grampian","count":4}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/902415","id":"902415"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/902415/responses","id":"902415"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/902415/healthservices","id":"902415"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/902415/tags","id":"902415"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/n331h-midwifery","id":"N331H-midwifery","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/aftercare","id":"aftercare"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing%20staff","id":"amazing staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/birth","id":"birth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cleanliness","id":"cleanliness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/facilities","id":"facilities"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/giving%20birth","id":"giving birth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/great%20experience","id":"Great experience"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/involved","id":"involved"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/knowledgeable","id":"knowledgeable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/labour","id":"labour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/maternity","id":"maternity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/midwives","id":"midwives"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/non%20judgemental","id":"non judgemental"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pregnancy","id":"pregnancy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professional","id":"professional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/safe","id":"safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20for","id":"cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/listened%20to","id":"listened to"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/902994","id":"902994"}]},{"id":902983,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Excellent Staff","body":"I have been a patient at Welcome Practice for 11 years.

It took me a while to realise the difference between nurses and health care assistants as each was as professional and caring as the other. I was assisted in every way I needed physically. Aaron was an absolute star and I have encountered him on each return stay. His kind, friendly and caring attitude has never changed. I hear him speak to other patients and he is a real down to earth, comforting person.  \r\nThere are way too many nurses to mention but the ones who stand out in my mind are Sijy, a lovely lady who was professional, kind and very caring. Rose, who looked after me for most of my first stay, such a smiley (despite the mask) and gentle person, and Judith who kept my family informed and reassured during a difficult time when I wasn’t able to communicate with them.  \r\nKaren from 6A also took great care of me on more recent stays and had a wonderful way with the student nurses. She had a lot of time and knowledge to share. I am sure that they will do well under her tuition. I’ve also had many visits to the SAMS clinic at the Royal and been looked after by some amazing and experienced nurses like Mary, Anna, Lisa and Michele, as well as the numerous consultants I’ve seen there.

My father is in his 90s and fell at home; we called an ambulance and he was taken to Stoke Mandeville Hospital. The good news is that in less than 24 hours he was discharged, very sore and bruised but with nothing broken. Most of the staff I talked to were fantastic however the way everything is organised and managed is shambolic. I seriously wonder if there is anyone managing this hospital.  \r\nI was told to call A&E after 4 hours but, in my experience, they almost never answer the phone or the phone rings for 10 minutes and then ends the call with a message 'sorry no-one is available'. Over a period of 5 hours, starting at 08.30 in the morning, I rang 9 times and I only got through once. When I did I was immediately put on hold for 5 minutes as 'all the computer systems had gone down'. Answering a phone does not require a Doctor or Nurse, just an administrator to give the most basic information.  \r\nWhen you are trying to find information on an elderly parent this is really distressing. All I needed was some to tell me he had been admitted and was being assessed. Then I eventually got a call saying I could come and collect him, and there was a bizarre system which required me to queue with the A&E patients to say I was there and then wait with them until my father came out. In total I had to wait nearly an hour in this crowded area which seems to be a bit crazy given I was told he was ready and the current Covid situation.  \r\nThen when he did appear he was limping along on the arm of a nurse. I asked how he was expected to walk all the way to the car park and they said I could go and get my car and drive up to the A&E entrance which would have been crazy as it is a single lane being used uniquely by ambulances not to mention this would have required him climbing over the barrier specifically designed to prevent this. So they reluctantly went and got a wheelchair whilst both of us waited in the crowded A&E waiting area.  \r\nAt the end of August last year my father had to go to Wexham Park Hospital following a similar fall and we had a fantastic experience. I was called by a Doctor or Nurse several times during the 12 hours he was in the hospital and when he was discharged they told me to let them know when I arrived and to wait outside (to minimise the Covid risk). Then a porter wheeled him out and took him all the way to my car in the car park. I do understand that the NHS is under massive pressure due to Covid-19 and that all the staff are working incredibly hard but that was also the case last August. Stoke Mandeville appear to be creating problems due to poor management.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-12-13T21:08:14.8166667","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2021-12-15T12:55:03.357","readBy":[{"name":"Frimley Health NHS Foundation Trust","count":1},{"name":"Buckinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust","count":1},{"name":"Steve Baker's Office, MP for Wycombe","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/902537","id":"902537"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/902537/responses","id":"902537"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/902537/healthservices","id":"902537"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/902537/tags","id":"902537"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rdu50_180","id":"rdu50_180","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rxq02_180","id":"RXQ02_180","score":2},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/angry","id":"angry"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disappointed","id":"disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/accident%20&%20emergency","id":"accident & emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disorganised","id":"disorganised"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/elderly","id":"elderly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fall","id":"fall"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fantastic%20staff","id":"fantastic staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mismanagement","id":"mismanagement"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/poor%20discharge%20arrangements","id":"poor discharge arrangements"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/telephone%20answering","id":"telephone answering"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wheelchair","id":"wheelchair"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication%20with%20family","id":"communication with family"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%2019","id":"covid 19"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/long%20queue","id":"long queue"}]},{"id":902597,"author":"Nath1985","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Alcohol abuse and recovery.","body":"A year ago I was having to be carried down the stairs of my sisters' house with the most extreme nausea and uncontrollable shaking. I felt like I was going to die. This is not an exaggeration. I had my last 25ml shot of vodka roughly about 6 hours before. I was just about to start my detox.  \r\nIt got bad, really bad. I couldn’t go any more than a few hours without needing a drink and I would drink anything. However Vodka was the main poison of choice, it was easy to conceal and cheap. Well that’s what I had been telling myself for years anyway. I was drinking between 1 to 1.5 litres of it a day and that’s not including the added beers, wine, ciders, cocktail cans alongside. I would fill up a water bottle for the commute to work or just to carry on me throughout the day. In the very early hours of the morning I would find myself on the toilet with the bottle of poison next to me, drinking enough to either attempt to go about my day the best I could or go back to sleep on the sofa for a few hours. It was a very frightening and solitary existence.  \r\nOn paper I had no reason to be this way, I had a loving girlfriend, secure job and a comfortable roof over my head. However, clearly something wasn’t right. What that something was didn't matter at this moment in time, I just knew something had to change.  \r\nMy physical and mental health had deteriorated immensely , it really was a case of do something now or die. Again no exaggeration there.  \r\nSo i reached out to my older sister for help and that's when we decided to get in contact with Inclusion.  \r\nAlthough not the easiest of times due to COVID restrictions, I was able to participate in group sessions online of 'alcohol awareness' and 'acceptance and commitment therapy', along with regular one to one conversations with my recovery worker. Finally, I was ready (I didn’t feel ready) to start my detox at my sisters house, with her administrating the medication needed along with the absolutely amazing support from the nurses at Inclusion. I quite literally owe all of these people my life. With support after finishing the detox by attending the Inclusion Recovery Program, mentored by Andy, and One to One sessions with my recovery worker, Aaron, they’ve given me the mental tools, focus and drive to get going with my life!  \r\nAnd a life is what I have now, not just an intense struggle to get through each hour or even minute of the day. It is in no way by any means perfect or without its difficulties. However In this one year since my detox I have bought a house with my partner, been to two weddings (sober!), maintained my job role with more energy and bought some home studio recording equipment with the money I would’ve otherwise lost to booze.  \r\nWith Inclusions brilliant recovery workers/nurses and the support network around me I am now able to positively go forward in my life, in sobriety.

This has lead to me running out of medication several times just from trying to get through on the phone for a prescription!\n\nI see the practice manager replies to bad reviews on here asking the person to get in touch, but doesn't give any contact details. How would we get in touch when it's impossible to reach the practice by phone?","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2021-12-15T11:15:10","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-12-15T13:41:13","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/903041","id":"903041"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/903041/responses","id":"903041"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/903041/healthservices","id":"903041"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/903041/tags","id":"903041"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/k81021","id":"K81021","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/903482","id":"903482"}]},{"id":903042,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Confusing messages","body":"I called the practice yesterday to make an appointment to see a doctor (any doctor). I was told there were no appointments that day and to use the ‘Klinik’ access app. A doctor would telephone me ‘in 48 hours’ I explained I felt quite   ill. Was told again to use the app. So frustrating. I made an appointment to see a private GP the same day. Fortunately I could afford to do this. This morning, I received a text informing patients that the Klinik app has been turned off. Apparently, staff are focussing on Covid vaccination centres and the urgent care needs of patients. Who decides what is urgent? Should we phone with concerns that something might be urgent? Or wait until it actually is and telephone 999? I used to think the Pinn was great, but it is now so inaccessible - trying to make an appointment is so stressful. I quite understand the pressure staff are under, but other practices seem to be maintaining  GP services very well. If I am asked who my GP is, I have no idea. For some time I have had to see whoever is available, not a doctor I know and would like to see. The Pinn is too big. If you have a chronic condition and are in the system, the service is better. But if you simply want to see a doctor to discuss an acute condition that is causing pain or discomfort, but is probably not urgent, a timely appointment seems to be almost impossible. Do I now join a private GP practice? It is something I am reluctant to do, but will consider if access to a GP at the Pinn continues to be challenging and stressful.

You hear a lot about GPs not seeing people but that's really not my experience","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-12-14T11:20:30.28","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-12-15T14:31:32.643","readBy":[{"name":"Scottish Government","count":1},{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":3}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/902635","id":"902635"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/902635/responses","id":"902635"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/902635/healthservices","id":"902635"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/902635/tags","id":"902635"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sj9-general-practices","id":"sj9-general-practices","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctors","id":"doctors"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/efficient%20service","id":"efficient service"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gp%20surgery","id":"gp surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/receptionist","id":"receptionist"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/respected","id":"respected"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/seen%20quickly","id":"seen quickly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/telephone%20appointment","id":"telephone appointment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20for","id":"cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/face%20to%20face","id":"face to face"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/903292","id":"903292"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/903321","id":"903321"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/903365","id":"903365"}]},{"id":902638,"author":"ehay85","authorRoleId":3,"authorRole":"a parent/guardian","title":"Reassuring Speech & Language Therapy service","body":"My child attended speech & language therapy within the WHSCT ongoing from age 2, with Developmental Language Disorder. They have just been discharged from treatment. Within this time we met many therapists and attended multiple locations including Great James Street and Waterside. The service provided was always 100% with very dedicated staff who go out of their way to help.  \r\nInitially it was a very worrying time as we had never experienced a speech disorder before and didn’t know what the outcome would be or how long therapy would need to continue or if other interventions would be needed. Thankfully through school and the input of our SLT therapist our child was granted a place within Ebrington Primary School speech unit. This massively helped their progress and really brought them on, and after only one term they were able to return to mainstream class.  \r\nNow the treatment is complete and they are excelling every day, fitting in well with their peers. They have great friends and are participating well and confidently in class. It was always a big concern as to how this would pan out.  \r\nWe cannot fault the care provided by the speech and language department and everyone we met was so helpful. We always felt our child was in caring, capable hands. Many thanks to all the staff we have met on our journey and we have been given the reassurance that if we ever need help in the future it will be there.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-12-14T11:41:12.2933333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-12-15T14:52:14.12","readBy":[{"name":"Western Health and Social Care Trust","count":5},{"name":"Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists (RCSLT)","count":1},{"name":"Public Health Agency","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/902638","id":"902638"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/902638/responses","id":"902638"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/902638/healthservices","id":"902638"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/902638/tags","id":"902638"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt005_45020_ahp","id":"ZT005_45020_ahp","score":5},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt005_45021","id":"ZT005_45021","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/caring","id":"caring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dedicated%20staff","id":"dedicated staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/speech%20and%20language","id":"Speech and Language"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/capable","id":"capable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/over%20and%20above","id":"over and above"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/well%20taken%20care%20of","id":"well taken care of"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/904570","id":"904570"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/905068","id":"905068"}]},{"id":902641,"author":"squatek49","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Positive covid booster experience","body":"I was very anxious to get my booster asap with the number of covid cases rising so rapidly. I’m in the over 30 bracket so the only option was to come to a walk-in clinic. When I arrived the queue had about 70 people ahead of me. A daunting prospect with a 1 year old full of the cold awaiting my speedy arrival at home. But I committed. And I waited. But I needn’t have worried. The queue moved along so steadily. I was in the building within 35 minutes.  \r\nWhen I finally reached the front of the line - I was greeted by the kindest eyes behind the usual PPE. He informed me that his name was Gerry and indicated that he and his colleague at the computer would be helping me today. And I suddenly got very emotional. What a privilege to be able to walk in somewhere offering me this potentially life saving medicine…. administered by a trained professional…..for free?!?  \r\nI lost myself for a moment and garbled a \"thank you so much for what you are all doing. It really is appreciated. I’m sure you’re knackered….” through my mask. And then proceeded to fight back the tears as he gave me my booster jab and sent me on my way.  \r\nThank you so much to all the Gerrys working like crazy this December.
