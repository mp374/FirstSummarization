He ran into a glass door and pushed his tooth through the vermillion border of his upper lip splitting it straight through, rather unpleasant. I called Kidderminster minor injuries explained the injury and the said they could only send us to Worcester A and E which was a 50 minute drive away. \n\nFrom the moment we arrived at A and E we had an exemplary experience. The check in admin team were efficient. We only waited 10 minutes for the triage nurse, she was marvellous, very thorough and reassuring. Max-Fax was bleeped and they came to the rescue. They were confident, knowledgeable and a delight from start to finish. The work was extremely neat and they sorted us out in no time. \n\nI am a dentist and work in the NHS myself. I know the enormous pressure they are under at present and want to say a massive thank you and well done to your A and E team. I can’t sing your praises enough. You’re a credit to the profession!!

They then, very ignorantly, averted their eyes back to the computer screen and wouldn’t communicate any further. \n\nWe were put in one place by medical staff and then very rudely told to move by another, again, I just felt like an inconvenience despite only following staff instructions. \n\nWith wait times between 30 mins - 7.5hrs and no one able to tell me which applied to us, we left after 3 hrs. \n\nThankfully my family member is okay today and we aren’t local to Blackburn so should never have to visit A&E there again.

People had been there with emergency GP referrals which didn’t even fast track them as they sat alongside me as we went into the 10/12/15th hour of waiting... People literally left in tears because they were in so much pain and simply could not bear the wait any longer.  \r\n10am Wednesday morning, my name was finally called... trust me, I didn’t know I had the patience either lol.  \r\nAlthough my time lasted until the Friday evening after being admitted (I am okay now, but this isn’t the purpose of this post) which I totally was not expecting, I cannot commend the doctors and nurses enough! Because once you go through that door, the game changes... I said thank you to every one of these people at the time but thank you just didn’t seem a big enough way of showing my gratitude.  \r\n- To the doctor that seen me in A&E that knew something was definitely wrong and called the surgeon to check me out too.  \r\n- To the surgeon who also double checked me and recommended I stayed to get a procedure done or else I’d have to wait 2/3 months for it to happen.  \r\n- To the nurse in CDU who realised that I had been awake all night (being 2pm now) and immediately found a bed for me to lie down and sleep. You have no idea how significant this was, THANK YOU!  \r\n- To the nurse that came and hugged me and wiped away my tears when I totally freaked out going into theatre  \r\n- To everyone in theatre who explained everything and calmed me down before starting.  \r\n- To the doctor and nurses in Recovery who again reassured me and chatted to me even though they had 100 things going on around them and clearly under staffed  \r\n- To the nursing student in 4 South that literally made me (and my fellow roomies) laugh and smile so much , you will make an excellent nurse!  \r\n- To the two different nurses (one in A&E and one in 4 South) that took my blood. I hate needles and really don’t like it being done but these nurses were excellent, in and out before I could even pull a face! And didn’t tell me I should be used to it because I had a tattoo like other nurses do!  \r\n- To my fellow roomies (in both wards) for chatting and making it a little less lonely in there and also taking the mick out of mine and their own illnesses, because if you didn’t laugh, you’d cry in the words of one of them.  \r\n- To my amazing friends and family who came to visit, even those I didn’t expect, it meant so much!  \r\nSome of these people won’t remember me because I was only one in million as they endeavoured to see everyone. But when you are in hospital you don’t have very much to do (after your phone dies) but to sit and watch and observe. These people are absolute heroes and I cannot thank them enough! Sitting in an A&E I was probably calling them all sorts but they really are remarkable!  \r\nI can only imagine what that place is like because of recent events with Coronavirus. These doctors and nurses are heroes, remind them of this if you find yourself in there (I really hope you don’t though).  \r\nOur doctors and nurses deserve more. I pray for more for them, for our health service, for our country, for this world.  \r\nThis wasn’t a post to gain sympathy for myself (for those concerned, I am on the mend now), or scrutinise our health service but to highlight how amazing our doctors and nurses are, even in the small things! 🌟","criticality":"minimally critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-03-13T22:20:24.6466667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-03-16T11:42:00.92","readBy":[{"name":"Southern Health and Social Care Trust","count":11},{"name":"Public Health Agency","count":4},{"name":"Ulster University, MBBS (Medicine) 2021","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/748742","id":"748742"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/748742/responses","id":"748742"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/748742/healthservices","id":"748742"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/748742/tags","id":"748742"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_32024_100","id":"ZT003_32024_100","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_32024_180","id":"ZT003_32024_180","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood","id":"blood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/colonoscopy","id":"colonoscopy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctors","id":"doctors"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency","id":"emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/needles","id":"needles"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/student%20nurse","id":"student nurse"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tattoo","id":"tattoo"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/uncomfortable","id":"uncomfortable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting%20area","id":"waiting area"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ward%20staff","id":"ward staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gratitude","id":"gratitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/explanations","id":"explanations"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/a&e%20waiting%20times","id":"a&e waiting times"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/749559","id":"749559"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/753206","id":"753206"}]},{"id":748969,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Great Practice","body":"My family and I have been patients at this Surgery for 48 years and I can't recommend them enough.

My wife drove me to the Accident and Emergency Dept. in FVRH where I was seen promptly and admitted to the Surgical Admissions Unit and then B31 where I had excellent medical and nursing care.  \r\nI required 4 weeks I.V. Antibiotics but was able to be discharged after 5 days to attend the Outpatient Parenteral Antimicrobial Therapy Clinic(OPAT) from 04/02 to 01/03/2020. This service is a great development allowing me to go home instead of remaining in hospital which would have occurred in the past. I was also able for part of the time to self- administer the I.V antibiotic with the great support of the OPAT team -a new service they are developing. This saved me travelling and was very convenient.  \r\nThe OPAT team were always extremely helpful and very patient focused and did everything to make the procedure as comfortable as possible. Like the ward nurses they always had a smile on their faces which was welcomely therapeutic. I am now feeling much better and back to normal.  \r\nHopefully the service can be extended as not only does it save bed- days in hospital but is much more convenient for patients allowing them to recover in their own homes instead of having to remain in hospital.

This saves additional travel time going elsewhere. \n\nI am glad I registered with this practice five years ago.

They genuinely care and understand the patients needs.  \n \nThe reception staff are attentive and do their best with scheduling appointments at short notice.

We brought my son into a&e last weekend and found upon examination he had a dislocated elbow :( the paediatrician was wonderful and soon 'put him back together again' - we were happy and so was my son albeit very tired by this time, he was laughing again. A couple of days ago I was then called to say there would be a follow up appointment on monday (today), but she couldn't tell me the time from the system and just said it would tell me all i need to know in the letter that was being sent. Today - the day of the appointment I still have no letter. I have called the hospital and they have given me the time however it is far too short notice for me to make any work arrangements now . I tried to rearrange but again they could only give me a couple of days ahead and right in the middle of the day (1-3pm) . They couldn't do a morning, late afternoon or a weekend and unfortunately I cant just leave work at the drop of a hat as I dont work locally and my manager would need enough time to make other arrangements for someone else to cover my duties. I did query the question as to whether he needs the appointment or not as hes back to his usual self now anyway, or whether a more suitable appointment could be made at our gp surgery instead. They transferred me to the a&e department who then said they couldn't answer that for me and made me feel quite patronised - they said I would need to speak to orphadpedics (whom I was originally speaking to anyway and had transferred me!) They then had to put me back through to switchboard to pass me back to orphadpedics again. After being on hold for so long , I gave up and put the phone down. I assume they will just send me a new appointment in the post again? Hopefully I will receive this one in enough time but I may I suggest that your staff recognise that other people also work full time. I am left to feel guilty that I cant bring my  1 year old in for the appointment now even though we havent received the letter for it, i feel the people I spoke to over the phone weren't very understanding of my situation neither.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-03-16T12:57:53","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2020-03-16T13:00:41","readBy":[{"name":"United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust","count":13}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/748986","id":"748986"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/748986/responses","id":"748986"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/748986/healthservices","id":"748986"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/748986/tags","id":"748986"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rwdla","id":"RWDLA","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/patronised","id":"patronised"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dislocated","id":"dislocated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/elbow","id":"elbow"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good","id":"good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happy","id":"happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"}]},{"id":748975,"author":"Slicker58","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Great empathy with patients","body":"I have to give huge credit to Tom who is a Gynae oncologist, he is the most kindest caring professional I have came across.  \r\nHe has great empathy with his patients ...  \r\nFriendly manor  \r\nNothing is an issue he will go above and beyond.  \r\nI hope he gets recognition for his work as he thoroughly deserves it.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-03-16T12:32:35.7033333","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2020-03-16T13:05:30.9","readBy":[],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/748975","id":"748975"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/748975/responses","id":"748975"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/748975/healthservices","id":"748975"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/748975/tags","id":"748975"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rtk01_502","id":"RTK01_502","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/above%20and%20beyond","id":"above and beyond"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/brilliant","id":"brilliant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/caring","id":"caring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/empathy","id":"empathy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gynae","id":"gynae"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kind","id":"kind"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/oncologist","id":"oncologist"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professional","id":"professional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hope","id":"Hope"}]},{"id":748898,"author":"angel1882","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"A credit to their professions","body":"I would like to thank all the staff on the ward for the wonderful care my son and I received while we were in the ward.

We are very lucky to have our NHS and thanks to all the staff at the Royal Hospital for Children for their level of care.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-03-14T13:54:09.48","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-03-16T13:44:23.26","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Highland","count":3},{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":8},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/748877","id":"748877"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/748877/responses","id":"748877"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/748877/healthservices","id":"748877"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/748877/tags","id":"748877"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sj9-children-dental","id":"sj9-children-dental","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/day%20surgery","id":"day surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/informed","id":"informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/well%20looked%20after","id":"well looked after"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/relaxed","id":"relaxed"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/749156","id":"749156"}]},{"id":748867,"author":"B-2020","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Multiple cancellations","body":"So in October I found I’ve got a 7 year running of infection both markers are slightly raised.

Initially she was very poorly but thanks to A&E & HDU staff she rallied round after spending over a week in hospital. She was stepped down to a General Medicine ward before being discharged home.  \r\nSome thing you should know about my mum is that she is fully dependent on others to provide her care for her. This ranges from personal care, eating & drinking and mobilising.  \r\nOn packing her things prior to her discharge I noticed that the brand new tooth brush and tooth paste I had bought for her were still in the sealed packaging. I asked her if her teeth were brushed while she had been in hospital. She replied, no. While she was in HDU she was too unwell and I very much understood that as we (family & nurses) we’re giving her oral care with the pink sponges and cold water/ mouth wash. But since she was better not one person who had attended to her personal care needs had offered or asked if she wanted her teeth brushed.  \r\nMy mum gets her teeth brushed twice a day at home, like me and like most people who would’ve cared for her so I question why wasn’t her oral care attended to while in hospital? I know the importance of proper, good oral hygiene and how it can aid with positive patient outcomes. I am honestly appalled that this very basic need was not met when she was being washed and dressed or when getting ready for bed.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-03-14T21:18:43.7166667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-03-16T14:22:02.503","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Grampian","count":3},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/748891","id":"748891"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/748891/responses","id":"748891"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/748891/healthservices","id":"748891"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/748891/tags","id":"748891"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/n441h-elderly-medicine","id":"N441H-elderly-medicine","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appalled","id":"appalled"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20cared%20for","id":"not cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ashamed","id":"ashamed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dependent","id":"dependent"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disheartened","id":"disheartened"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/oral","id":"oral"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/time%20management","id":"time management"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/oral%20care","id":"Oral care"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/749028","id":"749028"}]},{"id":749001,"author":"skybz39","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Always treated with courteously","body":"I was seen by Dr Gemmill in cardiology.

I would say the actual medical service is very good, but the experience at the practice not always so good.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-03-16T15:48:59","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-03-16T16:07:39","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/749018","id":"749018"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/749018/responses","id":"749018"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/749018/healthservices","id":"749018"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/749018/tags","id":"749018"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/e87046","id":"E87046","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood","id":"blood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20test","id":"blood test"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good","id":"good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20valued","id":"Not valued"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/under%20valued","id":"under valued"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20satisfied","id":"very satisfied"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/welcome","id":"welcome"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/satisfied","id":"satisfied"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/valued","id":"valued"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/759534","id":"759534"}]},{"id":749015,"author":"Breath","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Made me feel at ease with their witty humour","body":"I received two minor operations today at Forth Valley Royal.

So trying again. It's also given me a little opportunity to add to it and reflect even more.  \r\nI am now 29 weeks pregnant, but I found out around 2-3 weeks. Being my first pregnancy, at the age of 33, you might expect I had a good idea from idea from others what pregnancy entailed but I did not. I didn't even quite know how to feel about it all. One of the first things I became nervous of was meeting my midwife for my first appointment. Would I like them? Would they listen to me? Would they be judgemental? Would I feel part of the process or would I feel that the process was being done 'to' me, as opposed to 'with' me? Will they explain things?  \r\nI needn't have worried.  \r\nI met with Samantha for my first appointment and was immediately put at ease. I had a number of worries and concerns, both medical and personal, and she listened with interest, compassion and empathy. Her supportive personality and manner immediately put me at ease, and I left feeling extremely grateful she would be with me through this journey. Unfortunately for me (but fortunately for all those who had chosen Wishaw for their birth) Samantha has moved on to the Best Start programme and while I wish her all the very best, I will miss her dearly.  \r\nI didn't realise what I needed from a midwife in those earlier stages, but it turns out that it is everything that is Sam: organised, caring, professional but personable, a good listener, good at explaining everything (ensuring proper informed consent all the way through), strong attention to detail, and attentive. Despite the pressures of the NHS, I was never made to feel like another 'client'/'case'. She spoke with confidence and passion about her work and about her care for the women in her case load, and while I struggled in the earlier stages, all of this was made better and easier each and every time I saw Sam. A good example of this is when it became clear I was suffering from hyperemisis gravidarum (HG). Having had a negative interaction with a GP who was incorrectly citing research regarding the risks of anti-sickness medication, Sam immediately sought me the help I would need. As I left my appointment, I was greeted by another GP at Kennilworth, Dr MacPherson, who immediately and without question prescribed me what I needed (and what continues to help me now). As a university lecturer, with a PhD and who conducts research, it was clear that Sam had also done her research and was up to date on the issues surrounding HG and this was very reassuring in terms of care. Furthermore, in discussions regarding breast feeding she was neither pushy nor judgemental, something I highlighted I would not have appreciated anyway. I often went in armed with lots of research and information, just in case, but with Sam, I never needed to refer to anything like that. She already knew it all.  \r\nFilled with trepidation now at meeting whoever will have taken on my case, I can only hope that Sam is reflective of the wider midwifery service in Cumbernauld.  \r\n*Update: While there appeared to be some issues with the transfer of Sam's caseload, and I appeared for an appointment in my maternity app that no one else seems to have noticed, Sam - even though she had technically left the service - still sorted this out for me. I am extremely grateful and appreciative. A complete credit to the profession!  \r\nI hope this can be passed to those at the Cumbernauld/North Lanarkshire service. In times of increasing job precarity, lack of resources and funding, staffing issues etc, I believe it is important to continue to highlight the wonderful service that some/many of our NHS workers provide despite the challenging environment.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-03-16T16:16:39.5833333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-03-16T16:19:48.07","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":8},{"name":"Scottish Government","count":1},{"name":"North Lanarkshire Health & Social Care Partnership","count":1},{"name":"NHS Lanarkshire","count":2},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":1},{"name":"North Lanarkshire Advocacy","count":1},{"name":"Partnership for Change","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/747607","id":"747607"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/747607/responses","id":"747607"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/747607/healthservices","id":"747607"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/747607/tags","id":"747607"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sl9-community-maternity-cumbernauld","id":"SL9-Community-Maternity-Cumbernauld","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nervous","id":"nervous"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/worried","id":"worried"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breast%20feeding","id":"breast feeding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/competent","id":"competent"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/continuity%20of%20care","id":"continuity of care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/important","id":"important"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/knowledgeable","id":"knowledgeable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/maternity","id":"maternity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pregnancy","id":"pregnancy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pregnant","id":"pregnant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professional","id":"professional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sickness","id":"sickness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassion","id":"compassion"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confidence","id":"confidence"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/empathetic","id":"empathetic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good%20listener","id":"good listener"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassuring","id":"reassuring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wonderful","id":"wonderful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20ease","id":"at ease"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/749184","id":"749184"}]}]
