I have read other reviews and it's always about the Reception and Pharmacy.  \r\nMay I add the Doctors are great.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-04-04T08:51:17.11","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2020-04-10T09:20:00.49","readBy":[],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/753670","id":"753670"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/753670/responses","id":"753670"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/753670/healthservices","id":"753670"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/753670/tags","id":"753670"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/h82615","id":"H82615","score":1},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disgusted","id":"disgusted"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/angina","id":"angina"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctors","id":"doctors"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/osteoporosis","id":"osteoporosis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pharmacy","id":"Pharmacy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attitude","id":"staff attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"}]},{"id":757907,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"\"Who are you, again?\"","body":"I am a long term user of this practice with ongoing medical issues so have to use the service frequently.\nThe reception staff have the weird ability to treat you as if they have never seen you before and have absolutely no idea who you are.\nCommunication is poor,  letters from from hospital consultants seem to be ignored and trying to resolve any issue always involves multiple phone calls.\nI understand it is a busy place and the intention of the staff is good they are under pressure and doing their best but I feel it could be more professionally managed.\n ","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-03-26T11:21:21","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-04-10T10:16:52","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/757907","id":"757907"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/757907/responses","id":"757907"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/757907/healthservices","id":"757907"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/757907/tags","id":"757907"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/m87016","id":"M87016","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ignored","id":"ignored"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good","id":"good"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/769324","id":"769324"}]},{"id":757912,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Beware ","body":"There are 2 very good male GPs but beware of the female.

Each time I was seen quickly and always felt like my concerns were taken seriously.  \r\nThe day before my due date in January, I had another episode of reduced movements so was admitted to be induced. The plan was to break my waters overnight but due to the acuity of the ward it wasn't possible. I was kept on the monitor overnight and all the midwives and obstetricians I saw were caring, compassionate and kept me well informed. My husband was allowed to stay overnight and was fed by the domestics (it was greatly appreciated). The following day my waters were broken and my midwife Julie and student nurse Kat were amazing. Once my waters were broken my labour progressed quicker than expected so I did not require the induction drip. Julie kept me calm and helped me to get through labour with only entonox. Kat spoke to my husband throughout and kept him calm.  \r\nMy daughter was safely delivered two hours after my waters were broken. We will be forever grateful to Julie, Kat and all the hospital and community midwives we met throughout my pregnancy.  \r\nMy husband was allowed to stay in hospital with us the night following my daughters birth, I strongly believe this helped me to succeed with breastfeeding. Having his support through the night when I was exhausted really helped me to stick with it. That night also allowed us to bond as a family unit and was such a precious time.  \r\nThank you for everything (and apologies for the delay in submitting our feedback).","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-04-09T16:10:57.0133333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-04-10T16:07:48.903","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Forth Valley","count":5},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/754386","id":"754386"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/754386/responses","id":"754386"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/754386/healthservices","id":"754386"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/754386/tags","id":"754386"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/forth-valley-royal-maternity","id":"forth-valley-royal-maternity","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/birth","id":"birth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/calming","id":"calming"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/induction","id":"induction"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/labour","id":"labour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/maternity","id":"maternity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/midwife","id":"midwife"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/midwives","id":"midwives"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/partner%20accommodation","id":"partner accommodation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/seen%20quickly","id":"seen quickly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/triage","id":"triage"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing","id":"amazing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassionate","id":"compassionate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/758306","id":"758306"}]},{"id":757850,"author":"Cowboy Hat","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"48 days on Cleves Ward","body":"48 days on that ward.  \r\nComplete Professionalism  \r\nExcellent Standards  \r\nNo Compromises  \r\nSuperb Matrons Larissa and Laura/ Lara and a nurse that pulled me through my trauma Ameta  \r\n","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-04-09T17:47:03.81","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2020-04-10T16:11:31.527","readBy":[],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/757850","id":"757850"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/757850/responses","id":"757850"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/757850/healthservices","id":"757850"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/757850/tags","id":"757850"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rwg02_110","id":"RWG02_110","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professionalism","id":"professionalism"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/standards","id":"standards"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fantastic","id":"fantastic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/more%20toilets","id":"more toilets"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20were%20fab","id":"staff were fab"}]},{"id":757855,"author":"Kazza10","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"My diverticulitis flare","body":"I have suffered from diverticulitis for about 10 years.

Anyway best laid plans and I was back 2 hours later and again treated immediately with my pain acted on as a priority.

However i felt i had a problem which needed to be looked at. As we are in lockdown i spoke to my doctor via telephone, she was working from home. We couldn't connect to a video chat due to a fault, so i sent her a picture of my problem via email. She was very understanding and i certainly didn't feel like i was wasting anyones time. Within an hour she'd made a referral to the hospital and i was sent a letter from them via email. Two days later i had a call from a consultant. \nThis is a completely different way of a doctor practicing to how we're all used to and I cannot fault how they're dealing with their patients during lockdown.

","body":"I was admitted to south bank to have my gall bladder removed. The process only took a few months to arrange & the hospital handled me much better than the Worcester royal. It was my first operation so I was incredibly anxious but the staff were very kind & very informative to every question I had. After my procedure I was admitted over night, where the nurses regularly did tests & offered drinks & food. My only problem was in the night time, I was in a lot of pain after my op & had to be hooked to an IV painkiller which in the night my blood had travelled up into the bag & id also lost control of my bladder during the night causing me to have an accident. I tried using my buzzer several times in the night as I was in a lot of pain, I was panicked about my IV & I needed to get to the toilet but was struggling massively. After a long while of pressing my buzzer, nothing was happening so after about 2 hours I had to wake a neighbouring patient to ask if she could buzz hers for me. A nurse immediately came in & helped me she was so so lovely & I couldn‚Äôt fault her but she said ‚Äúit‚Äôs been ripped out of the wall that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs not working‚Äù which led me t believe it was myself who pulled it out although I hadn‚Äôt moved enough to be able to pull it out. Several hours later another nurse doing my tests mentioned that she heard about my unpleasant experience to which she replied ‚Äúthat buzzer has been broken for ages I don‚Äôt know why they still haven‚Äôt replaced it‚Äù which made me think that it wasn‚Äôt my fault that I had no working buZzer as she had stated that the hospital had known about the buzzer & it hadn‚Äôt been sorted? Which then led to me having to suffer in the night in pain, dehydrated & covered in my own urine.

I appreciate these are difficult times but the initial three months before Covid and now I have absolutely no idea how I can access help.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-04-10T09:25:49.55","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2020-04-13T09:20:01.28","readBy":[],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/757904","id":"757904"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/757904/responses","id":"757904"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/757904/healthservices","id":"757904"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/757904/tags","id":"757904"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rbn02_101","id":"RBN02_101","score":2},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/access%20to%20services","id":"access to services"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/concerned","id":"concerned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/urology","id":"urology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wait%20for%20appointment","id":"wait for appointment"}]},{"id":758013,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Abbey Road Health care centre is great","body":"I had a phone consultation because it was a bank holiday and also because of the Coronavirus going on.

Soon after the Dr called me, when I explained my health issues he said he was going to call an ambulance. His effective care and communication is always excellent. I went to hospital for urgent tests, received a diagnosis and treatment and returned home later that evening.  If it wasn't for the lady on reception recognising I needed to speak to the Dr urgently and the Dr acting so quickly on the information provided to him, my outcome may not have been so good.  Despite the stress, volume if work, staff off poorly caused by the Coronavirus, I still received as always a first class service from this practice. The effective communication was the key to this and it all began when I shared my concerns with the first frontline member of the team who has an important role to play and that certainly happened in my case.

She came to find me & I was whisked up to the Cardiology Department. After a quick discussion of the risks attached to the procedure I was treated immediately A clot was removed and a stent inserted into the damaged artery. This prompt action undoubtedly saved me from lasting damage and probable disability , even death. Another problem was spotted during the procedure so I was scheduled to have a similar stent inserted in the other suspect artery before discharge. The initial procedure took approximately 3 hours from our first call to 111 to being nursed and monitored closely that evening. I now have 2 fully functioning stents, a supply of medication & a wealth of information about rehabilitation.\nI simply cannot thank all those involved, including the nursing , cleaning & kitchen staff for their professionalism which in every case was carried out with kindness , compassion and good humour.  Whilst I was there I witnessed the care given to my fellow patients and I can honestly say it was equally compassionate and of an exemplary standard.

I realise that as we have just started a lockdown period for the coronavirus that people are finding this a stressful time. However, rudeness doesn't cost anything and I yet again find myself complaining about the reception staff at Broom Lane. Their rudeness knows no bounds (one receptionist in particular). She spoke to me as though I was something unpleasant on her shoe! This is not an unusual occurrence and I keep complaining on this site about it but nothing ever seems to change. \n\nI am so annoyed that I am considering changing my GP practice to one where the receptionists are pleasant and know how to smile.  It's bad enough having to attend a GP surgery at the best of times.  But my experience today made me feel as though I had no right to be there.  Please, please can the reception staff be given some training on their front of house skills and undergo some scrutiny to ensure they are applying what they learn?
