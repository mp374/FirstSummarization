I had a very difficult pregnancy this time right from the start with many tests and a lot of uncertainty. The Tower team were always available to answer questions and if the couldn’t answer them one individual in particular took it upon themselves to find out for me. I never had to wait long for an answer.  Sadly my baby died at 20 weeks. The downside is the Tower team were not called on to be Bt here with me when or after I got the news . This is the only negative, I felt that the point of being under their care would mean I would see someone whom I’d be talking to consistently at such a horrible time. In addition to that the recommendation’ I was given not to have a surgical extraction I felt was mismanaged especially as I had PTSD from my last labour and history of mental health concerns.

The whole process reminded me of the queues at Disney and the experience was just as good.

I am not going to try again and, although my situation is not particularly urgent, how many more important cases are slipping through the net.\nPlease review the approach to appointment making and do something about it.

We believe the new system to talk to a GP or member of staff is better now than it has been in the past and maybe something to consider in the future.  We had our flu jabs yesterday and our safety again was undertaken with much care and consideration. Was well organised.  The staff are all friendly and helpful and nothing has been too much trouble.
