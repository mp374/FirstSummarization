It was all in all a great service despite the nhs being under a lot of stress. From the beginning, the dispatcher on the end of the phone was very patient and kind with me, and efficiently sent out an ambulance to come to my rescue. The ambulance turned up about half an hour after making the phone call so very efficient. The ambulance crew were so so lovely and compassionate and I could not stress enough how safe and protected and cared for I felt while in the back of the ambulance. They were extremely patient with me and they were very dedicated in their job making me feel comfortable and safe. Creds to these two ambulance crew members, you know who you are! I almost feel quite emotional at how kindly I was treated by them and they listened to me and weren’t afraid to have a conversation with me despite the circumstances. They were person centred which made my ambulance journey fairly pleasant. Brilliant service, I hope that all ambulance crews are as kind and dedicated as this crew that I was lucky enough to be under the care of. Keep doing what you’re doing.

I approached Thurrock IAPT for help and support when I was in a really vulnerable and scary situation. At the time I was homeless and living in a shelter and badly suffering. I found it difficult to talk to anyone or leave my room, my mind was a mess which left me hopeless and isolated. I simply could not see any future, I was backed into a tight corner struggling to breathe and it was exhausting.  \r\nI self referred to Thurrock and I found everyone who works in the organisation to be so friendly and caring, from the people who answer the phones to the therapists who do the initial assessment and in particular the one that helped me.  \r\nI did have to wait a few months for treatment, as I received EMDR specific for PTSD. During that period there was many times I felt extremely low and full of fear but every time I called the office, the staff were so supportive and empathetic which really helped me and eased my panic.  \r\nI was in treatment for seven months and had the most understanding and trustworthy therapist who knew I was fearful of the treatment and reliving the past. The therapist was always kind, thoughtful, professional and approachable - at all times I felt safe, heard and guided at a pace I could cope with. That safety and guidance helped me to revisit the horrors of my past, that I thought I had neatly stored away in a box, deep inside but had a habit of popping open, when I least expected it and completely disrupting my life. I realised that I had no control over those horrors, they were in fact controlling me. Whenever they did pop up as nightmares or flashbacks, I was often frozen in fear and honestly felt like someone was stabbing me in the stomach. Even during normal times when I thought they were locked away, they were always lurking in the background, so when I was feeling a little low or down, they would just make me feel so much more vulnerable, fearful and needy. Life had pushed me into a corner whereby I was more frightened of continuing to live with the horrors of the past than I was of opening up the closed box and now I am so glad that happened.  \r\nAt times the treatment was hard and painful but I can honestly say the best thing that I have ever done for myself. My fear of the EMDR treatment was so unnecessary as my therapist gave me some useful tools to deal with my thoughts and feelings in between our sessions. The reliving that I feared the most was actually recalling images and allowing my mind to freely flow from image to image. I do not know the science of how it works I just know that it helped me form new perspectives and beliefs, which finally removed the horror from my memories. The EMDR also helped me with my anxiety and has given me a powerful tool to use when things start to become unmanageable.  \r\nThe best thing of all is that it is absolutely free to anyone who lives in Thurrock and I know I can go back and ask for help if things become too much. I would urge anyone who is suffering to reach out and get some help - no-one has to suffer alone or in silence.  \r\nMy future looks so different from when I started last year - because I have hope. Thank you so much I am deeply grateful.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-06-02T22:04:04.4433333","progress":"Story has a

At 1:00pm bloods were taken, seen doc around 1:45pm went for X-rays. Got admitted to A&E ward and all I can say was like a war zone .  \r\nEvery bay taken up around 10 of us on chairs receiving drips etc . Very unsafe environment men pulling drips out of arms and leaving blood everywhere. One bathroom to share - I am immunosuppressant and meant to have a bay for treatment of my own never mind share a toilet. I sat on the same chair from 3:00 pm until I finally got a bay bed at 1:00am I was never offered tea or anything in this whole time I was in.  \r\nI finally got a bed on the ward - this wasn’t even a room, it was a bed in the corridor with a screen around it. The toilet was out of the ward which you had to wait for nurse to buzz you in and out. Again, a shared bathroom which I should not be allowed to use. I do not blame nurses as they are worked to hard, just not enough staff for the people coming in. I saw someone being pushed in on a chair, hood up. He took his socks off as these were soaked and was not checked once in all the time I was there. He was walking around, his obs were never done, it was like he wasn’t even there. I don’t know his illnesses etc. but basic human needs is to check on your patient even give him a blanket to keep warm and a hot drink - not left like he was on the street.

I spoke with NHS 111 who recommended that I come to A&E.  \r\nUpon arriving, everything was a shambles, we were told there was only 1 doctor for illness and non for injury, but they carried on streaming patients.  \r\nAfter checking in and waiting in the queue for an hour I was called back to the checkpoint by one of the nurses to do my observations, leaving the streaming queue. I was told to go back to the queue only then to have my observations done again. Therefore losing my spot and 3 patients who were after me got streamed first, which made no sense.  \r\nEventually I got streamed by a doctor and was told I would be examined by a doctor at The Partnership of East London Cooperatives (PELC).  \r\nFast forward 6 hours I am still waiting as I am writing this review. In the early hours of the morning, the receptionist told some patients that they were going home and so was the doctor therefore to go elsewhere. They caused a state of panic for everyone who had been waiting 5 hours or more. They shut the blinds down and the doctor came out shouting. The security guards came and the receptionist said they were being abused, which was utter nonsense.  \r\nWe told the security guards that there are 20 witnesses and not one person abused them, they merely asked what was going on as they had caused a state of panic by putting out a statement that the doctor and reception staff are going home. They proceeded cover up their mistakes and walked out leaving 50+ patients to fend for themselves. Nowhere to ask for help, no one to speak to and no one to tell us what is going on.  \r\nThe communication skills of this department is non existent and extremely disappointing. I feel PELC have ruined what once was a decent hospital. It's an absolute disaster here!  \r\nI feel the A&E area needs to be opened up again.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-05-23T02:03:04.8533333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-06-05T09:20:01.007","readBy":[{"name":"Barking, Havering and Redbridge University Hospitals NHS Trust","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1069528","id":"1069528"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1069528/responses","id":"1069528"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1069528/healthservices","id":"1069528"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1069528/tags","id":"1069528"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rf4qh_180","id":"RF4QH_180","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/y02523","id":"Y02523","score":1},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/angry","id":"angry"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confused","id":"confused"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scared","id":"scared"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/arthritis","id":"arthritis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/feet","id":"feet"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/knee%20pain","id":"knee pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lonely","id":"lonely"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mistakes","id":"mistakes"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/more%20doctors","id":"More doctors"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/numbness","id":"numbness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/panic","id":"panic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pins%20and%20needles","id":"pins and needles"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/security%20staff","id":"security staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/severe%20pain","id":"severe pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting%20times","id":"waiting times"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctor%20attitude","id":"doctor attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reception%20staff","id":"reception staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/receptionist%20attitude","id":"receptionist attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attitudes","id":"staff attitudes"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/night%20staff%20levels","id":"night staff levels"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/shambolic","id":"shambolic"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1080961","id":"1080961"}]},{"id":1072062,"author":"verily_r","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Partial hearing loss - reassurance","body":"The last few months or so I've had partial hearing loss with tinnitus, that kind of high-pitched ringing that can drive you a little mad. I'd dismissed it as ear wax, but it wasn't resolving. I use a CPAP machine and started to worry that the pressure might have caused damage or inflammation, as I've always been sensitive to that kind of thing and it does sometimes make my ears pop.  \r\nEventually, I rang my GP but couldn't get an appointment, however they did book me in for a syringing or the modern equivalent (I'm grateful they still offer the service). The problem, I was supposed to be using ear drops and they were doing nothing as far as I could tell, and I was getting increasingly worried that if it wasn't just a blockage, I might be further damaging my ear by using ear drops (I have a family history of hearing loss, I don't know if it's genetic though, hopefully not!). If I didn't use the ear drops though, they likely wouldn't go ahead with the syringing...  \r\nI tried anywhere I could think of to just get someone to look, pharmacy, specsavers, I rang again for a GP appointment but there weren't any available for almost a month (after the syringing). I'll admit I was getting worried. I finally rang 111, it took a day but they put me through to an out of hours GP, and I finally got an appointment at York hospital to see a GP that evening.  \r\nThe whole thing took maybe 5 minutes, a quick check and yep it's blocked, ear drops should be fine and hopefully the cleaning appointment will resolve the issue. It sounds silly really, to worry over ear wax, but my hearing is incredibly important to me (I'm one of those idiots who spends far too much money on fancy audio equipment). I just had this vision of a ruptured ear drum and drops seeping inside, ridiculous, but unnerving nonetheless!  \r\nI wanted to write this, as I'm sure GPs see trivial issues like this all the time, and perhaps don't necessarily understand why the patient is so worried. From the patients perspective though, it can be genuinely scary not quite knowing what's going on, and that reassurance is invaluable. I really would like to offer my thanks to the 111 team, and the service at York hospital that offered excellent care. Now, I'm just hoping the syringing gets rid of the blasted tinnitus!","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-05-29T09:21:52.2066667","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2023-06-05T09:20:01.35","readBy":[],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1072062","id":"1072062"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1072062/responses","id":"1072062"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1072062/healthservices","id":"1072062"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1072062/tags","id":"1072062"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/y04950","id":"Y04950","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/availability","id":"availability"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/concerned","id":"concerned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ears","id":"ears"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/excellent%20care","id":"excellent care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hearing","id":"hearing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nhs111","id":"NHS111"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/prompt%20service","id":"prompt service"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tinnitus","id":"tinnitus"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting%20times","id":"waiting times"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured","id":"reassured"}]},{"id":1072446,"author":"earmarktm44","authorRoleId":4,"authorRole":"a relative","title":"Poor home care service","body":"We paid for Caremark to do 2 x 30 minute visits for my mum who has dementia.

There is no recognition of the fact many people are unable to do this early in the morning. There must be a facility to use the triage system later in the day rather than it being turned off at an arbitrary time each morning - why not turn it on from say 0900-1200 and 1500-1800 each day giving everyone a fair chance to access their GP? 0600 to an unknown time in the morning is not reasonable.\n\nFurthermore, and probably more importantly, when you have an ongoing issue being investigated and require a series of follow-up appointments with a named GP, why are patients forced to go through the triage system anyway? In these cases, common sense should be applied and the receptionists should be empowered to make the follow-up appointment over the phone. Even better would be if whichever triage system was in use required a login with a username / password so patients could add additional info and requests for follow-ups to their case history at any time.\n\nThe old Patient Access system was the best when the practice used that as you could log in and select an appointment at a convenient time. Now, if you receive an appointment, no notice is taken of your availability, which is frustrating for those who work full time and have many time commitments.\n\nThe GPs at Speedwell are excellent but it's frustrating and upsetting that the practice has made it so hostile for some sections of the community and those requiring follow-up to access its services. Technology is great but it's not being used effectively here, almost just as an overlay to existing manual systems, which is the worst of both worlds.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2023-06-02T11:18:22","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2023-06-05T12:12:40","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1074201","id":"1074201"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1074201/responses","id":"1074201"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1074201/healthservices","id":"1074201"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1074201/tags","id":"1074201"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/e83010","id":"E83010","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frustrating","id":"frustrating"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/better","id":"better"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/get%20fit","id":"get fit"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/triage","id":"triage"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upsetting","id":"upsetting"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/empowered","id":"empowered"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20great","id":"not great"}]}]
