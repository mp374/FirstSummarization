The on duty chemist refused to prepare the eight weeks of medication and he would only dispense two weeks of medication. We immediately went to Elbury Moor Surgery and the Practice Nurse - Respiratory consulted with one of the GP’s. The GP concerned immediately issued a prescription for six weeks of medication. Absolutely brilliant service from both the Practice Nurse and GP. Their actions prove to me that the NHS is well and alive at Elbury Moor Surgery.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2023-06-30T12:11:04","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2023-07-01T13:42:10","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1085938","id":"1085938"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1085938/responses","id":"1085938"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1085938/healthservices","id":"1085938"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1085938/tags","id":"1085938"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/m81017","id":"M81017","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/concerned","id":"concerned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/respiratory","id":"respiratory"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20concerned","id":"very concerned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/alive%20again","id":"Alive again"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doing%20well","id":"doing well"}]},{"id":1083341,"author":"Chelsie","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Post operative wound care","body":"I had an operation 3 weeks ago for carpel tunnel release and attended my local treatment room which is situated inside the Waterside Health Centre in Londonderry.

As there no bed was available, until about 10:00 I sat in the reception area. During that time I was interviewed by the surgeon and the anaesthetist in what was described by one of the staff as broom cupboards. At around 10:00 I was taken to change for the op and then walked to the theatre. I came round in the recovery room at about 11:45 and there I remained for 3 hrs waiting for a ward bed. The nurse who was looking after me was very attentive and caring. \n\nI cannot say the same for the nurse in the rs sssu Bay 6 Bed 2. When I was in the ward I was just left. I had to call the nurse after about 30 minutes for my belongings to be brought to me having already discussed what had happened to them on my arrival in the ward. I saw the the two surgeons after the op who said I could go after I had   urinated. After I had been about an hour or so later and returned to the bed I called the nurse and told her I had urinated and that I had come over very hot while standing and a bit wobbly on my legs. She couldn't have been more disinterested and gave me the impression I was wasting her time. At no time through the whole stay did she come and check on me medically, although she did bring me a cup of tea and a sandwich.\n\nAt 17:00 when another patient was being served his evening meal I called over a student nurse who was making up a bed and and asked what the game plan for me was. The student was aware I supposed to be discharged but until I asked there had been no movement or discussion in that direction.\n\nWhen I was given my discharge papers I was also handed a pamphlet about the repair of Epigastric......Henia's  Form Pin180110-1439. I had a Inguinal Hernia and should have been give form Pin220311-1438. I found the correct form on line today at home.\n\nIn short it was a disappointing experience although I praise the Recovery Nurse and the Student Nurse for their attention.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2023-06-30T11:24:25","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-07-02T12:15:27","readBy":[{"name":"Royal Surrey County Hospital NHS Foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1085993","id":"1085993"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1085993/responses","id":"1085993"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1085993/healthservices","id":"1085993"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1085993/tags","id":"1085993"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/ra201","id":"RA201","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hernia","id":"hernia"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hernia%20repair","id":"hernia repair"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/inguinal","id":"inguinal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/legs","id":"legs"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1089252","id":"1089252"}]},{"id":1086004,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Great sessions","body":"My sessions with my therapist were extremely useful.

After his thorough examination he concluded that he needed further investigation and blood tests at the hospital. This he arranged and my husband was seen at the AEC unit at the Royal Stoke an hour later. All the staff we met today from reception, nurses and doctors were polite, courteous, friendly, knowledgeable, efficient and professional. Well done Furlong Medical Centre and AEC unit at the Royal Stoke and thank you for sorting my husband.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2023-06-30T17:11:54","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2023-07-02T16:00:41","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1086081","id":"1086081"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1086081/responses","id":"1086081"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1086081/healthservices","id":"1086081"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1086081/tags","id":"1086081"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/m83021","id":"M83021","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood","id":"blood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20tests","id":"blood tests"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/face","id":"face"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/leg","id":"leg"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tests","id":"tests"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doing%20well","id":"doing well"}]},{"id":1086080,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Excellent practice in all services ","body":"The practice has been incredible in supporting me post-surgery. \nFrom the efficient and timely processing of Klinik submissions and excellent service form the team processing these requests, to the GPs who have been caring and proactive in following up on any concerns and required referrals and results, and recently the nurses who have been treating a subsequent injury. \nAt what has been a sensitive time the service provided has been supportive and ensured that any concerns and issues were addressed quickly, appropriately, and compassionately.
