I don't know a way round this but as a person with a hearing loss I found hearing people with masks on very difficult and had to speak to my GP afterwards to find out what had actually been said about my condition. It would have been helpful if when I was moved to a \"green zone\" on the Covid ward, because I had tested negative for Covid, this was explained to me.  It took me about 24 hours to realise that all the patients in my bay had tested negative for Covid.  A simple explanation would have been reassuring.  I was very impressed with the family liaison service allowing patients to \"see\" family on an Ipad. Hospital catering seems unaware of NHS dietary advice including recommended amounts of sugar, fat and salt. I never achieved more than 2 of my 5 a day fruit and veg and some days it was only one.   The positives far outweighed the negatives.  Well done for the care you are giving in these difficult times.  If you need to go to hospital, even if you end up on a Covid ward, rest assured you will be treated well and safely.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-07-04T07:50:07","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-07-05T19:40:47","readBy":[{"name":"Mid Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/774903","id":"774903"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/774903/responses","id":"774903"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/774903/healthservices","id":"774903"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/774903/tags","id":"774903"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rxf05","id":"RXF05","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hearing","id":"hearing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/impressed","id":"impressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/well%20treated","id":"well treated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/like%20family","id":"like family"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/776225","id":"776225"}]},{"id":774907,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Simply the best","body":"I went in for a TKR on 26th June, feeling quite anxious as things are currently quite different.

To be honest, getting any appointment is a nighmare.  They've introduced a few different online services, but there are never any appointments available on there (if the site actually works at all).  Appointment times are NEVER kept to and are at least 30 mins late all the time, yet if a patient is every a few mins late, reception make you feel like a criminal and that they are doing you an incredible favour by letting you still have the appointment (and you will still sit there for half an hour or more!).  I've even had the very first appointment in the morning, and then seen the doctor I'm seeing wander in from the carpark with their bags and coat long after my appointment time, and then taking another 15-20 mins to get ready to see me.

Another Telephone Appointment was booked for a week after my origanal appointment, and I received an appointment letter confirming my new appointment date and time. Then to my great surprise, just as I was about to leave my house to go shopping, the telephone rang and it was my Neurology Consultant. They told me I was still on their list for my original cancelled appointment date, for a Telephone Appointment. What made it even more strange, was my original appointment was supposed to be in the morning and they rang me in the afternoon? As you can imagine, I was confused and hadn't prepared myself for this appointment with my Consultant. If they had rung me 5 minutes later, I would have left the house and wouldn't have been able to take their phone call.

A thank you is just not enough to say how much all of you are valued especially in these difficult times.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-07-05T11:48:52","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-07-05T21:29:16","readBy":[{"name":"Royal Surrey County Hospital NHS Foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/774932","id":"774932"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/774932/responses","id":"774932"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/774932/healthservices","id":"774932"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/774932/tags","id":"774932"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/ra201","id":"RA201","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ent","id":"ent"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helped","id":"helped"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/infection","id":"infection"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20valued","id":"Not valued"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/rushed","id":"rushed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/throat","id":"throat"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/under%20valued","id":"under valued"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/valued","id":"valued"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thanks","id":"thanks"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/776224","id":"776224"}]},{"id":774941,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"next of kin","body":"my mother was admitted through a&e for what I now know was sepsis although at no point was this confirmed.

Was fortunate enough to have the care of some efficient doctors and wonderful compassionate midwives throughout the whole labor period till birth .I could not thank them enough. However some bitter experience during the postnatal care period almost ruined my birth experience.  \r\nIt was in the postnatal maternity ward that the behavior of 2 senior staff members shocked me to the core. One of them constantly pressuring me to breastfeed and judging me when I had to formula feed due to lack of milk supply in the initial days after birth.  \r\nThe day after giving birth as i was headed for the first bath i simply asked them if i can get a towel since i cant find mine?In response they sarcastically asked whether I wanted toiletries as well, saying they had none of those either. Not to mention being highly irritated when i asked some basic questions about baby care or if I needed anything, ignoring my need for expressing bottle at times. The next staff member was equally rude, shouting at me for not breastfeeding properly and also complained to my husband behind my back that I was not breastfeeding my baby when other midwives were not around! Even threatening him that I would not be discharged till I was able to breastfeed properly! Such behaviors in the initial days of a first time new mother is enough to make her depressed and hinder the bonding process with a new baby. Even now when I have successfully breastfed and raising my beautiful baby, thinking of the postnatal period makes me sad.  \r\nHope this feedback helps the postnatal care for new mothers recovering from difficult surgery, being treated with more kindness and compassion. Please ensure proper postnatal care as it is an important phase of a mother’s life and it’s crucial new mothers start off life happy with a newborn.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-07-02T17:02:38.48","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-07-06T09:20:02.57","readBy":[{"name":"York and Scarborough Teaching Hospital NHS Foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/774676","id":"774676"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/774676/responses","id":"774676"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/774676/healthservices","id":"774676"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/774676/tags","id":"774676"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rcb55_501","id":"RCB55_501","score":3},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sad","id":"sad"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/shocked","id":"shocked"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/birth","id":"birth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breastfeeding%20support","id":"Breastfeeding Support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/c-section","id":"c-section"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctors","id":"doctors"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/efficient","id":"efficient"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/judgemental","id":"judgemental"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kindness","id":"kindness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/maternity","id":"maternity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/midwives","id":"midwives"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/postnatal","id":"postnatal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassion","id":"compassion"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/775003","id":"775003"}]},{"id":774714,"author":"Burns16577","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Stent in my ureter tube","body":"I had an operation 8 weeks ago to remove a stone which was stuck in the ureter tube, had a stent put in the tube to try flush out fragments that had gone back in, I got a patients copy letter when I left hospital and it says I was booked back in 3 weeks, its now been 8 weeks and still heard nothing.  \r\nI have phoned my gp for appointment as its getting sore, and cant get an appointment for 3 weeks, also phoned the monklands to speak to someone in ward 6, who have passed me about 3 times.  \r\nI have called to see about getting stent out, they all said they would email the consultant, but in last 3 weeks heard nothing.

My waters went 3 weeks early, and I had to be induced. The midwife who helped with delivery was amazing, and I felt fully supported even when things didn't go to plan and I needed intervention to get my baby out quickly.  \r\nSadly, my experience of the community team was anything but nice. I was initially placed with the central team who were lovely, but then it was realized that due to my address I should have been under the North team. I then struggled to ever get hold of a midwife, they NEVER answered the phones, rarely called me back despite leaving numerous messages. I had an appointment at 36 weeks, where I wanted to discuss my birth plan as I had some questions. The answers I received to questions about monitoring the baby etc was ask the midwife, I don't know, they do it the same as us with a Doppler (they don't, they use completely different machines and I ended up with a probe being attached to babies head in an emergency!). I was told it was too soon to discuss my birth plan and to discuss it when I was seen at 39 weeks. I never got to this point as my waters went 3 days later!  \r\nI was appalled by the North team community midwife, and feel I wasn't given any support and the appointments were purely a tickbox exercise for them rather than actually assessing me or my baby. I felt this midwife really didn't care at all, and I do not feel her knowledge of labour and birth were actually up to date.  \r\nTo end on a high, after my baby was born we were kept in over night. there was a HCA, she did bank and was a student nurse. Overnight I was exhausted with a baby who wouldn't stop screaming, she took my baby off me, cuddled her for an hour to let me sleep. She was my saviour after a tricky and long 4 days.  \r\nIf I ever have another baby, I am not sure I would use Croydon again, but this is simply because of the community midwife rather than the hospital staff as they were all knowledgeable, polite, personable and generally lovely!","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-07-03T10:02:32.4466667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-07-06T09:20:02.947","readBy":[{"name":"Croydon Health Services NHS Trust","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/774721","id":"774721"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/774721/responses","id":"774721"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/774721/healthservices","id":"774721"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/774721/tags","id":"774721"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rj6","id":"RJ6","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rj611_501","id":"RJ611_501","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20listened%20to","id":"not listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/birth","id":"birth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/community%20midwife","id":"community midwife"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/delivery","id":"delivery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency","id":"emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/healthcare%20assistant","id":"Healthcare Assistant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helped","id":"helped"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hospital%20staff","id":"Hospital staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/labour","id":"labour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/maternity","id":"maternity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/midwife","id":"midwife"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/student%20nurse","id":"student nurse"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happy","id":"happy"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/779055","id":"779055"}]},{"id":774722,"author":"Townsend","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Grandchild with coronavirus symptoms","body":"20 month baby sent home from nursery with temperature, mum phones nhs 111 and advices to contact gp, who says will not see child but to self isolate with others that live in house.  \r\nThe next day child developers a rash - mum phones nhs 111 again and said a doctor would call back.

In the current pandemic climate when asked to sign I've always declined and this has been accepted, until today.  \r\nGiven the pen attached to the desk is being used continually through-out the day and the piece of paper handed to you is used by all who sign, (worse still is when you're handed an old cardboard clip-bored with several pieces of paper attached) surely this is a possible source of cross contamination?  \r\nDespite previously supplying the medication when I'd requested not to sign for the reasons given above, General Pharmacy at Wishaw would not issue medication unless I signed their sheet today. I could have wiped the pen down but I don't think they would have been pleased if I'd sprayed the piece of paper with the anti-bacteria spay available.  \r\nWhy not go contactless, ask more question at point of uplift or even use a safe-word to verify the person collecting the drugs is authorised.  \r\nWe're being asked to socially distance, time to move with the times and modernise.","criticality":"minimally critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-07-03T12:11:38.1733333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-07-06T10:01:11.063","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lanarkshire","count":5},{"name":"Scottish Government","count":1},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":2},{"name":"Partnership for Change","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/774733","id":"774733"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/774733/responses","id":"774733"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/774733/healthservices","id":"774733"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/774733/tags","id":"774733"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sl9","id":"SL9","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/infection%20control","id":"infection control"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pharmacy","id":"Pharmacy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/contactless%20signing","id":"contactless signing"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/778331","id":"778331"}]},{"id":774867,"author":"valentino","authorRoleId":10,"authorRole":"a volunteer/advocate","title":"I am not a victim of addiction I am a survivor","body":"I started to drink at a very young age, I loved the buzz and confidence it gave me.

Indeed his skills were such that we were able to unearth aspects of our family history previously not considered relevant by ourselves.  \r\nHis manner was lovely, reassuring and very patient. He gave Dad a thorough and comprehensive explanation of his potential diagnosis, proposed further investigations and treatment plan.As a hearing aid user Dad was anxious about being able to hear so had asked myself to sit in on the consultation but Dr Sitaram's excellent communication skills meant I was not needed.  \r\nAt Dad's request we wanted to thank Dr Sitaram and Graham for their time and work arranging this appointment, it has been so reassuring and Dad feels much better knowing that driving may again may be in his future.  \r\nThank you again for your time, compassion and understanding. As a regional service the challenges facing neurology are significant and it speaks to the professionalism and dedication of the staff that at no point has Dad felt like a number or statistic.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-07-06T11:30:31.2966667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-07-06T11:47:43.577","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":5},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":2},{"name":"South Lanarkshire Health and Social Care Forum","count":1},{"name":"Scottish Government","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/774999","id":"774999"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/774999/responses","id":"774999"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/774999/healthservices","id":"774999"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/774999/tags","id":"774999"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sj9qe-400","id":"sj9qe-400","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appointment","id":"appointment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dedication","id":"dedication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctor","id":"doctor"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/person-centred","id":"person-centred"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professionalism","id":"professionalism"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/understanding","id":"understanding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassion","id":"compassion"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassuring","id":"reassuring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20manner","id":"staff manner"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thorough%20explanation","id":"thorough explanation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/remote%20consultation","id":"remote consultation"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/775530","id":"775530"}]},{"id":774908,"author":"sem2011","authorRoleId":3,"authorRole":"a parent/guardian","title":"Visiting A&E","body":"My son had a swollen and sore foot and after calling NHS 24, we were advised to attend A&E.

When I am tired I say to myself the mantra of my team which is simply 'I've got this'.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-07-04T14:16:47.24","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-07-06T13:43:57.69","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":6},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":2},{"name":"University of Glasgow - School of Medicine, Dentistry and Nursing","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/774865","id":"774865"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/774865/responses","id":"774865"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/774865/healthservices","id":"774865"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/774865/tags","id":"774865"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/g107h-physiotherapy","id":"g107h-physiotherapy","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bedside%20manner","id":"bedside manner"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20clot","id":"blood clot"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/coma","id":"coma"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/haematoma","id":"haematoma"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lungs","id":"lungs"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/more%20time","id":"more time"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/one%20to%20ones","id":"one to ones"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/physio","id":"physio"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/positive","id":"positive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/walk","id":"walk"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fantastic","id":"fantastic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/motivational","id":"motivational"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confident%20in%20their%20hands","id":"confident in their hands"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/motivated","id":"motivated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid-19","id":"covid-19"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/respitory","id":"respitory"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/775852","id":"775852"}]},{"id":775005,"author":"Purplegiraffe","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"More questions than answers","body":"I had my phone call review appointment with gynaecology last week.  \r\nI answered the call to be told they were unsure why I had been referred by my GP as the procedure I had done at the end of the year was related to my appendix nothing gynae, my review was also not with the consultant who had seen me in hospital, who’s name I was unaware of as I was discharged under the care of the surgical ward, but who’s name I would like to know.

This included child psychotherapy and some family intervention. We initially felt well supported by an excellent family therapist/case manager who sadly left the team. Since then our experience of this team has been poor and we now feel to a large extent abandoned.  \r\nAfter completion of psychotherapy with mixed results it was decided the best course of action was to complete a new series of assessments. This process started in Aug 2018 and involved a series of meetings for our daughter and ourselves with various clinicians over a long period of time. We also gathered input from our daughter’s school and observations were carried out. Completing these assessments was a significant undertaking, and at times pretty disorientating for our daughter. The process started 21 months ago, and while we were given the results of two assessments we await the outcome of two important assessments which were completed in December 2019. We find this completely unacceptable. We have since phoned the centre repeatedly to ask for information about the outcome of the two remaining assessments and what support might be available to us. We have spoken with a variety of receptionists who have listened patiently to our concerns and promised to pass them on to relevant clinicians who, they assured us, will get back to us. Sadly, despite these repeated efforts we have been ignored and have been left with no alternative than to try other approaches including sharing these experiences here and making a formal complaint (to which we have had no response). It is vital we know the outcome of these assessments as our daughter is at a crucial stage of her life journey. We understand this team are under huge pressure and that they are badly understaffed but it doesn’t seem too much to ask that someone have the courtesy to return our calls and to let us know what is happening – even if just to give some idea of timescales. We hope this posting helps raise awareness of the situation in some Scottish CAMHS services and might in small way lead to improved experiences for our young people and their families.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-06-26T09:33:06.3133333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-07-06T15:38:44.093","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":6},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":2},{"name":"Scottish Government","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/773971","id":"773971"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/773971/responses","id":"773971"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/773971/healthservices","id":"773971"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/773971/tags","id":"773971"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sj9","id":"SJ9","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/abandoned","id":"abandoned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ignored","id":"ignored"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/assessments","id":"assessments"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/camhs","id":"camhs"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/results","id":"results"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/returned%20call","id":"returned call"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wait%20time","id":"wait time"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/775024","id":"775024"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/775114","id":"775114"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/829864","id":"829864"}]},{"id":775025,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Not helpful ","body":"My mum has very bad mental health and after 2 years trying to get on there system for support, numerous GP referrals my mum final was able to recivee help which was a support worker to take her out once a week, because of the pandemic this was unable to happen so after 6 weeks of a few phone calls to mum they have discharged her, they feel they have done there part.

This is a condition that has the potential for improvement and reversibility with specialist input! In turn, this could allow people to get off benefits, work, have better quality of life. Yet, the 'outstanding' Walton centre does not offer a comprehensive service.  If some other hospitals can offer FND in and out patient therapy, then why can't this specialist hospital? I suspect part of the problem is funding but also support within the hospital  itself, for such a service. Sadly, FND patients are frequently misunderstood, discharged and left to get on with it.
