Unfortunately on Sunday night he was assaulted again head butted on his mouth!!  \r\nWe again were not informed of the incident by any one on duty at the time of the incident.  \r\nWe actually learned about the incident from a social worker on Wednesday who rang his mother to talk about a care package so he can be discharged.. unfortunately SS cannot as yet can not offer a package due to shortage of care workers ect ect ect ??? We are more than willing to help with the support package but he is ill and needs professional mental health and social care support too.  \r\nSurely his safety is of paramount priority!  \r\nSo how comes he’s suffered 3 assaults over a period of 12 weeks.  \r\nIt’s not acceptable that he has been in a safe place ??? and yet still been injured.  \r\nThese patients are vulnerable and need observing. They all have various problems and are or can be volatile! Surely that’s what the staff are paid to do!!!

I had always planned to have more than one child, but that's not an option any more.  \r\nIt's difficult to describe the issues because they are obviously so widespread. I felt that midwives had no interest in listening to my concerns, requests for support being repeatedly ignored or laughed at, left alone on a recovery ward for hours with no water, separated from my daughter and no one able to give me any information and getting angry because I was upset about it. The only thing anyone did have time for was to talk at me about contraception in a really aggressive manner despite me repeatedly saying no thanks.  \r\nA year later I still wake up in a sweat, petrified someone has taken away my daughter and won't tell me why. I didn't see her for 10 hours after she was born and kept getting told she would be brought to me any minute. The poor maternity care we received has had such a profound impact and I'm tortured by it all the more because I wasn't in a position to make a complaint within the timeframe. I feel responsible for other woman who suffer under this broken maternity care system.","criticality":"strongly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-09-21T08:09:23.28","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-10-01T09:06:53.763","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":11}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/879485","id":"879485"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/879485/responses","id":"879485"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/879485/healthservices","id":"879485"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/879485/tags","id":"879485"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sj9qe-501","id":"sj9qe-501","score":1},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/aggressive","id":"aggressive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ignored","id":"ignored"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/terrified","id":"terrified"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/antenatal","id":"antenatal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dehumanised","id":"dehumanised"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kept%20informed","id":"kept informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/maternity","id":"maternity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/midwives","id":"midwives"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mocked","id":"mocked"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/access%20to%20water","id":"access to water"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/listened%20to","id":"listened to"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/882470","id":"882470"}]},{"id":881656,"author":"guidebb55","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"I was admitted with Covid 19","body":"I was admitted to A&E.

Needless to say that this never happened.  \r\nAs I had not received any call back a week later, I rang the clinic again, this time I was lucky enough to get through to a very helpful member of staff on reception. They checked my Mum's information, noted that she needed to be seen and manged to fit Mum in for an appointment at the fracture clinic the very next day.  \r\nMy Mum has now been seen, she has had another x-ray and has been referred for physio-therapy, and is well on the way to recovery. All staff at the fracture clinic were brilliant, very caring and professional, A very big thank you to all, but especially to the receptionist who didn't just take a message to pass onto somebody else, but took immediate action.

I questioned if those who are seen by NHS so not out sourced would wait as long for results and told they are all busy but NHS patients tend to get results quicker.

If it had been explained by the consultant it was very busy and wait time was 6-8 weeks this would be so helpful and reduce anxiety.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-09-28T21:38:19.3766667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-10-01T11:09:44.63","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lothian","count":5},{"name":"MASScot- Melanoma Action and Support Scotland","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/881694","id":"881694"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/881694/responses","id":"881694"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/881694/healthservices","id":"881694"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/881694/tags","id":"881694"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/lauriston-building","id":"lauriston-building","score":2},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxious","id":"anxious"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dermatology","id":"dermatology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/information","id":"information"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mole","id":"mole"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mole%20removal","id":"mole removal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/no%20results","id":"no results"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/883368","id":"883368"}]},{"id":881971,"author":"pepsicola04","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Delays for prescription","body":"I was appointed to Dermatology in mid September. I have been waiting for my prescription to be sent from UHM since. (2+ weeks). I have called dermatology 3 times to chase up the prescription. I called back today and spoke with a very nice, kind secretary who advised me there is a back log in typing. They will kindly process my letter today, however this may not happen if tasked with other work. I find it appalling that there can be a delay like this for a prescription for medications to treat cancerous/pre cancerous lesions. To allow four weeks or more I feel is unacceptable. I appreciate the appalling stress ALL NHS staff are under given the circumstances, however patients cannot be left without their prescription for this length of time. Surely funding must be reviewed for extra support for the admin teams in addition to clinical? To think that departments were stood down in the initial phase of the pandemic and have had to play catch up with no additional support is fool hardy. More thought is required to ensure more efficient systems are in place. It is admin that is letting the NHS down.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-09-29T11:22:51.6166667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-10-01T11:30:05.057","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lanarkshire","count":3}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/881971","id":"881971"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/881971/responses","id":"881971"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/881971/healthservices","id":"881971"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/881971/tags","id":"881971"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l106h_330","id":"L106H_330","score":4},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appalled","id":"appalled"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/administration","id":"administration"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dermatology","id":"dermatology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/efficiency","id":"efficiency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kind","id":"kind"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/more%20funding","id":"More funding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/prescription%20delay","id":"prescription delay"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/secretary","id":"secretary"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/883609","id":"883609"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/883657","id":"883657"}]},{"id":882455,"author":"JMcC21","authorRoleId":3,"authorRole":"a parent/guardian","title":"My son's orthopedic surgery","body":"My son who is 14 fractured his wrist.

I am aware but not obsessed with my skin as I suffer from vitiligo. \nI completed the online consultation which worked brilliantly. I was able to share pictures of my lesion of concern. I was called to the practice to be seen face to face by a very nice female doctor who took high resolution photographs and who referred me under the two week cancer protocol. As I left her consultation she offered an alternative possible diagnosis which I found very  reassuring as I was extremely concerned.\nI had a call from Scarborough Hospital waiting list service and was seen at Malton Hospital by a Specialist from South Tees Hospital within 2 weeks. Their specialist assessment equipment enabled them to diagnose my lesion in the consultation as being a collection of blood cells and not a melanoma as I had feared. This was treated by the Consultant as evidence indicated it was effective. Interestingly every patient he and the Nurse Specialist had seen that day had presented with my particular diagnosis and not something more sinister \nThis was brilliant, compassionate and evidence based care in the height of a Pandemic. The online consultation I found to be really helpful as it gave me time to express myself and concerns and to attach photographs.\nThank you to the Doctor I saw and to the Receptionists who were very compassionate on the telephone and very efficient.

They looked at my heart as they thought I'd had a possible stroke. I was treated with statins due to irregularities.  \r\nSpeed forward to march, when I collapsed again to be taken to york and again they looked at my heart. Xrays and finally a ct scan was requested where upon further investigation it turned out I had a fractured t12 in my spine. I was told that I needed to follow up with my gp.  \r\nSpeed 4 ward again to may/june and still no help from gp I was rushed to york again due to no feelings in my left leg and toilet probs where again I had another ctscan to find l2/l3/l4/l5/l6 had collapsed and t12 fractured. The hospital and was told I have problems where my spine is like I am 85, and its a prob with the bones basically.  \r\nAfter a while, the nurse was very rude in the fact I wanted help was rushed in a ambulance, yet they threw me out the hospital without a way to get home and said it was not there responsibility so I was stranded and had to beg a stranger to pay for a cab to get home. I didnt ask to go hospital, I was ordered to go being unemployed I was given a walker and told I had to leave the hospital.  \r\nI was advised to talk to my gp about the problem, upon trying unsuccessfully to get a face 2 face with gp in july, I still needed help but was refused help. The gp said they were not responsible for getting in contact with physio, I would need to do that myself, which I thought eh not right. I also asked about what was happening regarding my diagnosis yet my doctor refused to diagnose the obvious problem.  \r\nI have been trying to apply to pip for over 1 year and due to no communications between hospital and gp I am in limbo. I find this absolutely crazy that there has been no diagnosis but told its a degenerative bone disorder at the hospital, so I am at a loss. I cannot walk too far and the speed its accelerating. I am now in even more pain as I feel my shoulders and neck are now showing signs of more damage due to trying 2 even do anything :(  \r\nPhysio were useless the gp was useless, and I feel ive been mistreated. ontop of the back problem, I suffer from bi-polar and the fact im in constant pain. My anxiety and depression is through the roof .. I am very worried I daren't not go out due to collapsing. I have troubles at home with basic chores, but im being ignored. no occupational therapy nothing so im left feeling suicidal and hopeless and scared :(  \r\nI have to goto york again on the 14/10 for a stress test and im panicking I cant cope and i feel totally lost my mental health advocate is doing all he can but even that isnt helping as the last year pip want the diagnosis they want the reports but there not willing to see me so im writing this here as a last attempt to try to get answers and the help i need ...  \r\nIm sorry but i really cannot take this much longer","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-09-28T13:14:35.0966667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-10-01T12:38:44.843","readBy":[{"name":"York and Scarborough Teaching Hospital NHS Foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/881585","id":"881585"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/881585/responses","id":"881585"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/881585/healthservices","id":"881585"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/881585/tags","id":"881585"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rcb55_110","id":"RCB55_110","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rcb55_180","id":"RCB55_180","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rcb55_320","id":"RCB55_320","score":2},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bi-polar","id":"Bi-Polar"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bone","id":"bone"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ct%20scan","id":"CT scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diagnose","id":"diagnose"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diagnosis","id":"diagnosis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/heart","id":"heart"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hospital%20discharge","id":"hospital discharge"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurse","id":"nurse"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/patient%20transport","id":"patient transport"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/physio","id":"physio"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/rude%20staff","id":"rude staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scan","id":"scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/spine","id":"spine"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/statins","id":"statins"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/walk","id":"walk"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/884735","id":"884735"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/885035","id":"885035"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/885755","id":"885755"}]},{"id":882530,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Open times","body":"Haven't been today but since when has the surgery been closed thursday afternoons, I'm sure iv been in contact with them on a thursday afternoon.

When I received my results from Katie she immediately put me at ease by saying it was good news and there were no signs of cancer before explaining what they did find on my CT scan, which thankfully was something very minor. My GP followed up with me this morning and we both agreed that this is an invaluable service.  \r\n  \r\nMaybe the only thing I could say that would make a small improvement would be when I was waiting in the waiting area for my scan, if someone was able to pop over and just say \"hello, nice to meet you.

We had further appointments every four months where we met with a number of doctors of varying rude tones, but who all failed to show us any compassion.  \r\nWe were referred for some treatment at another service within the trust only to be told we weren’t eligible (surely CFL should establish this). We were then wrongly advised by a locum doctor they felt we were eligible and it would be raised at the MDT meeting. We were never raised because the lead consultant disagreed - but we were not informed of this decision until we chased it.  \r\nWe called after having no contact and no scheduled appointments, to ask about testing that should be repeated following NHS guidelines. I called 4 times over 4 weeks. No one ever called me back until I managed to speak with a nurse who said ‘what exactly are your wanting from us’. Perhaps we are wanting basic care and patient dignity? That is too much to ask from CFL.  \r\nWe cancelled an appointment arranged after this call due to the tone of the nurse and general distressing attitude of the CFL. There has been no calls or follow up contact now for over a year.

The care could not have been better. All the staff I came into contact with were brilliant, from consultants through to the cleaning and catering staff. Everyone was friendly and efficient whilst at the same time they were professional and caring. The nurses/HCAs on Ward 10 were particularly amazing; nothing I asked them to do/fetch for me was too much trouble. Sometimes they even brought things before I had the chance to ask for them. They never once made me feel as I was being a nuisance, even though they were obviously very busy. The food was very good. There was a sufficient variety, including light snacks, vegetarian options etc. The portions were of a good size and the quality of the food was also good. Sometimes the food was not very hot but I understand the logistical difficulties of getting the food to so many patients whilst it is still piping hot. This is an observation however, not a criticism. The standard of cleanliness was excellent. Beds were changed regularly and there was an opportunity to take a shower whenever you wanted. I was only supposed to stay for one night so I did not bring the necessary changes of clothes, toiletries etc. but shower gel, shampoo, towels etc. were all provided. I am due to have another operation this month and I sincerely hope that I am put on Ward 10 again.

I was known to this gynaecology Department through outpatient appointments with the lovely Dr. Morales, who had been investigating my symptoms. Dr Morales had advised me that I was to attend the hospital if my symptoms worsened, which they did so I attended accident and emergency on Friday in the late afternoon.  \r\nI was seen by a nice registrar who examined me and referred me to gynaecologist Dr. Reilly who advised me that emergency hysterectomy surgery was required and that she would carry out the surgery that evening. I was so grateful that she was willing to treat my pain, there and then, despite any plans she may have had for her Friday evening....sorry and thanks Dr. Reilly.  \r\nI was then taken to a bedroom in ward 6 FVRI by a lovely student nurse called Sophie and prepped for surgery. I was very comforted to have my own bedroom with ensuite shower room as I experience high levels of anxiety related to privacy and comfort (a bit of a brat maybe but it really did impact my wellbeing both then and post surgery).  \r\nI can not remember the name of the lovely anaesthetist who visited me but do remember feeling very safe in his care and reassured by his manner and expertise. The two anaesthetic nurses who took me to surgery and looked after me were a highlight of this strange experience....they were so funny and kind. I apologise for any and all of my bizarre ramblings as I came out of the anaesthetic.....I remember being keen to hold my baby!!!  \r\nMy next memory is of Friday night or Saturday morning, being back in my room in ward 6 and being very gently and kindly cared for by the two night nurses (who I thought were actual angels in my post anaesthetic state). I was still wanting to hold my baby and they were SO gentle in their explanations about there being no baby!  \r\nI am now home recovering from my surgery and feeling much better than I did before surgery. I am a bit uncomfortable having undergone this surgery but NOTHING compared to the pre operative pain. Relief does not come close to describing how it feels to be recovering rather than living in pain.  \r\nThroughout this experience, I was treated with dignity and respect and felt that I was treated as a whole human rather than a collection of symptoms. I can not begin to thank the workers who operated on and cared for me during my hospital stay. The nurses in ward 6 were professional, knowledgeable and compassionate and a great comfort to me during my stay (especially wee Heidi who called herself an auxiliary but actually is a Superstar). The housekeeping staff were kind, efficient and entertaining....making my days much less dull.  \r\nOverall, this was as positive an experience as humanly possible and I would like to commend Dr. Reilly and the team most highly for their expertise, compassion and humanity. 😍","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-09-29T12:54:37.0133333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-10-01T12:58:50.18","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Forth Valley","count":7}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/882005","id":"882005"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/882005/responses","id":"882005"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/882005/healthservices","id":"882005"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/882005/tags","id":"882005"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/forth-valley-royal-ae","id":"forth-valley-royal-ae","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/forth-valley-royal-general-surgery","id":"forth-valley-royal-general-surgery","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/forth-valley-royal-gynae","id":"forth-valley-royal-gynae","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anaesthetist","id":"anaesthetist"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctors","id":"doctors"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good%20humour","id":"good humour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/housekeeping","id":"housekeeping"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hysterectomy","id":"hysterectomy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professionalism","id":"professionalism"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/respected","id":"respected"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/room","id":"room"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/student%20nurse","id":"student nurse"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassionate","id":"compassionate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dignity","id":"Dignity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thankful","id":"Thankful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/allowed%20dignity","id":"allowed dignity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/technical%20skill","id":"technical skill"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/883679","id":"883679"}]},{"id":881969,"author":"EllieP","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Covid vaccination centre","body":"I am a healthcare worker and recently received an invitation to make an appointment for my covid booster. I checked that 6 months had passed since my last vaccination and booked an appointment online (and it was a very positive, straightforward process). However, at the entrance I was met a nurse chatting to two security guards from the shopping centre where the vaccination centre was based. In front of the two security guards, they asked me which dose I was attending for. When I replied it was my third, they wouldn't let me in unless I told them the dates of my other two vaccines. I said I couldn't recall without looking it up, but I had an appointment. I was told this wasn't good enough as some people with appointments were attending within the wrong time frame and they insisted I told her when my last vaccine was before they would let me in. I said I'd have to look it up so instead showed them my appointment confirmation. They came across as rude and sarcastic and told me it didn't matter that I had an appointment, as it still might be within the wrong timeframe. I genuinely wasn't sure if they were going to let me in, despite having booked an appointment in advance. They eventually relented and said the team inside would need check. Once inside, I had no issues at all. The nurse administering the vaccine was able to bring up my notes and check that I had correctly booked an appointment, prior to administering me my vaccine.  \r\nAs a clinician who has worked in the health service for 11 years and also completed public health training and a dissertation on vaccine hesitancy, I am incredibly concerned by the difficulty I had even entering the vaccination centre. Surely we are wanting to encourage people to attend for their vaccine and then also return for follow up doses? The nurse actually reduced me to tears by the time I made it inside to check-in with the admin staff (who were absolutely wonderful). As someone attending, with an appointment, I don't understand why it was so difficult for me to get through the front entrance? Also, as someone who has also worked in administering the vaccine, I am fully aware that the actual vaccinator is the one responsible for checking dates so I don't understand why I was questioned about this before even in the door? Lastly, I am appalled to have been asked confidential questions in a shopping centre, in front of two strangers, as well as feeling accused of making my appointment inappropriately - it was quite humiliating. If it was necessary to ask me confidential questions prior to letting me inside, then this should have been done somewhere privately. To question me like this in front of two other people and reduce me to tears when I was simple attending a pre-booked appointment is not acceptable. I would never expect to hold a consultation with my patients in the waiting room or a corridor, and I would not expect to try and turn someone away who has a valid appointment.  \r\nAside from this, I do want to highlight that the rest of the experience was excellent. From the compassionate receptionist, to the staff nurse and HCA who checked my notes and administered my vaccinations (I got my flu vaccine too which was a pleasant surprise!). We chatted about gardening - if it is possible to feedback to them directly then please let them know that after the encounter I had on the way in, I appreciated their kindness and friendliness and their professionalism. The team manning the seating areas were equally as professional.  \r\nOverall, the experience could have been very positive. I do however worry that I am not the only one who encountered this difficulty on the door.
