My problem is getting worse. I know my body. I need an x-ray. Looks like I will have to worry the overrun A&E department at Kingston Hospital.  \r\nIs there no authority overseeing this surgery ? I feel the service just gets worse.  \r\nI am angry and frustrated.  \r\nWhy is their time more important than mine?","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-06-23T07:49:44.4933333","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2023-07-17T09:20:00.263","readBy":[],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1082223","id":"1082223"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1082223/responses","id":"1082223"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1082223/healthservices","id":"1082223"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1082223/tags","id":"1082223"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/h81078","id":"H81078","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/angry","id":"angry"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frustrated","id":"frustrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appointment%20availability","id":"Appointment availability"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/website","id":"website"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/service","id":"service"}]},{"id":1083139,"author":"danceps73","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Waiting for an ultrasound scan","body":"I attended Omagh hospital radiology department for an ultrasound scan, because I had a pain in my stomach going up into my rib cage that made me feel sick at times. My GP who referred me because I’ve started losing weight. I spoke to my GP about it and I got a letter for the ultrasound two days later, which I thought was a very efficient service, very speedy. I couldn’t believe it was as fast, the doctor is really doing her job. My GP is based at GP Drumragh family practice within the Omagh health primary care complex. So I’m pleased with the GP but I am disappointed with the system with seeing people at their appointment times.  \r\nMy appointment was 9:00am and you had to check in at the reception desk. I handed my letter and was told to go down and wait in the correct waiting area, which I did. There was a man right behind me and he handed his letter over and when I was waiting. He arrived and waited too, his appointment was 9:00 am and so was mine. He was called in at 9:00 am, and I was first at reception so I thought I should have been called in first.  \r\nThen another lady arrived with a bad knee and her appointment time was 9:15am. The fella came out and then the lady was called in, in front of me. Now, I am in my seventies with type 2 diabetes, I got to the loo quite frequently and I had to have 2 pints of water in the morning, as instructed on the letter for my ultrasound scan, so I excused myself to the nurse to say my appointment is at 9:00am. They said to hold on, saw the radiographer (or whatever their role is), then I was called in and the lady had to sit back down (with the bad knee).  \r\nI said I didn't think it was a good system, people after me being called before me; they said there’s 2 clinics going on, but I think it doesn’t matter if there’s 2 clinics or 22; if you get there first you should get taken in first. How would you feel if that happened in the supermarket queue, someone going before you after they arrived after you? No matter how much money you put into the healthcare system it’s only as good as the staff in it. If I hadn’t spoken up for myself I might still be sitting there waiting.  \r\nBecause I had said I wasn’t happy about the waiting system, the radiographer said there are forms you can fill in, which is of no use to me, I’ll tell you why, I’d spend ten minutes filling it in and then I believe the person that receives the form will crumple it up and throw it in the bin. So that’s why I am calling Care Opinion instead.  \r\nI don’t think that people should be called in before you if you arrived first.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-06-26T10:22:21.0133333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-07-17T09:20:00.7","readBy":[{"name":"Western Health and Social Care Trust","count":8}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1083139","id":"1083139"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1083139/responses","id":"1083139"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1083139/healthservices","id":"1083139"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1083139/tags","id":"1083139"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/nigp-pw0995","id":"nigp-pw0995","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/omagh-pcc-radiology","id":"omagh-pcc-radiology","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disappointed","id":"disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appointments","id":"appointments"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diabetes%20type%202","id":"diabetes type 2"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctor","id":"doctor"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/efficiency","id":"efficiency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/radiology","id":"radiology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/systems","id":"systems"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ultrasound","id":"ultrasound"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/speed%20of%20referral","id":"speed of referral"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting%20system","id":"waiting system"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1093342","id":"1093342"}]},{"id":1083216,"author":"cyclonewn55","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Left in pain","body":"I was on morphine for years I have chronic pain and I had to go to hospital for emergency and when I got out I had to deal with more pain complications.

I get up at 7:00am or so just to try make an appointment and it's closed. I get a questionnaire from the GP, but it's 15 questions long and I follow the link and it's not there. I feel the the receptionists are way above there station and not at all helpful when I want a gp appt .  \r\nI go on the app after 20 mins of constantly being engaged - it could be hrs on a Monday - and am told I have to go on the ask my gp app and request an appointment. I put phone down only to find the quota for day is full and not taking anymore requests for day. Feeling slightly miffed, as you would be, I ring back and after another 20 mins or hours to speak to the receptionist who also now appears annoyed at my annoyed tone. So,next morning, I try again and so it continues.  \r\nWe don't ring GP's for a \"How's your day\" chat, it's normally due to being unwell, in pain etc. When you do get through there are no appointments or advice to go to a&e which normally involves all day sitting there. This was the case twice due to osteoarthritis in my neck and trapped nerves, causing excruciating pain and 7 hrs in A&E waiting for pain medication.  \r\nI've spent 3 weeks in bed since Xmas,5 days or so at a time wishing I was dead in bed rather than sitting in A&E for hours, writhing around in agony where no position is even slightly comfortable. This is due to the GP insisting I cannot see a doctor due to there being no appts for the day.  \r\nI'm in my fifties and quite good on Internet but \"Ask my Gp\" is beyond me unless it's a simple repeat prescription. I'm almost scared to ring due to the here we go again attitude from the receptionists.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-06-27T08:56:47.83","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2023-07-17T09:20:01.56","readBy":[],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1083729","id":"1083729"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1083729/responses","id":"1083729"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1083729/healthservices","id":"1083729"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1083729/tags","id":"1083729"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/c83008","id":"C83008","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/annoyed","id":"annoyed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frustrated","id":"frustrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scared","id":"scared"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/a&e","id":"a&e"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/above%20and%20beyond","id":"above and beyond"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appointments","id":"appointments"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/booking%20system","id":"booking system"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gp%20surgery","id":"gp surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/neck","id":"neck"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/osteoarthritis","id":"osteoarthritis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/questionnaires","id":"questionnaires"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/receptionists","id":"receptionists"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting%20times","id":"waiting times"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20able%20to%20connect%20with%20distressed%20patients","id":"staff able to connect with distressed patients"}]},{"id":1085725,"author":"vegadn75","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Ilkley Moor Medical Practice","body":"Booking system never updated with appointments.

I acknowledge that I wasn’t the easiest patient to work with due to how extremely strong my DP (Detached Protector) was, which included being very difficult to get me to open up, and subconsciously self-sabotaging the work. So, it took a while know what my goals for therapy were.  \r\nThroughout the years the psychologist did mention that it may be necessary to pause therapy, which I initially interpreted as therapy ending and said as much the first or second time. The psychologist made it very clear that it would just be a pause and they would be happy to continue treating me.  \r\nMy main goal which was to tackle my feelings of defectiveness was retained, and when originally setting the goals, the psychologist suggested including reducing/removing the Detached Protector (DP), however the psychologist explained that in order to tackle my defectiveness it was necessary to remove the DP first which I accepted only on the understanding that my main goal was tackling feelings of defectiveness.  \r\nAs layers of the DP were removed, my feelings of defectiveness became more acute, my level of distress increased, which resulted in my psychologist recognising I needed hospital treatment of my physical health and to stay safe, which I myself didn’t recognise, so I appreciate their efforts in keeping safe. I'm not sure if improving distress tolerance was ever formally added as a therapy goal, but it did become part of the work, which I recognised as being necessary, and have no complaints about.  \r\nAs I did want my therapy to end (after completing the goals) rather than it being ongoing, I did regularly push to move onto tackling my defectiveness. The psychologist would say my detached side was still too strong, which I would accept until my feelings of defectiveness became more acute, in which case I would push to move onto tackling my defectiveness again, and again I would be told that I was still too detached.  \r\nThen, in I believe in late-2021/early-2022, my psychologist made it clear that if I didn’t make progress that we would need to pause therapy, which I wasn’t happy about, but I could fully understand as it had been a number of years, and would be a better use of resources to work with someone they could make progress with, rather than continue with me and no progress. The required progress being that the detached protector was further reduced, and my distress tolerance improved.  \r\nI achieved these goals in the Summer of 2022, and it was finally time to start tackling my defectiveness, week 1 of this I shared my third significant defect.  \r\nThroughout the work on removing the detached protector, I shared a few minor defects, and three what I consider to be significant defects (at least the defects that cause me the most pain), unfortunate the experience of sharing the last two (at different times) significant defects were not a great experience.  \r\nThe first significant defect shared was overall a good experience, and did some work (I think either the same session I brought it up or at the next session as well), which helped but didn’t fully tackle the defectiveness, which I wasn’t expecting it to and I believed that we would return to this after we had finished reducing my DP, which I was fine with.  \r\nThe second significant defect shared resulted in not been tackled at all, and was a bad experience when I brought it, and when I persisted at the following session it was also a bad experience, but I appreciate in the follow-up case that was due to me misinterpreting the psychologist’s motivations/actions, but did result in being tackled at all.  \r\nThird defect, the session I brought it up was a good experience, and psychologist did try to tackle it, but these weren’t landing, however I could see that they were trying, and I was optimistic that at the following session we would make progress and that the psychologist would be working with me as part of a team to tackle it.  \r\nHowever, following that session, the psychologist decided to pull the plug and pause therapy, one reason given was that the psychologist was unable to see my emotions, and so thought I was still too detached. Another reason given was as the result of me deciding to be more fully open and honest with the psychologist, and as it was given as a reason to pause therapy, I feel as if it was used against me and I was punished for being more open and honest. The psychologist also highlighted that because I had been in therapy for a number of years that a gradual exit process would be required, which made sense.  \r\nThe not being able to see my emotions was due to these sessions having been via the Near Me sessions, and I believe this was subsequently shown to be the case.  \r\nFollowing this, I was able to at least have a review meeting, where it was agreed that I would receive 6 sessions of using imagery to help tackle the defectiveness and then a further review, the success criteria for the review was not discussed. It feels like the intention was to always end after the 6 sessions, and that the 6 sessions were instead of my exit sessions. Throughout these 6 sessions and at the review sessions, the psychologist again made clear it would be a pausing of therapy.  \r\nI was only given one exit session, and at this exit session for the first time the prospect was raised that therapy may not resume. Leading me to question if I can trust anything the psychologist has said over the years.  \r\nI thought that I could reluctantly manage for another year of having reduced DP before resuming to tack my defectiveness, but I am finding it extremely challenging & difficult without support.  \r\n[Unsure about 'Treatment']  \r\n","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-07-08T07:45:16.4233333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-07-17T11:26:18.58","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Forth Valley","count":10}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1089144","id":"1089144"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1089144/responses","id":"1089144"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1089144/healthservices","id":"1089144"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1089144/tags","id":"1089144"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sv9-community-services-psychology","id":"sv9-community-services-psychology","score":4},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxious","id":"anxious"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bad%20experience","id":"bad experience"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/shocked","id":"shocked"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/coping%20strategies","id":"Coping strategies"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/distress","id":"distress"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fobbed%20off","id":"fobbed off"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/goals","id":"goals"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/honesty","id":"honesty"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/listening%20to%20patients","id":"listening to patients"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/physical%20health","id":"physical health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/psychologist","id":"psychologist"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/therapy","id":"therapy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/time%20taken","id":"Time taken"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unsettled","id":"unsettled"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/goal%20setting","id":"goal setting"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/struggling","id":"struggling"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good%20experience","id":"good experience"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/psychological%20therapies","id":"psychological therapies"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/challenging","id":"challenging"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/exit%20system","id":"exit system"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/difficult","id":"difficult"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/exploring%20feelings","id":"exploring feelings"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/broken%20trust","id":"broken trust"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1094343","id":"1094343"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1094532","id":"1094532"}]},{"id":1091949,"author":"hotelfw66","authorRoleId":3,"authorRole":"a parent/guardian","title":"Treated with such kindness, compassion and good humour","body":"I brought my daughter in who was unwell.

The interactions with our 3 year old put him at the centre of the care, lovely engagement keeping him involved in all steps of his assessment and casting. Explained everything to him first making him the priority and he felt involved from the start, made him the star of the show and put him at ease. Fiona the ANP, Alana who was the health care assistant and Nicola the charge nurse showed great person centred care, made us parents feel at ease by the care provided. Communication skills were second to none, talking and containing parents while engaging a 3yr old on a Friday night are sometimes skills we take for granted.
