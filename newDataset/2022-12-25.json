[{"id":1003240,"author":"Words64","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Not getting through on the phone","body":"I appreciate GP practices can be busy at times but I can never get through on the phone. It seems to be 90% of the time on an answering machine saying to call the next day or their message box is full.  \r\nI was sent a letter by the nurse of the practice to ring her for blood results and change of medication and it took me 2.5 weeks to get through and that was because I pushed the button for blood results. When I got through, they didn't have the results so asked them to put me through to the nurse. I had to make an appointment for 2 weeks later for the nurse to telephone me at a time during work hours however as it took so long I took the call.  \r\nMy mother is 88 years of age and has the same problem so asks me to call for her. My daughter has eczema and ran out of cream and as there is an option for repeat prescriptions, ordered a repeat as she could not get through to a receptionist to make an appointment with the doctor.  \r\nWhen she went to collect it from the pharmacy it wasn't there. The pharmacy had to go and ask them and she was told that she had to have a review with the GP and to ring the practice. She has not got through and that has been ringing the practice every day for 2 weeks, every half hour because her hands are so sore and needs the cream. She was in tears this evening and asked me to ring for her tomorrow. I know I won't get through but I will ring from 8.30 am and will continue to ring, but from experience if not engaged, it will go to the recorded message to call again the next day at 8.30 am.  \r\nThe problem is everyone then calls again at 8.30 am. Fortunately I work from home 3 days a week so can do this from home, but how can patients ring if they work or use the work phones or their mobiles whilst at work? We could go at lunchtime, however they close at lunch. I didn't realise this and was waiting to speak and approached the desk, when the receptionist blanked me when I spoke, and rudely lowered the shutters without a word or explanation knowing I had been waiting to speak to them and to pick up a prescription.  \r\nThis rudeness and bad attitude is not what patients need who are already stressed trying to rush out during lunch hour as they can't get them on the phone. Do these receptionists get trained on customer care, or how to communicate? All they had to say was sorry, we are closed now for lunch. Not push a button and saying nothing and then walk away. I now realise they close for lunch. There seem a good team of at least half a dozen back office staff so why can't staggered lunches be arranged or can staff not be rotated so that phones are covered between working hours?  \r\nI have high blood pressure and needed medication changed due to side effects of a new drug and it took me a total of 5 weeks to get to speak to the nurse, and this was not her fault, or even the receptionist's. There seems to be no proper systems in place to cover all the work and ensuring phones are answered. Are practice management and GPs aware that patients get an answering machine the majority of the time?  \r\nI dread having to make an appointment now and feel like they are doing me a favour to even speak to a nurse or doctor. I appreciate they are busy but I am not a patient that is constantly looking to speak to a Dr or nurse. I was written to and texted to ring the practice but the stress and time involved resulted in me not bothering.  \r\nI did get through to the nurse eventually as I say, after waiting 2 weeks after I finally got through to reception. I have expressed this with friends, family and colleagues and this is not an isolated occurrence. All patients of this practice have reported the same, not getting through on the phone, prescriptions being ordered but not left, elderly patients travelling by taxi to see the dr as couldn't get through on the phone and distressed.  \r\nI know funding etc is low and I appreciate the health service and certainly don't take advantage of it or complain, but when it is affecting being seen by health professionals when necessary, it could be dangerous. I already take my own and monitor my own bp and try to manage my cholesterol levels etc and only I asked about my sugar level (due to family type 2 diabetes), it was highlighted that it was pre-diabetic and high. No one had picked this up.  \r\nIt's concerning not only for myself but for all the other patients in this practice. I am concerned for my mother and other elderly patients who cannot get through on the phone when they need medication or advice. My daughter is currently suffering with her skin on her hands because she simply cannot get through on the phone and no point going into the practice because they say to ring at 8.30 am for appointments. Can the practice manager and GPs please be made aware of this and would welcome their comments. Thank you for offering this service and for listening.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-12-01T00:11:04.4533333","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2022-12-26T09:20:00.817","readBy":[{"name":"Ulster University, MBBS (Medicine) 2021","count":4},{"name":"Patient and Client Council","count":1},{"name":"Public Health Agency","count":1},{"name":"Ulster University, Faculty of Life and Health Sciences","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1003240","id":"1003240"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1003240/responses","id":"1003240"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1003240/healthservices","id":"1003240"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1003240/tags","id":"1003240"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/nigp-pw0071","id":"nigp-pw0071","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frustrated","id":"frustrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20listening","id":"not listening"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stressed","id":"stressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appointments","id":"appointments"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood","id":"blood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cream","id":"cream"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diabetes%20type%202","id":"diabetes type 2"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/drug","id":"drug"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/eczema","id":"eczema"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/elderly","id":"elderly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/high%20blood%20pressure","id":"high blood pressure"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medical%20team","id":"Medical Team"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/phone%20system","id":"phone system"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/skin","id":"skin"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attitude","id":"staff attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fantastic%20doctors%20and%20nurses","id":"fantastic doctors and nurses"}]},{"id":1006673,"author":"unhgf54","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Hampton Wick Surgery poor service","body":"From my experience this surgery fails its duty of care. They do not care about their patients. They never follow up the \"4 working days\" rule from their website when you contact them and they ignore complaints. Who is not tired of the nearly two minutes long message when you call them?  \r\nThe receptionists, who are not doctors, are too nosey when asking about symptoms etc to get a chance to be put on the call list. They are still not fully back to face-to-face appointments. A minimum of three weeks to get a blood test – as they changed their booking system – is a joke. They keep messing up with my prescriptions and do not follow consultant’s recommendations. They do not care that you suffer because you are out of medicine for a couple of days because they didn’t deal with your regular prescription.  \r\nOne partner had a told me off me once as I did not pick up the phone when the GP called me two hours late! I am not glued to my phone and may need the bathroom. I shouldn’t be blamed because the doctor didn't respect the appointment time. I needed a supply of my medicine for my holidays abroad. I spoke to two doctors a month before, I messaged the surgery several times explaining the deadline with the pharmacy and for one week I went to the surgery every single day, nothing was sorted. The receptionists kept telling me it would be done on the same day. It is very worrying that a surgery cannot get the right medicine or give you medicine on time as well as not calling back. My health is worse because of their lack of care and unprofessionalism.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-12-09T23:46:56.0366667","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2022-12-26T09:20:01.54","readBy":[],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1006673","id":"1006673"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1006673/responses","id":"1006673"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1006673/healthservices","id":"1006673"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1006673/tags","id":"1006673"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/nv1g5","id":"NV1G5","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lack%20of%20care","id":"Lack of care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20listened%20to","id":"not listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/call%20back","id":"call back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/desperate","id":"desperate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctors","id":"doctors"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/duty%20of%20care","id":"duty of care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/in%20pain","id":"in pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medicine","id":"medicine"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pharmacy","id":"Pharmacy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/physical%20health","id":"physical health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/prescriptions","id":"prescriptions"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/receptionists","id":"receptionists"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unprofessional","id":"unprofessional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/worthless","id":"worthless"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/caring%20doctor","id":"caring doctor"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/polite%20receptionist","id":"polite receptionist"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurse%20is%20friendly","id":"nurse is friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/answer%20phone%20quickly","id":"answer phone quickly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/less%20waiting%20time%20for%20appointments","id":"less waiting time for appointments"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/answer%20complaint","id":"answer complaint"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/prescribe%20right%20amount%20of%20medicine","id":"prescribe right amount of medicine"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/have%20prescriptions%20ready","id":"have prescriptions ready"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20stressed","id":"very stressed"}]},{"id":1009445,"author":"Needs Not Met Patient","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Distressed, angry and confused","body":"I recently had a particularly unpleasant experience at my GP Practice when I attended for my cervical screening test.  \r\nI have emailed my complaint to the Practice Manager of Sydenham Green Group Practice twice but have not received any responses to date.  \r\nI have been a patient at Sydenham Green Group Practice for years and have never had any issues or made any complaints until now. In recent months, I have experienced highly stressful and unpleasant encounters with some of the staff at the Sydenham Green Group Practice.  \r\nMy recent visit with the nurse was dreadful. I arrived on time and checked in. It turned out that while I was waiting, my nurse ate into my appointment time by stopping to have a lengthy casual chat with one of her colleagues.  \r\nHaving had a unfruitful and frustrating conversation with one of the receptionists, the nurse could see that I was not ok. I told them that I was unhappy and frustrated with the care and treatment I had been getting from the practice recently. They appeared to be sympathetic and then assumed a position as if they were going to commence my appointment. I was getting myself ready when the nurse turned to me and told me not to be rude to them.  \r\nI was taken aback by their remark because all I had done was let them know why I was frustrated since they had asked. The nurse accused me of being rude, having an attitude and taking it out on them. I most certainly did not and was not. I tried to tell them that but they just kept talking over me. Not being able to think, I drowned their words out with the silence in my head. Then the nurse said they would not see me if I continued to have an attitude. I was bewildered. So I picked up my bag and walked out. As I was walking away, the nurse called out after me stating that I could take 5 minutes to calm down and come back in if I wanted to. What a joke. Did they really expect me to let them perform a smear test on me after that deplorable barrage of accusations.  \r\nI have a hidden disability and because I am vulnerable at the best of times, I try my hardest to avoid stress at all costs. Distressed, angry and confused, I left the GP practice feeling far worse off than when I had arrived. My symptoms flared up for several days after and my medical needs were not met.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-12-19T08:15:14.0866667","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2022-12-26T09:20:01.823","readBy":[],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1009445","id":"1009445"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1009445/responses","id":"1009445"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1009445/healthservices","id":"1009445"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1009445/tags","id":"1009445"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/g85024","id":"G85024","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confused","id":"confused"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frustrating","id":"frustrating"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ignored","id":"ignored"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/uncaring","id":"uncaring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cervical%20screening","id":"Cervical Screening"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/complaint","id":"Complaint"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disability","id":"disability"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dismissive","id":"dismissive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fibromyalgia","id":"fibromyalgia"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/general%20practice","id":"general practice"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gp","id":"GP"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gp%20practice","id":"GP practice"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/listening%20skills","id":"Listening skills"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/no%20trust","id":"no trust"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurse","id":"nurse"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/poor%20treatment","id":"Poor treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/receptionist","id":"receptionist"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/retraining","id":"retraining"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/some%20staff","id":"some staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stressful","id":"stressful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unhappy","id":"unhappy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unprofessional","id":"unprofessional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20angry","id":"very angry"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/walking","id":"walking"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/talked%20over","id":"talked over"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/no%20response","id":"no response"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dreadful","id":"dreadful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/no%20reply","id":"no reply"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unpleasant","id":"unpleasant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/crying","id":"crying"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/accusations","id":"accusations"}]},{"id":1009468,"author":"aurigagm63","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Appointment system is very concerning","body":"Writing this hoping GP practice listens and changes.  \r\nWe understand about pressures in NHS as many in our family and extended family are NHS professionals. We don't call the GP /NHS 111/999 unless there is absolutely no other option. But we also have very vulnerable young and older family who have needed a GP appointment and to be seen and have been refused or declined. And as a direct result ended up admitted to hospital and the GP and NHS 111 have both ordered emergency ambulances . These are 2 examples and we could include more . This has now gone on for well over 2 years.  \r\nMy very young daughter has a serious condition and there is a treatment plan from the hospital with the GP as is NHS policy . This is because if not treated in time she will become very unwell with a very high temperature and breathing difficulties and it is there to stop this from happening. She has now been admitted 5 times after numerous attempts to get a planned GP face to face appointment where the GP could have physically examined and the treatment plan followed. This is extremely distressing for her.  \r\nMy dad has had a stroke plus he has serious lung disease and cannot communicate on the telephone to explain when he is unwell. He has been refused telephone appointments by reception and they cant tell us why and they don't keep track of how many are told no appointment, and if they did the practice would have a better idea of how the appointment system is failing .Then telephoned by GPs who didn't recognise the need for him to be seen. He lives alone and him even trying to call should have been a red flag. The GP practice insists on a system where every single patient has to be telephone assessed by a GP to decide if they need to be seen. It is extremely stressful to try and ever contact the practice over anything.It is an extension of what happened at the height of covid and we don't feel they have learnt anything about what happens when you don't see patients.Patients now know if they can't manage a telephone appointment - we have all learnt this from NHS lockdown and this should be respected and you can't assess someone safely unless there is clear 2 way communication. You can't even get any appointments planned, or emergency appointments most days, and when you double up in this way then it seems obvious that the capacity to operate safely is pushed to the maximum when it shouldn't be. The online consult system never worked when we tried it and now is at best open 2/24 hrs a day. This telephone triage system seems to be there for very simple illnesses only and everyone else with chronic conditions have to wait until it reaches health emergency status. This is our lived experience.Strep A outbreak and industrial action means they have decided now to refuse all planned appointments and tell everyone who cant get an emergency appointment to ring 999 or go to A&E as they can't offer duty GP appointments most days.

We have been in touch with the service manager for WestMARC and quotes are lifted directly from her response.  \r\n**The beginning**  \r\nOur local physiotherapist referred my grandson to WestMARC aged three in 2020, requesting a wheelchair and sharing information with his mother on the type of mobility aid she was considering.  \r\nAt this point, my grandson could sit unsupported, but could not crawl, stand or take any steps.  \r\nAt assessment, WestMARC informed my daughter that they considered the requested aid an “overprescription” and instead recommended a buggy. My daughter was persuaded that this was lighter and more convenient. This was the only mobility aid he had through two years at nursery. In contrast, nursery and home received excellent support from the local OT and physio AHP team, including access to well fitted adjustable supportive seating at home and at school, which was updated as he grew.  \r\n**The middle**  \r\nAt his final episode of physiotherapy in the community before starting school, from January to April 2022, his local physio again recommended contacting WestMARC for consideration of a wheelchair.  \r\nAt age 4 1/2 my grandson was still unable to crawl, stand or take steps.  \r\nThe implication of this was that school transport could not transition him safely into a taxi and a wheelchair would be required for bus transport. In addition after two years of daily use his lightweight buggy was falling to pieces. The local physiotherapist advised that WestMARC was likely to be more responsive to a family and suggested contacting them directly.  \r\nUnfortunately, my daughter did not do this immediately, being unaware of the waits currently, but did make contact as advised at the start of the school summer break. WestMARC said “we are reliant on information from referrals into our service to identify appropriate stakeholders in the patient’s care and where this information is provided it is documented to allow us to invite the stakeholders to appointments where possible“.  \r\nWestMARC also say their service is a “specialist area“. There is no doubt that their team does require highly technical knowledge and competencies to deal with the complex aids they supply, however, my grandson‘s local team are also skilled clinicians who know him well, and this discounts the most specialist person in his life – his mother.  \r\nIn my grandson‘s case, his original local physiotherapist was clearly not part of the assessment and prescription process in the first place, and my daughter was not asked about local AHP stakeholders when she re-contacted their service.  \r\nSchool transport as predicted has not been possible, although his local council have made it available. We cannot use it and for the past six months have been forced to transport him to and from his specialist school, which is 5 miles from their home.  \r\nIt is now my belief that my grandson‘s buggy may never have been an appropriate mobility aid for him and certainly quickly became inappropriate.  \r\nHad adequate liaison between WestMARC and the local AHP service happened at any point in the past two years the issues we have experienced could and should have been avoided  \r\nWestMARC said “the WestMARC team would welcome improved collaborative working. This is limited by clinical capacity. We agree that a team approach is always preferable to the smooth transition of patient’s clinical pathways and where these contacts are available to us, we will endeavour to work with them.”  \r\nThe corporate answer is clearly nothing like our families lived experience.  \r\n**The end in sight?**  \r\nMy grandson waited five months before he was offered an appointment in November 2022. WestMARC said “we recognise the importance of continuity of care, particularly for paediatric patients and their families, and this is why we have clinicians allocated to specific areas to facilitate development of positive relationships.“ So in 2 1/2 years, he has now been seen twice. With this gap between appointments “positive relationships“ are impossible to develop, even without changes in the staff.  \r\nAt this appointment my daughter was asked about self propelling and accessing brakes. My grandson‘s profile includes a severe cortical visual impairment and profound learning difficulties. These questions demonstrated a very superficial understanding of his profile. Since he had been previously assessed by WestMARC this profile could and should have been available to the clinician. Alternatively in the five months we waited for an appointment any contact with his local physiotherapist before he was reviewed would’ve prevented my daughter from having to retell the story of my grandson’s distressing and complex challenges.  \r\nAt this appointment, finally, a wheelchair was prescribed. Of course this is not really the end of the story.  \r\nWestMARC say “Pressures brought on by Brexit, Covid and supplies issues from overseas, also has an impact on medical device availability causing provisions delays to patients in some instances“. This definitely applies to my grandson.  \r\nAt his appointment, my daughter was advised that there would be a “6 to 8 week“ delay in provision of the device and of course, with the overlap with Christmas, the reality is a nine week delay. No early Christmas present for us.  \r\nWestMARC say “funding is provided via a regional consortium of representatives of the six health board areas we cover“ and have “an active caseload of over 60,000 patients in Scotland“.  \r\nI believe that WestMARC is too poorly resourced to be able to meet the needs of the population that it serves. As a regional service covering 6 health board areas, it is not proximal enough to the child at the centre, and the team around him, to be able to really “see” them.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-12-20T10:46:00.6366667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-12-26T09:20:02.94","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":8},{"name":"NHS Forth Valley","count":6},{"name":"St. Andrews University ScotGEM Medical Students","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1009898","id":"1009898"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1009898/responses","id":"1009898"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1009898/healthservices","id":"1009898"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1009898/tags","id":"1009898"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sj9-westmarc-fv-paedswc","id":"sj9-westmarc-fv-paedswc","score":1},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sv9-community-services-ld-fk","id":"SV9-community-services-ld-fk","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/angry","id":"angry"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/should%20listen","id":"Should listen"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20frustrated","id":"very frustrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/collaboration","id":"collaboration"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/desperate","id":"desperate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/funding","id":"funding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/learning%20difficulties","id":"learning difficulties"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mobility","id":"mobility"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/occupational%20therapist","id":"occupational therapist"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/paediatric","id":"paediatric"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/physiotherapy","id":"physiotherapy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/responsiveness","id":"responsiveness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wheelchair","id":"wheelchair"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1012033","id":"1012033"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1018207","id":"1018207"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1018393","id":"1018393"}]},{"id":1010461,"author":"Endeavor22","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Myself and my husband","body":"Not able to make appointment after 30 minutes of trying to get through.

We weren't told how long the waiting time would be. So far its Christmas morning, we have been here now for 8hrs and my husband has only been at triage. There are 3 other patients before my husband, apparently, as he is in the same category. Well what is the category?  \r\nWe do understand that there are ambulances coming in with real life threatening emergencies...but come on Wishaw general, maybe you could think of a better way to run your department. I have seen your poor receptionists get it in the neck from some people waiting. Not fair.  \r\nWhy can you not have a designated doctor who deals with these non life threatening categories?

I was placed on a gurney and taken into A&E 1 hour post trauma. I remained on the gurney in the A&E for what seemed seemed like an an eternity. Eventually after a failed theatre slot, I was on the table on my 81st birthday 2 days post trauma. I remained nil by mouth for 2 and a half days.\nThe food once one could get slotted into the system was delicious,& I am a very discerning eater, the staff were on the whole charming with one or two notably unpleasant exceptions. I was in and out in record time, 5 nights only.\nI’m by nature politely assertive, and have the advantage of being particularly medically savvy. I have also been a lifelong devotee of regular & strenuous exercise. I observed that many of my fellow inmates were not, & almost regardless of chronology did well or poorly depending upon their motivation & insight. \nDuring my stay there were strikes which did not help, the staff are there, as is the expertise, it just has to be adhered into a more efficient system.

I will be forever grateful to him for taking that time with me to reassure me.  \r\nI also had an amazing nurse Joyce who was an angel when I was back on the ward, even though I was still a little woozy after my pain relief and anaesthetic she reassured my mum and made sure I was comfortable for my journey back to Aberdeen.  \r\nA brilliant team!!","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-12-26T13:07:09.24","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-12-26T15:45:36.46","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Tayside","count":9},{"name":"ACVO TSI","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1011934","id":"1011934"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1011934/responses","id":"1011934"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1011934/healthservices","id":"1011934"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1011934/tags","id":"1011934"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/t312h-general-surgery-su","id":"t312h-general-surgery-su","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anaesthetic","id":"Anaesthetic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/knowledge","id":"knowledge"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/listened","id":"listened"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassurance","id":"reassurance"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/patience","id":"patience"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1018824","id":"1018824"}]},{"id":1011935,"author":"Cyclingourway","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Universally kind, sympathetic and professional","body":"I was admitted at short notice to the Day Surgery Unit for urgent shoulder surgery. The response time was superb. I was seen in the outpatient orthopaedic clinic on the Tuesday, and telephoned on Wednesday for admission at 8 am the next morning.  \r\nFrom the point of admission in the morning to my discharge around 9pm I experienced outstanding care from every member of the team. After being prepared by the nursing team, I was visited by the surgeon, Mr Moses and his assistant, Nicole. I had a problematic injury and Mr Moses went through all the issues very clearly and patiently. I felt really well informed.  \r\nThe anaesthesia team were also very kind and sympathetic. I could not remember when I had last had a general anaesthetic, and they talked me fully through the process giving great reassurance.  \r\nThe next thing I knew was that I was in the recovery area being looked after, once again, by a lovely team of nurses and other support staff. Given that it was quite late in day I was offered the chance to stay overnight, and was sorely tempted given the fantastic night team. But the magnet of my own bed , along with my wife, were too tempting and so I headed home around 9pm.  \r\nIt is common these days for people to complain about our NHS. In my own case I cannot thank the team enough. They were universally kind, sympathetic and professional.  \r\nThe next stage is recovery, which I suspect is going to be down to me in large part!

They will not give face to face appointments when you first call them. If you are lucky, they may see you afterwards.\n\nI developed painful boils on my face earlier this week. I called in and was only offered an evening telephone appointment with one of the permanent doctors on Tuesday 20 December. Of course, the doctor could not see my condition over the telephone and instantly diagnosed it as cold sores. The medicines prescribed (Aclovir tablets) have not been working (and this is even on the third day of taking them). My condition was deteriorating. Only when I saw the receptionists on the afternoon of Thursday 22 December were they kind enough to suggest I call at 8am on Friday 23 December and provided a face to face appointment with one of the locum doctors. The locum doctor was very nice. I need to provide a urine sample. In the meantime, the locum doctor said my condition is likely impetigo. This is very different to cold sores.\n\nThe reason for the reluctance to see patients is apparently Coronavirus, but nobody at this surgery wears masks and people come and go.

It’s virtually impossible to get an appointment to see a doctor; you can easily spend an hour or more on hold only to be cut off by the unhelpful reception staff or told there are no appointments left. The app they ask you to use is just as useless. I have two children under 2 years of age and have had awful experiences with both of them-my 1 year old was passed off as having Covid despite being limp, having a high temperature and vomiting. The doctor didn’t check his throat, ears, chest etc - just said it was covid and told me to give Calpol. 12 hours later we ended up in A&E where he was instantly\nchecked properly and we were told he had tonsillitis and a kidney infection. He was given hospital treatment for a week after. My newborn baby recently needed antibiotics and I was told the doctor had sent a prescription to the pharmacy. 24 hours later the prescription was still not there and after trying to get through to the surgery for 2 hours I eventually walked to the surgery to ask where my daughter’s prescription was. It transpired that the doctor had forgotten to write the prescription, but the receptionist was incredibly rude and kept suggesting it must have somehow been my mistake. \nI recently moved surgeries and can’t believe the difference - I can get a same day appointment easily, the hold time on the telephone is less than 5mins and the doctors are thorough, professional and reassuring. \nThe only thing I would say is that my experience with the nurses at Edith Cavell was only ever positive.

When I tell family and friends about the service this practice delivers they are often envious as so many people seem to have issues with other local practices.

Terence at triage was fantastic to say the least. When I explained about my son's autism and how the pain and environment was really triggering for him and asked if we could access the nurture/ multi sensory room, he was very understanding, spoke with the doctor and nurse in charge to arrange the best plan of care.  \r\nDoctor ‘Eamonn’ arranged X-rays, and then Terence escorted us to nurture room straight after which meant our son had a quiet space to sit and the sensory environment helped him manage his pain. Once we confirmed he had a fracture Christine came and put his plaster of Paris on in the nurture room where he was most comfortable and was very understanding of his needs and behaviours.

You still have to wait in a queuing system when you call but never as long and you don't get cut off. The receptionist are always so friendly and happy to help.

Every part of Penketh is so time consuming and stressful.  Most of the reception staff are rude, unhelpful and don't listen. Everytime I get prescriptions, which is a lot, something is usually wrong. I have taken paper work in, watched the person on reception photocopy it and add notes to the system. Next time I ring and after waiting for usually about 40 min to get through I am told the practice has no knowledge of what I'm talking about. I then get the paper work, drive to the practice which is 35 min drive from where I now live to hand it in again to be told when I get there that they already have the paper work. This has happened more than once. \nThe practice needs a complete shake up and a new experienced manager that can try and turn it all around.
