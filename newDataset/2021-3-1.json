However, I feel that the guidance regarding relatives being with a loved one at end of life should be reviewed and appropriately amended. Due to Covid-19 regulations, relatives are prohibited from being with their loved one at end stages of life. As a family we were given 10 minutes to be with dad, 3 days prior to his death.  \r\nI fully appreciate that we were fortunate to get this short time unlike other relatives that experienced loss in the earlier stages of this pandemic.  \r\n  \r\nPersonally I feel the terminal stage is when a patient needs their loved ones most. There appears to be no advocate to act on the behalf of the patient or relative to challenge such cruel regulations. Even staff struggle to come to terms with these guidelines. It seems, it is a matter of just accepting these rules. Yet there is evidence to suggest that there are inconsistencies in adhering to the guidelines across the board.  \r\nI am employed as a health professional by the HSC trust and am up to date with infection control policies. If I worked a shift I could have had access to my dad in his final days, hours and minutes of his life. Yet as relative this privilege was denied. AHP's are not advised to isolate after leaving the work place. Why should relatives, if they are willing to adhere to infection control policies be treated any differently?  \r\nShorty after my dads funeral I watched very powerful footage on Channel 4, which covered the care undertaken in CAH 2 North Respiratory. I acknowledge that it is important to make the public aware of the seriousness of Covid-19 virus and to also highlight the impact that it has on staff-whom I must add are doing a great job under extreme pressure. However, it was disheartening to think that, camera crew, reporters etc. are allowed lengthy access to a ward but relatives are not.  \r\nNothing will ever give us back this precious time that dad and his family lost out on, but I hope that I can maybe be a voice for any vulnerable patient or relative that may unfortunately face such a stressful, sad experience in the near future.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-02-24T15:58:40.2866667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-03-01T09:20:02.607","readBy":[{"name":"Southern Health and Social Care Trust","count":6},{"name":"Plymouth University, BSc Nursing (Adult) 2021","count":1},{"name":"Public Health Agency","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/827033","id":"827033"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/827033/responses","id":"827033"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/827033/healthservices","id":"827033"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/827033/tags","id":"827033"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_32024_340","id":"ZT003_32024_340","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disappointed","id":"disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sad","id":"sad"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/end%20of%20life","id":"end of life"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/end%20of%20life%20care","id":"end of life care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/regulations","id":"regulations"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/visiting","id":"visiting"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vulnerable","id":"vulnerable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pandemic","id":"pandemic"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/829603","id":"829603"}]},{"id":827097,"author":"Isabella22","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Doctor an hour late for scheduled appointment","body":"I had a mental health appointment by telephone ( due to Covid restrictions) I was first to be seen at 9am that morning but by 10am I had to phone the clinic as I was still waiting. . I believed that I had somehow missed a day, but the receptionist told me that the doctor was in the clinic and that I was still first to be seen.  \r\nAn hour and a quarter after the scheduled time for the appointment, the doctor called me. They said that they had been discussing a different case with a colleague. I asked whether they realised that the service was dealing with people who are mentally ill and need structure and reassurance. They said they did. I asked whether it had ever it had ever crossed their mind to get a staff member to telephone me to let me know there was delayed but that they were aware that I was to be seen. They said they hadn't. I said that common courtesy dictates that you keep people who are waiting for you up to date and that it was the height of unprofessionalism.  \r\nThe doctor said that they has decided that I was going to do a certain practical therapeutic treatment. I told the doctor that they had not involved me in the decision and had assumed that I lack capacity to decide for myself. In any case, the activity is not one that I would do anyway as I am not interested in it at all.  \r\nThe doctor then asked me when I was going to get a job. I explained that I had been medically retired from work on evidence that they had supplied my former employer. I added that while I receive an occupational pension, I still pay tax. I asked them how much more tax they would like me to pay. I told the doctor they were telling the wrong person to go and get a job and that I felt that they considered me a habitual welfare claimant, when in fact I do not claim a penny from the State.  \r\nI have submitted a formal complaint to my local MH Trust ref these matters and have informed them that if I receive no meaningful resolution and way forward I will contact my MP.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-02-24T20:57:19.3","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2021-03-01T09:20:02.793","readBy":[{"name":"Yorkshire & Humber Patient Safety Research Collaboration","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/827097","id":"827097"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/827097/responses","id":"827097"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/827097/healthservices","id":"827097"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/827097/tags","id":"827097"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rxt_710","id":"RXT_710","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/angry","id":"angry"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxious","id":"anxious"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/patronised","id":"patronised"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sad","id":"sad"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/patient%20involvement","id":"patient involvement"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professionalism","id":"professionalism"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassurance","id":"reassurance"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/structure","id":"structure"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/patient%20contact","id":"patient contact"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20capacity","id":"mental capacity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/paternalism","id":"paternalism"}]},{"id":827352,"author":"Autism Parent","authorRoleId":3,"authorRole":"a parent/guardian","title":"My son’s battle for Autism Diagnosis","body":"I am posting here as I am absolutely at my wits end due to the lack of support I have received for my son and don’t know where else to turn. I had a traumatic birth and my son was premature. His milestones were delayed and I first raised concerns that I suspected he is Autistic, when he was aged 1. I was told by my health visitor at the time that as a first time Mum, I didn’t know any better and he would catch up. I raised concerns again at his subsequent check ups and was told again that he was “probably fine”. I am a teacher and work with many ASN children so have a professional understanding as well as a personal ones. My concerns were dismissed.  \r\nI spoke with his council nursery who agreed and said they had wondered the same thing but had never raised it with me. I started with a new health visitor and so the process began again of me raising concerns which were initially dismissed by my new health visitor. I took my son to my GP as part of his sensory issues meant that he was refusing almost all foods and was losing weight and dropping down the centiles. Having met him once, she immediately agreed and referred him for an Autism assessment in 2019.  \r\nIn March 2020, when he was 4, he was seen by the specialist pre school nurse and she also agreed that he is almost certainly Autistic and placed him on the list for diagnosis. He was discharged from the health visitor when he turned 5 in May 2020. In July 2020 he had a phone consultation with a dietitian who requested bloods to be done. These bloods have never been done. He is still very small for his age and has a very limited diet. We had a telephone consultation with Occupational Health due to the motor skill difficulties he has. She sent us some cutlery and discharged us.  \r\nAfter a year on the Autism diagnosis waiting list, I’ve been told that I should have been referred to a different team when he started school in August 2020. This did not happen and he is currently in limbo, sitting on the wrong team, still waiting for diagnosis and help and support. He is struggling in school and I am struggling with the weight of fighting for him for five years and being no further forward. I understand services are very stretched and covid has not helped but we need help. I need him to be formally diagnosed so that I can begin to properly access the help he needs in school and beyond. I am so sad and stressed and angry. I feel we are continually forgotten about and that no one cares about the impact this is having on me and my son.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-02-25T11:51:48.3666667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-03-01T09:20:02.933","readBy":[{"name":"East Renfrewshire Health & Social Care Partnership","count":13},{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":5}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/827352","id":"827352"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/827352/responses","id":"827352"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/827352/healthservices","id":"827352"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/827352/tags","id":"827352"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/erhscp-fnp","id":"erhscp-fnp","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/angry","id":"angry"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sad","id":"sad"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stressed","id":"stressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/traumatic","id":"traumatic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/autism","id":"autism"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/autistic","id":"autistic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/birth","id":"birth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diagnosis","id":"diagnosis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diet","id":"diet"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dismissed","id":"dismissed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/forgotten","id":"forgotten"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/in%20limbo","id":"in limbo"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/practical%20advice","id":"practical advice"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/premature","id":"premature"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/referral","id":"referral"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sympathetic","id":"sympathetic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting%20time","id":"waiting time"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/weight","id":"weight"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/updates","id":"updates"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/access%20to%20specialist%20services","id":"access to specialist services"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/829561","id":"829561"}]},{"id":827353,"author":"izarse43","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Waiting room experience","body":"I had a member of staff discuss a personal procedure (flexible cystoscopy) in a waiting room with other people setting across from me.

I was triaged via telephone and the GP instructed me to attend my local A&E at GRI as soon as possible. Whilst I was preparing to leave for A&E my GP called back to instruct me he had already contacted Orthopaedics who would see me when I arrived. I was worried, but this reassured me, my doctor was trying to get ahead of the game so to speak. On arrival I was dispatched to minor injures but the On call orthopaedic reg was paged. Yeah, I waited a wee while but was examined by very pleasant, confident doctor (Kieran). He wanted to get to the bottom of my pain so pushed for a MRI scan to be done that day. By 1.30pm I had been scanned and sent to the orthopaedic ward. A couple of hours later Kieran delivered the results. I was to have surgery as an emergency admission, but would need to transfer to QEUH for neurosurgeons to operate on my spine. Both Kieran and the Trauma co ordinator on ward 61 @GRI continued to care for me whilst I waited for an ambulance to transfer me. I was informed it may take a few hours for an ambulance to become available, but minutes later, I was on my way to QEUH and the ambulance personnel were reassuring and chatty and, I felt, genuinely cared. Even though they were pretty frazzled nearing the end of a long shift.  \r\nI arrived safely at ward 64 @QEUH and again the care from nursing staff and clinicians from start to finish was just brilliant. I was in theatre by 10.30pm , returned to the ward by 3am, and with everyone’s hard work and excellent care I am recovering well, having avoided the significant life altering issues I would likely have faced without the surgery. There were so many people involved in this and I didn’t catch everyone’s names but my GP, Dr Soo THANK YOU! Kieran and the trauma co ordinator GRI ward 61 Amazing! Thank you guys too. And all of the staff @QEUH on Mr St George’s team and Su from anaesthetics, many thanks. All of the nurses, student nurses, support workers physios and domestic and catering staff on ward 64. Especially Rihanna, Hannah, Tracey and Carla thank you all so very much. Finding the time to comfort reassure and just be kind when all around you is busy, it just meant a lot to me, given I was in a spin with how quickly my situation had developed. Thank you all........it’s not enough......it’s just words.....but your words got me through and it means the world to me and my family.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-02-26T22:07:24.17","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-03-01T12:08:16.427","readBy":[{"name":"Scottish Ambulance Service","count":12},{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":10},{"name":"University of Glasgow - School of Medicine, Dentistry and Nursing","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/827997","id":"827997"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/827997/responses","id":"827997"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/827997/healthservices","id":"827997"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/827997/tags","id":"827997"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/g107h_110","id":"G107H_110","score":5},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/g107-imaging","id":"G107-imaging","score":4},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/scot-ambulance-pts","id":"scot-ambulance-pts","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sj9qe-400","id":"sj9qe-400","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20cared%20for","id":"not cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/worried","id":"worried"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/brilliant","id":"brilliant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20about","id":"Cared about"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency","id":"emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/end%20of%20life","id":"end of life"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mri","id":"mri"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mri%20scan","id":"MRI scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nursing%20care","id":"nursing care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scan","id":"scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sciatica","id":"sciatica"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/spine","id":"spine"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing","id":"amazing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20for","id":"cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confident","id":"confident"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassuring","id":"reassuring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thanks","id":"thanks"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20worried","id":"not worried"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pushed%20out","id":"pushed out"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/828391","id":"828391"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/828751","id":"828751"}]},{"id":827700,"author":"ariesyx67","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Discharge from CMHT","body":"I feel my discharge from CMHT has not been a positive experience which is very important to me having had many bad experiences of endings in the past which have impacted me greatly.

A frightening prospect, however the care I received in AMIA, was amazing. Staff nurses Amy and Emma, were kind, efficient and despite clearly being extremely busy always had a smile and a few words to all the patients they were looking after. Dr Close also had a lovely manner. Chris from cardiology came across to assess me. I was then moved to ward 109, where again, the care was great, Staff Nurse Dee and Staff Nurse Elaine (up from 104) were so good and in particular Staff Nurse Sam, who was professional, caring and went the extra mile to look after me. HCSW Marion is a gem and I would also like to mention a wonderful lady on the ward called Netta, who works a domestic, this lady is so hard working and yet always had a smile on her face and a few kind words, a true ambassador for the NHS. I had an angiogram (Dr Hogg), and again the staff involved, radiographer Chelsea and lovely nurses (sorry I’ve forgotten your names) provided absolutely first class care and attention. I was then moved to 216, all great team players with the memorable staff for me being Staff Nurse Emily who I witnessed having the patients of a saint whilst caring for a challenging patient throughout the night with a smile on her face and a lovely manner through out. Staff Nurse Joe and Staff Nurse Lynne are hard working, so knowledgeable and caring members of staff. I also managed to fit in an echocardiogram (Anne) and a mammogram Radiographer Angela and HCSW Mandy, thank you so much ladies, for your care, attention, professionalism and kindness. A final mention to the team that brings this all together, the wonderful porters, James, Martin, Christine, and Stuart (orderly from Radiology. ) You all work non stop and the hospital would grind to a halt without you guys. As you can see from the above, with 6 days of care, investigations and attention, there are so many people involved when you are admitted to hospital, (so many more I can’t remember your names, I’m so sorry, but equally important). I want to thank you all for what you have done for me during this admission and for all the other patients that are lucky enough to pass through your care. You can and do make a huge difference to people lives every single day, never forgot that!

I put it down to my B12 deficiency kicking in early. I normally get a booster B12 vaccination every 12 weeks. I eventually decided that I have a need to discuss this with my GP, as this fatigue problem was increasing & becoming more common as the months went by. After a number of visits to my doctor to discuss this problem I was referred for an ultrasound scan on my lower abdomen. The conclusion was that I had a large & fatty liver. Was this the cause of my fatigue & tiredness ? The doctors advice was that it was possible & until I receive further consultation & due to Covid 19 restrictions goodness knows when this will happen. And until I receive this consultation I or we cannot be sure. My doctor whom I may add has been most helpful & thorough dealing with my health problems also advised that I could be suffering from Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. My first thought was what on earth was this. To my doctor the comment was what prescription can you give to eliminate this problem. This is when my positive thoughts took a knock, when advised if my fatigue problem is the result of chronic fatigue syndrome there is no cure. All I can do is manage the problem. Easier said than done, particularly when approaching 73 years of age.  \r\nMy doctor then put a question to me do I wish to discuss this health problem with an Occupational Therapist. Again confusion reigned when this suggestion was put to me. Occupational Therapist, what is that. The doctor advised that my discussions with the therapist could assist me in managing the fatigue problem. This I agreed to, although I admit I was utterly & totally skeptical of this move. A thought I did relay to my therapist after a few weeks of discussions. Anyway my answer to the doctor was yes of course what have I got to lose by discussing this problem with the Occupational Health Therapist.  \r\nMy discussion or should I say my telephone conversation started on 21 January with Miss Corrie, who is located at Viewpark Health Centre. She after my discussions provided me with a a print out which gave an introduction to Chronic Fatigue problem. And more important in my opinion on the print out how to overcome & deal with this problem. One section in this print out was the heading Challenge Distorted All or Nothing or Catastrophic thinking. believe it or not when the fatigue was occurring my thoughts were starting run crazy. I could see no way out of this problem & it was a case of my thoughts my feelings going into overdrive & ever decreasing circles.  \r\nTo cut a long story short the advice received from Miss Corrie was very helpful. including the need to monitor my diet, which I may add was not dreadful but could be improved. Gentle & measured exercise rather than go like a bull at a gate.  \r\nTo conclude, my fatigue problem is still there & occurs whenever it feels like it. But with the advice Miss Corrie provided, I am more content with myself. I am not saying I have come across with a miracle cure. But managing the problem undoubtedly helps. And strongly recommended to anyone with this problem. Particularly anyone who may be sceptical of having discussions on health problems","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-02-26T11:39:51.8733333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-03-01T12:18:48.65","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lanarkshire","count":4},{"name":"Scottish Government","count":1},{"name":"Partnership for Change","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/827759","id":"827759"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/827759/responses","id":"827759"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/827759/healthservices","id":"827759"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/827759/tags","id":"827759"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sl9-gp","id":"sl9-gp","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sl9-occupational-therapy","id":"SL9-occupational-therapy","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/advice","id":"advice"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/b12%20deficiency","id":"B12 deficiency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diet","id":"diet"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctor","id":"doctor"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/exercise","id":"exercise"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fatigue","id":"fatigue"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helpful","id":"helpful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/important","id":"important"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/information","id":"information"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/liver","id":"liver"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/occupational%20therapist","id":"occupational therapist"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/positive","id":"positive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thorough","id":"thorough"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tiredness","id":"tiredness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ultrasound","id":"ultrasound"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/remote%20consultation","id":"remote consultation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/impact%20of%20covid-19","id":"impact of covid-19"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/828436","id":"828436"}]},{"id":827495,"author":"Dark Brown Eyes","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Receiving Oxford Astra Zeneca Covid Vaccine","body":"We were very happy with the service we received and the way the staff presented themselves on entry into the surgery and while waiting in the waiting area.

Otherwise, all went smoothly.","criticality":"minimally critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-02-27T11:51:43.51","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-03-01T12:24:50.547","readBy":[{"name":"South Eastern Health and Social Care Trust","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/828156","id":"828156"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/828156/responses","id":"828156"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/828156/healthservices","id":"828156"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/828156/tags","id":"828156"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt004-cvc","id":"ZT004-cvc","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/carpark","id":"carpark"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/distance","id":"distance"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wait%20times","id":"wait times"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/social%20distancing","id":"social distancing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%20vaccine","id":"covid vaccine"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/overall%20service","id":"overall service"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/829851","id":"829851"}]},{"id":828164,"author":"tangierene","authorRoleId":4,"authorRole":"a relative","title":"We need a line of communication with staff","body":"My mother in law has been in hospital for 4 months following surgical repair on her hip following a fall at home. My wife has begun proceedings towards obtaining guardianship as my mother in law no longer has the capacity to make decisions about her own welfare. She cannot go home but refuses to go to a nursing home.  \r\nMeanwhile, due to covid, my wife has not seen her mother since the first week of November. Only one nurse in all that time has taken the time to answer my wife's questions about her mother. The rest simply say 'oh she's fine' and offer very little else.  \r\nMy mother in law is still grieving for her husband of 63 years who passed away 18 months ago. She's been institutionalized for 4 months now. The psychiatrist who evaluated her told my wife, after they only had that one interview, that she did not seem depressed. When my wife said that her mother might not have been entirely truthful with them, the psychiatrist was quite offended implying that, in their experience, patients never lied to them. When my wife then said that her mother had said several times that she just wanted to die, the response was that a person didn't need to be depressed to want to commit suicide.  \r\nLast night my mother in law asked my wife to bring something in that she could use to end her life. This morning when my wife took clean laundry to the hospital for her mother, she informed the staff person who was sent down to retrieve it about her mother's request. This staff member brushed off my wife's concerns, saying 'it will be in the notes', and walked away. My wife came home extremely upset.  \r\nIt feels like the staff don't care about the patients, that the unit my mother in law is on is simply a storage unit until she able to be discharged. Are staff only concerned with my mother in law's physical needs? Are her emotional needs not just as important? What is my wife to tell her aunts when they tell her that my mother in law has also made similar requests of them?  \r\nMany of these questions could have been addressed if my wife was able to visit. But she can't. My wife is the only family member who is allowed to call the hospital. It is extremely frustrating and dissatisfying to feel not listened to, ignored, and not have your concerns validated.  \r\nI know staffing is always an issue, now more than ever, but I feel that they need to designate one staff person to liaise with family, to regularly update them on the patient's condition and progress, and to ensure issues like this are reported to the doctor or other appropriate staff and then get back to the family with a result.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-02-27T12:26:02.48","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-03-01T12:28:08.343","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Fife","count":17},{"name":"Fife Health & Social Care Partnership","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/828164","id":"828164"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/828164/responses","id":"828164"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/828164/healthservices","id":"828164"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/828164/tags","id":"828164"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/f805h_110","id":"F805H_110","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frustrating","id":"frustrating"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ignored","id":"ignored"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20listened%20to","id":"not listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/concerned","id":"concerned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/depressed","id":"depressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dismissive","id":"dismissive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/end%20of%20life","id":"end of life"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fall","id":"fall"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hip","id":"hip"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kept%20informed","id":"kept informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attitude","id":"staff attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%20restrictions","id":"covid restrictions"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/828434","id":"828434"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/828441","id":"828441"}]},{"id":828159,"author":"Lynda1955!","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"COVID injection","body":"I got there in time seen straight away .. it was all over in a few minutes and I never felt a thing ...

When I first considered being referred to a GIC the waiting list was a little over 3 years, that was only a few months ago. Now, the waiting list is 3 years and 8 months, in a few months I would not be surprised if the waiting list was 4 years.  \r\nThis needs to change. More and more people are on these waiting lists, but the facilities, staff and resources are not being increased to meet this demand. It is my opinion that people can die on these waiting lists, not being given the treatment they need.  \r\nThere needs to be systematic change. It's clear that waiting so long for certain things is unnecessary. Initial assessment appointments can be done much sooner, administered through a GP. GPs can also monitor and prescribe hormone treatments much sooner. Gender confirmation surgeries would require specialist attention and treatment, so it's understandable for that wait. I feel that this system is inherently flawed and is designed poorly, where a lot of these things could be done outside of this almost 4 year long waiting list.  \r\nConsider systematic change for these gender identity clinics, for the life and wellbeing of trans people in the UK.

She has been shielding throughout the pandemic and is on the shielding list. She received an appointment for vaccination in early February. As she was unable to attend the vaccination clinic this was switched to a home appointment on the same day as the original appointment. However, no one showed up on the agreed day and no explanation was offered. She got in contact the next day and was initially informed that she was marked as having already had the vaccine, which she had not. She was then told that the home visiting teams were very busy and they would get to her as soon as they could. After waiting more than a week I contacted NHS Lanarkshire and her local MSP directly and was asked to supply contact details for her, which I provided. Both myself and her MSP were assured that the vaccination team was aware of her and would be in touch shortly. When she still hadn't heard a few days later I got back in touch with NHS Lanarkshire and her MSP, and, again, myself and her MSP were offered assurances that the team would be in touch. At the end of February two (lovely) ladies from the vaccination team arrived on her doorstep at 8.30am unannounced to give her the vaccination. While she is relieved to have finally received it, we are all alarmed that she was told by the ladies who arrived to vaccinate her that they hadn't been able to contact her directly to arrange the appointment as they did not have any contact information for her. This is despite her providing it directly, and myself and her MSP both also providing it to NHS Lanarkshire. I absolutely appreciate how busy a time this is for everyone working in the health service and am hugely grateful for their amazing efforts. However, I am writing this to express my concerns about NHS Lanarkshire's data management issues in this case - first, in her being incorrectly marked as vaccinated, and then her phone number not being provided to the vaccination team despite repeated assurances that it had been - which could have had severe consequences for my vulnerable relative.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-02-28T11:30:28.7533333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-03-01T16:43:34.763","readBy":[{"name":"Fife Health & Social Care Partnership","count":1},{"name":"NHS Lanarkshire","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/828293","id":"828293"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/828293/responses","id":"828293"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/828293/healthservices","id":"828293"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/828293/tags","id":"828293"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sl9","id":"SL9","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/copd","id":"copd"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/elderly","id":"elderly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/housebound","id":"housebound"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/information%20sharing","id":"information sharing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/oxygen","id":"oxygen"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vaccination","id":"vaccination"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vulnerable","id":"vulnerable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pandemic","id":"pandemic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%20vaccine","id":"covid vaccine"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/829449","id":"829449"}]},{"id":828342,"author":"Docbabs","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Outstanding care for my endoscopy and blood transfusion","body":"I had been to my GP with no energy, struggling to eat and in immense pain.

We were both masked, vaccinated and had no temperatures. Learned later that other couples were together but my mother had to walk in alone. I learned later she was embarrassed, as she had to shout and everyone could hear. She had previously told the nurse at the door that \"my daughter is my ears\" and I had also indicated the communication difficulties but she still had to go in alone. I had to walk away sick with worry on how she could communicate and whether she would pass out, as she was so frail. She had been bed bound for a full week prior to arrival at A& E. The nurse at the door offered no assistance to get her to reception or even assist her there. This was horrendous for both of us. I learned later it was at least 4 hours before she was given a drink and something to eat.  \r\n___________  \r\nI cannot understand why on my mother's admission to Neely Ward that the Nurse merely showed her the bed. She did not point out her locker; my mother had to ask another patient which locker she should use. The Nurse did not offer assistance in unpacking and nor was Mum shown the bell to ring for assistance, the TV/radio and how to operate these, or if required, provided with earphones. Nor did the Nurse explain about the Ward's portable telephone (not everyone has a mobile). Surely, this should be standard practice on admission? My mother only learned of their existence several days later and the Nurse had no idea if earphones were available. Disappointed to learn that my mother had indicated on several occasions that the handwash in the bathroom was empty and needed replaced. Also disgusted to learn that when my mother went to the bathroom she found a filled specimen tray in the toilet. She had to call a Nurse who removed it by merely placing it on the bathroom floor and left! On discharge the handwash was still empty!  \r\n__________________  \r\nAlthough the nursing and medical staff within Neely Ward took excellent care of my mother and I appreciate everything they did to get her on the road to recovery, an issue raised would be as follows.:-  \r\nThe nursing staff are in soft shoes but this proved ironic as on a regular basis throughout the day and night they were disposing of rubbish or gloves into a bin that had no rubber seal on the rim. Therefore, the bin would bang and the patients would jump. This went on throughout the night which meant the patients were not getting a restful sleep due to this clanging bin. Surely, someone can fit a rubber seal to a bin/bins and avoid unnecessary noise?","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-02-27T15:01:26.7133333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-03-01T16:51:22.557","readBy":[{"name":"South Eastern Health and Social Care Trust","count":6},{"name":"Yorkshire & Humber Patient Safety Research Collaboration","count":1},{"name":"Public Health Agency","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/828196","id":"828196"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/828196/responses","id":"828196"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/828196/healthservices","id":"828196"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/828196/tags","id":"828196"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt004_07021_180","id":"ZT004_07021_180","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt004_07021-nw","id":"zt004_07021-nw","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disappointed","id":"disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/embarrassed","id":"embarrassed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/alone","id":"alone"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication%20difficulties","id":"communication difficulties"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ears","id":"ears"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frail","id":"frail"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/noise%20levels","id":"Noise Levels"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/toilet","id":"toilet"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/walk","id":"walk"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20disappointed","id":"very disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ward%20phone","id":"ward phone"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/828463","id":"828463"}]},{"id":828202,"author":"eridanusrd84","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Hats off to all the staff working tirelessly here","body":"Just had my covid vaccination at the Royal Victoria Hospital Belfast, amazing! such a slick operation in place.
