Examples include, only online meetings where the clinician's understanding of English was so poor that her reports have numerous factual inaccuracies. Multiple conflicting diagnoses that have been given from different clinicians ranging from a personality disorder to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder to anxiety and depression. Having to wait months for therapy despite daughter self harming and presenting at A&E with suicidal ideation. Medicine being promised then prescriptions not being sent. Repeatedly having to chase prescriptions. Meetings with clinicians where notes have clearly not been read and previous diagnoses disputed.

No childbirth and nearly 5 years past menopause. After TVUS, the original consultant, said a biopsy was needed. No further information offered from consultant on procedure or offering to stop if the biopsy was too painful. Traumatic does not describe the event. Unbeknown to me they proceeded to dilate my cervix which resulted in me literally screaming, not a yell, but scream, 3 times, but they carried on, before the Pipelle was used for the biopsy. The biopsy itself was just bearable by using a breathing technique. Couldn't wait to get out of there!!  \r\nUltimately with no further information, received an appointment to see another consultant. I arrived at said appt and I asked why I was there. The consultant looked at my notes, paused and then said for a Hysteroscopy for a possible polyp. They then asked had I not received any notification from previous appt and I replied I had not. No way was I having this procedure carried out without a GA. I left the appt. and 2 days later received a letter from original consultant saying everything was reassuringly normal and didn't need to be seen again.  \r\nMove on to present day now appx. 10 years past menopause and I was having some vaginal bleeding after bowel movements and a few weeks later was due a smear. Nurse saw polyp protruding from cervix. Within a very short time was seen by a Dr who was assisted by nurse at Stobhill. What a difference. Everything was explained and I agreed to them trying to remove the polyp . No entry into the cervix was required at this time. I was reassured that they would stop any time I asked. This was successful with a bit of discomfort but not unbearable.A hysteroscopy was recommended and I agreed provided it was under GA. They explained, then listened and did not dismiss my concerns, and no undue pressure to agree to IUD after I had carried out my own research. Again all appts were very quickly arranged. So far, the outcome is looking very favourable and a very caring Dr. has restored some of my faith in the medical profession. So a huge thank you to the doctor and the staff involved at theatre, recovery and Ward 56 at the Glasgow Royal Infirmary.Would certainly recommend this doctor as a Gynae Consultant!","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-04-01T19:23:30.01","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-04-05T08:52:10.413","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":7}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1049699","id":"1049699"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1049699/responses","id":"1049699"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1049699/healthservices","id":"1049699"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1049699/tags","id":"1049699"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/g107h-ds","id":"G107H-ds","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/g108h-gynaecology","id":"g108h-gynaecology","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ignored","id":"ignored"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20being%20listened%20to","id":"not being listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/traumatic","id":"traumatic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/biopsy","id":"biopsy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cervix","id":"cervix"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctor","id":"doctor"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/explaining","id":"explaining"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gynae","id":"gynae"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hysteroscopy","id":"hysteroscopy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/in%20pain","id":"in pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/information","id":"information"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/menopausal","id":"menopausal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/menopause","id":"menopause"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/polyp","id":"polyp"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/post%20menopausal%20bleeding","id":"post menopausal bleeding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/prompt%20service","id":"prompt service"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/some%20staff","id":"some staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/theatre%20staff","id":"theatre staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/explanations","id":"explanations"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/iud","id":"iud"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/listened%20to","id":"listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/left%20in%20pain","id":"left in pain"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1050706","id":"1050706"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1050870","id":"1050870"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1052650","id":"1052650"}]},{"id":1050544,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Excellent surgery","body":"My recent face to face consultation was very thorough, informative and helpful.

That confusion was laid to rest very quickly as they showed me how very easy and painless any work on the eye could be.  \r\nWith both humour and professional knowledge they quickly boosted my confidence in the procedure's I would be having. I was even given a practical example which was a major relief to me.  \r\nTheir helpfulness and kindness will stay with me for many years to come.  \r\nLikewise, my visit a few minutes later to Mr Muhammed who was the Assistant Specialist Ophthalmologist was enlightening and encouraging.  \r\nUsing language I would understand, he explained clearly what would have to be done and the reasons behind it.  \r\nAt all times I was treated with great courtesy and as an individual. All three made me feel like I was important to them. It may only be an impression... but it meant the world to me while feeling so nervous.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-04-02T11:48:22.18","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-04-05T09:11:24.547","readBy":[{"name":"Royal Cornwall Hospitals NHS Trust","count":6}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1049731","id":"1049731"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1049731/responses","id":"1049731"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1049731/healthservices","id":"1049731"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1049731/tags","id":"1049731"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/ref04-oec","id":"REF04-oec","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confused","id":"confused"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cataract","id":"cataract"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cornea","id":"cornea"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/encouraged","id":"encouraged"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/enlightened","id":"enlightened"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/eyes","id":"eyes"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fearful","id":"fearful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good%20humour","id":"good humour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helpful","id":"helpful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kind","id":"kind"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professional","id":"professional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/quick%20service","id":"quick service"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/transplant","id":"Transplant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confident","id":"confident"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/relieved","id":"relieved"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/opthalmologist","id":"opthalmologist"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20at%20ease","id":"put at ease"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/full%20explanations","id":"full explanations"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/questions%20answered","id":"questions answered"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1051081","id":"1051081"}]},{"id":1049972,"author":"Daire","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Many thanks for the kindness","body":"With a Covid outbreak no visiting has been possible.

We found all the staff we encountered to be very friendly, and there was a nice atmosphere in the department.  \r\nThank you to everyone who played a part in our son's care.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-04-02T11:48:32.05","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-04-05T09:29:20.28","readBy":[{"name":"Southern Health and Social Care Trust","count":5}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1049732","id":"1049732"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1049732/responses","id":"1049732"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1049732/healthservices","id":"1049732"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1049732/tags","id":"1049732"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_32024_420","id":"ZT003_32024_420","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breathing","id":"breathing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breathing%20difficulties","id":"breathing difficulties"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/croup","id":"croup"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctor","id":"doctor"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/efficient","id":"efficient"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good%20with%20children","id":"good with children"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/information","id":"information"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/informed","id":"informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/leaflet","id":"leaflet"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/paediatric","id":"paediatric"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professional","id":"professional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/quick","id":"quick"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thoughtful","id":"thoughtful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/triage","id":"triage"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/triage%20nurse","id":"triage nurse"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/impressed","id":"impressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/information%20leaflet","id":"information leaflet"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/child%20friendly%20explanations","id":"child friendly explanations"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thanks","id":"thanks"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care%20received","id":"care received"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1051006","id":"1051006"}]},{"id":1049969,"author":"Finance Guy who is now watching Blue Lights!","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Amazing service","body":"I have broken my elbow and attended Monklands today.

The reason I was referred was due to heavy periods. I am in my fifties and peri menopausal.  \r\nMy appointment letter explained the procedures that would be carried out and I must admit was apprehensive due to the ‘fear of the unknown’ especially when it advised to take paracetamol an hour before my appointment.  \r\nI was taken in less than 5 minutes upon my arrival at the clinic. Dr Raj then explained what would happen during the examination. This consisted of an internal scan, internal camera examining my womb and fallopian tubes and a sample of my womb lining being taken for further testing. Dr Raj and the nurses present were very friendly and did relax me answering all my questions.  \r\nThe internal scan was like a smear test and very straightforward. Dr Raj inserted numbing lotion or cream and told me if I felt it too uncomfortable I could have a local anaesthetic. When the camera was inserted it was fine until it reached my fallopian tubes. This caused me discomfort however not severe enough to warrant a local anaesthetic. When it came to the section of womb lining being taken, this was over with very quickly, again with slight discomfort. While the examination was being carried out the nurses and Dr Raj continually asked me if I felt ok. I could also have had a coil inserted at the same time to help with my heavy periods, although for unrelated personal reasons I declined. Personally I was glad it was all carried out at the same time and I didn’t have to keep going back to have the procedures done separately.  \r\nAfterwards I felt a bit tender when bending over but no pain so didn’t take any painkillers. The next morning I was back to my normal self with no pain or discomfort at all.  \r\nIf you are referred to Dr Raj’s clinic in University Hospital Wishaw, don’t hesitate to go. The medical team are great and as I said earlier having it all done and dusted during one appointment is a fantastic resource to the community.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-04-02T16:42:35.3066667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-04-05T09:50:03.013","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lanarkshire","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1049765","id":"1049765"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1049765/responses","id":"1049765"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1049765/healthservices","id":"1049765"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1049765/tags","id":"1049765"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l308h_502","id":"L308H_502","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/apprehensive","id":"apprehensive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anaesthetic","id":"Anaesthetic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/camera","id":"camera"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctor","id":"doctor"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly%20staff","id":"friendly staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/glad","id":"glad"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/information","id":"information"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/menopausal","id":"menopausal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/menstrual","id":"menstrual"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/periods","id":"periods"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/prompt%20service","id":"prompt service"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/resource","id":"resource"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/womb","id":"womb"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fantastic","id":"fantastic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/relaxed","id":"relaxed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/explanations","id":"explanations"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/great%20team","id":"great team"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/questions%20answered","id":"questions answered"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1052131","id":"1052131"}]},{"id":1049768,"author":"Niamhh1","authorRoleId":8,"authorRole":"a staff member posting for a patient/service user","title":"Great relationship between staff","body":"I have had a good stay at Lurgan.

We have been waiting for over 9 hours and the only explanation was that they had patients coming overnight and that’s why my mum has had to wait. I am worried that management is in need of some help to manage these issues. If the patient has to wait this long, at least provide something more comfortable to wait as the plastic chairs outside are very uncomfortable for elderly.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-03-29T10:38:02.0733333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-04-05T09:57:56.79","readBy":[{"name":"Mid and South Essex NHS Foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1048373","id":"1048373"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1048373/responses","id":"1048373"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1048373/healthservices","id":"1048373"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1048373/tags","id":"1048373"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/raj32_110","id":"RAJ32_110","score":2},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bed%20management","id":"Bed management"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/knee%20replacement","id":"knee replacement"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nice%20staff","id":"nice staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting%20times","id":"waiting times"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/uncomfortable%20chairs","id":"uncomfortable chairs"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/explanations","id":"explanations"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/administrative%20errors","id":"administrative errors"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1051253","id":"1051253"}]},{"id":1049772,"author":"Warrior29","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Expert neuro team","body":"I recently stayed in the DCN ward 130, after my craniotomy.

This has enabled me to live a life mostly without experiencing symptoms of post-exertional-malaise, to engage in the activities that are important to me and slowly re-build my life in a more sustainable way.The clinical advice was, of course, incredibly helpful but I also really valued being listened to and my experiences being validated.

I cannot thank this wonderful team enough and the nurses in ICU/neonatal who cared for our girls and us for 4 weeks.  \r\nWe were transferred to DHH SCBU for a further 4 weeks and whilst initially we were anxious about the move we were quickly reassured.  \r\nAnna-marie and Mary met us that first evening and I knew straight away our girls would be so well cared for.  \r\nWe had a long journey of 9 weeks in hospital but I cannot begin to thank the staff of DHH SCBU enough for everything they done for our twins and us as parents.  \r\nThe unit was extremely busy and over capacity on occasion yet these nurses had a smile on their face and made time to check in on us, answer all of our questions and care for the babies as if they were their own.  \r\nI have never met a team of people who honestly go above and beyond their job role to make sure that the babies are safe and well looked after and that families are well supported.  \r\nIt was honestly the scariest experience of our lives as one of our twins was quite unwell from birth and we were naturally anxious about how she would present when she was discharged.  \r\nWe need not have worried as the medical and nursing staff ensured we knew how to recognise if there was a deterioration and what to do in the event - they dealt with everything so calmly which certainly rubbed off on us.  \r\nThere are so many to mention but these staff truly deserve more than thanks for what they do each and every day. It is very clearly more than a job to this team and they often worked past their hours, sacrificing their own family lives to care for other families.  \r\nFrom the bottom of our hearts Thank you to Anna-marie, Mary, Niamh, Tracy, Clare, Claire, Vicky, Geraldine, Audrey, Lissy, Sinead and Fionnaula.  \r\nAnd a very special word of thanks to Sister Ann who met us on the first week, introduced herself and from that moment on she radiated positivity and amazing advice to us as anxious parents. Her skills, experience, warmth and empathy was so natural and she was always there to help out and making sure the babies, families and staff were taken care of.  \r\nThe unit was so warm and friendly and the staff could not have done enough for us. I often said how much I would love to go back and work there. And that is testament to the amazing ward sister and staff. They truly are a credit to the SHSCT.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-04-02T17:27:44.66","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-04-05T10:28:27.393","readBy":[{"name":"Southern Health and Social Care Trust","count":13}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1049775","id":"1049775"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1049775/responses","id":"1049775"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1049775/healthservices","id":"1049775"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1049775/tags","id":"1049775"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_32024-delivery-suite","id":"zt003_32024-delivery-suite","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_33020-scbu","id":"ZT003_33020-scbu","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/above%20and%20beyond","id":"above and beyond"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/advice","id":"advice"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/caring%20staff","id":"caring staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/environment","id":"environment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/information","id":"information"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/knowledgeable%20staff","id":"Knowledgeable Staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/neonatal","id":"neonatal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/premature","id":"premature"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/safe","id":"safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scbu","id":"scbu"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/twins","id":"twins"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ward%20sister","id":"ward sister"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing","id":"amazing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/smiles","id":"smiles"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/valued","id":"valued"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wonderful","id":"wonderful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/great%20team","id":"great team"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care%20and%20compassion","id":"care and compassion"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/questions%20answered","id":"questions answered"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/a%20credit","id":"a credit"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1050598","id":"1050598"}]},{"id":1049940,"author":"giraffegn58","authorRoleId":4,"authorRole":"a relative","title":"We are particularly humbled","body":"I’m writing this on behalf of my partner who visited the Minor Injuries unit based within A&E FVRH last night.

Really impressed with the speedy service given the challenges we could see going on around us.  \r\nWe are particularly humbled by a male nurse who was treating another patient in the waiting area. He apologised to her for her lengthy waits and expressed that this is not the way he would wish to care for her given the wait times, lack of patient care areas and number of patients waiting to be seen. He thanked her for her patience and did everything he could to reassure and apologies to her. The staff are doing an amazing job under incredible pressure, which is not appreciated enough.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-04-03T14:09:22.2866667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-04-05T10:29:06.353","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Forth Valley","count":5}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1049940","id":"1049940"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1049940/responses","id":"1049940"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1049940/healthservices","id":"1049940"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1049940/tags","id":"1049940"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/forth-valley-royal-mias","id":"forth-valley-royal-mias","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazed","id":"amazed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing%20care","id":"amazing care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing%20staff","id":"amazing staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/apologetic","id":"apologetic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/check%20in","id":"check in"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good%20job","id":"good job"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/minor%20injuries","id":"minor injuries"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurse","id":"nurse"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/speedy","id":"speedy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/triage","id":"triage"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/x%20ray","id":"x ray"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing","id":"amazing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appreciative","id":"appreciative"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/impressed","id":"impressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20manner","id":"staff manner"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care%20received","id":"care received"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/injuries","id":"injuries"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1051616","id":"1051616"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1052525","id":"1052525"}]},{"id":1049938,"author":"LisaMcA","authorRoleId":7,"authorRole":"a staff member posting for a carer/relative","title":"I am very appreciative of the care given","body":"Comment received from family member of female patient from Derry/Londonderry are.  \r\nMy mother who has Alzheimer's was extremely well looked after.

In early January 2023 he had an amputation to above his knee. A few weeks later I was informed that rehab was not progressing and due to the level of care he needed he would need to go into a care home. My brother was informed of this.  \r\nThroughout his 3 weeks I was told he was in low mood, withdrawn, I asked if he could be given a little more time but this was not an option. A couple of days later, I was informed that my brother was now refusing food, drink and medication. I visited him but he passed away very soon after.  \r\nI feel that due to his mental health he should have had counselling and when informed about the care home I should have been present. He obviously decided to end his life as to him it wasn't worth living. I thought hospitals considered mental health as well as the physical side and feel he was let down. I am still in shock at having lost my brother in such a way. I can only consider this suicide, as he really took his own life.  \r\nThe nurse in the ICU was very helpful and caring as was the nurse in ward 11a.  \r\nI feel a counsellor could have spent time with him to see why he was in a bad place mentally to consider ending his life in this way. Also perhaps it can take longer than 3 weeks for someone who is trying to cope with the shock of losing his leg.","criticality":"strongly

After calling 111 (and receiving great care there) I was told to go to A&E to check all is ok. We waited a short period of time (10-15 mins) when my son was treated by two lovely nurses. Thankfully there was only minor damage to my son's eyes and we were gone with medication in 1 hour.  \r\nAmazing, speedy care considering it was 10:00-11:00pm on a Saturday night. Both nurses were lovely to my son and made him feel at ease (he even received a teddy which he was delighted about).

I am in acute pain right now and struggling to get comfortable to sleep or stay at work so decided to give them a call, only to find out the I can't get a telephone appointment for 8 weeks, not now when I need it. Right now I am struggling to stay at work but try my hardest not to go off sick. I actually work for the NHS and know how much of a drain on them it is when staff are off so push myself as much as I can but right now every day is a struggle.  \r\nMy own department have done everything they can to make things easier for me when at work, standing desk and suitable chair.  \r\nI have previously had an injection into my spine, done in theatre, which got me back on my feet and had agreed to have a 2nd one, roughly a year later, when Covid hit and everything was cancelled. I called a year or so into Covid to so see if things had returned to normal but was told they still weren't doing injections. Since then I have had to carry on only taking meds.  \r\nI am on morphine twice a day as well as a nerve inhibitor. My initial call to them was only to find out if the injections are now going ahead and to be put on their waiting list, but will have to wait the 8 weeks to find that out and then, if they agree and they are, will then have to then go on a waiting list, not knowing how long that will be, before it gets done. This all adds to the time that I am in pain and struggling to cope.  \r\nI know every service is struggling to catch up with waiting times since Covid but a service like the pain clinic it vital to people like me when the pain gets too much and an 8 week wait until I even get to speak to someone I feel is just not great. When I have had to be seen in the past the care I have been given has been first class but actually getting to be seen when pain levels get to be unbearable is just impossible. This totally affects my quality of home and working life. It is having a detrimental affect on my quality of life and I feel like I am existing rather than living. I don't want to become another NHS Statistic and add to the list of staff off sick but don't see me being able to continue this way for much longer. Surely there is a better way of working than this !!!!!!","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-04-03T09:05:41.5866667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-04-05T12:15:11.63","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Forth Valley","count":5},{"name":"Falkirk Health & Social Care Partnership","count":5}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1049826","id":"1049826"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1049826/responses","id":"1049826"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1049826/healthservices","id":"1049826"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1049826/tags","id":"1049826"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/falkirk-ch-pain","id":"falkirk-ch-pain","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frustrated","id":"frustrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sad","id":"sad"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/access%20time","id":"access time"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appointments","id":"appointments"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/availability","id":"availability"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/clinicians","id":"clinicians"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/first%20class%20care","id":"first class care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/in%20pain","id":"in pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/injection","id":"injection"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/morphine","id":"morphine"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain%20clinic","id":"pain clinic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/spine","id":"spine"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/uncomfortable","id":"uncomfortable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting%20list","id":"waiting list"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/struggling","id":"struggling"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%2019","id":"covid 19"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1056208","id":"1056208"}]}]
