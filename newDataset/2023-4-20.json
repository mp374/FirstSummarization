I felt very vulnerable and did not know what the right decision was. I felt like she gave me the time to talk about my feelings, really listened to me, and gave me all the right information to make a decision on the best way to manage the miscarriage. I changed my mind and was made to feel like it was no trouble.  \r\nEverything was organised with no stress for me and I was told about information online from miscarriage association, which helped me to figure things out after I’d had the physical procedure and was still recovering emotionally.  \r\nI cannot thank Sarah and the team enough for their compassionate care and help at a very sad time.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-04-18T20:05:14.62","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-04-20T07:00:45.053","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Tayside","count":7}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1055906","id":"1055906"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1055906/responses","id":"1055906"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1055906/healthservices","id":"1055906"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1055906/tags","id":"1055906"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/t101h_501-epa","id":"T101H_501-EPA","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassionate%20care","id":"compassionate care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/early%20pregnancy","id":"early pregnancy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kind","id":"kind"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/maternity","id":"maternity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/midwife","id":"midwife"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/miscarriage","id":"miscarriage"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scan","id":"scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supportive","id":"supportive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20for","id":"cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/listened%20to","id":"listened to"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1057795","id":"1057795"}]},{"id":1056438,"author":"Jaycee Gee","authorRoleId":2,"authorRole":"a friend","title":"Their kindness & experience shone through","body":"Today I accompanied my friend to an appointment she had with the Rushcliffe Community Respiratory Team. She has had COPD for many years & I have just been diagnosed with it. In fact it was her that first spotted the signs & told me that’s how she started.  \r\nSo after the coughing fits, chest infections, bronchitis, breathing difficulties & all the other things that were going on with me I had blood, breathing & various other tests. She was right, unfortunately I also have COPD. This diagnosis has devastated & to some extent, traumatised me. I know that might sound dramatic, but having little knowledge on the subject except for the awful experiences of my friend, it frightened & panicked me beyond words & left me full of dread & feeling very morbid.  \r\nGetting back to today, this was her second appointment with them & I was there just to support her really.  \r\nI was apprehensive about what I was going into, but tried not to show it because I knew this appointment would be upsetting for my friend & I wanted to be there for her.  \r\nThe two nurses we saw, Elizabeth & Claire, were two of the nicest & understanding nurses I have ever met. They were very knowledgeable & informative, clear, calm, caring & encouraging. They listened without prejudice or judgement & really gave my friend the human touch she so deserves. We both felt that she finally had someone who she could rely on for help & support & who had her best overall interests at heart.  \r\nThey covered a lot of things to help her, & inadvertently me, to manage & live with this awful deliberating disease. They pointed her in the right direction to get further, much needed help & guidance on a variety of subjects that she is trying to deal with. They really know their onions & gave us both a reassurance & hopefulness we didn’t have before the appointment, they understood, acknowledged & advised on every aspect & the affects of learning to adapt to living with COPD. We were both educated & had lots of concerns answered.  \r\nTo anyone who is nervous & anxious, they were a godsend, their kindness & experience shone through.  \r\nIf any of you are ever privileged enough to get an appointment with Elizabeth & Claire, you will be in safe hands, they were wonderful & are a credit to Rushcliffe Community Respiratory Team.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-04-19T19:35:41.65","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-04-20T07:10:28.84","readBy":[{"name":"Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust","count":5}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1056438","id":"1056438"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1056438/responses","id":"1056438"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1056438/healthservices","id":"1056438"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1056438/tags","id":"1056438"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rha20-30404","id":"rha20-30404","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/caring","id":"caring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/copd","id":"copd"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/encouraged","id":"encouraged"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/guidance","id":"guidance"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/informative","id":"informative"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/knowledgeable","id":"knowledgeable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/respiratory","id":"respiratory"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/understanding","id":"understanding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hopeful","id":"hopeful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported","id":"supported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/listened%20to","id":"listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/non-judgemental","id":"non-judgemental"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1056635","id":"1056635"}]},{"id":1056515,"author":"Ratboy's mum","authorRoleId":3,"authorRole":"a parent/guardian","title":"This service saved my son's life","body":"Following numerous appointments to see the GP regarding my concern about my son's lack of food intake, weight loss and suicidal thoughts, he was eventually referred to the CAMHS service.  \r\nThis service saved his life, he would not be alive today had it not been for the prompt assessment and intervention of each health professional we seen during the first appointment in Coathill.  \r\nThe decision was made to admit him to Skye House for assessment and the care from there was amazing. Following discharge he had input from the CITT team, who came to my house every day, offering support to everyone in the house.  \r\nI think we met most staff in the team and my son built up good relationships , especially with James, Evan, Lauren, Sandra and Tricia. As a parent, I naturally blamed myself for his anorexia, but the staff were all very supportive and never judgmental when they visited.  \r\nWe were supplied with lots of resources with insightful information on eating disorders. They also made clear safety plans for my son whenever dark thoughts entered his head. He was discharged from the service yesterday following a year of intensive input from CITT and FBT and I'm delighted to say he is a different boy.  \r\nIt has been the toughest year of his life and the impact it had on our household, work and school was hard at times, but I will be eternally grateful to this service for everything you have all done, we really couldn't have came through this alone. I also want to give special thanks to Alistair for his patience in FBT, and to Marianna who has been with my son since day one.

Addiction gave me injuries, illnesses, humiliation and a constant feeling of uneasiness. By the end, I was trapped in a never-ending Groundhog Day, isolated and in fear of everything and everyone. I was so ill that I became petrified that I would die, but at the same time, I didn’t want to live anymore.  \r\nI have completed several detoxes over the years, many that I have had to beg for, but have always ended up relapsing again and again. I couldn’t break the cycle. My situation was hopeless.  \r\nAfter my last relapse, I went into a private rehab for a month. While in there, I communicated with CGL workers. I now understood that a detox and a few weeks away was not going to be sufficient if I was to hold on to my sobriety. Something needed to change. CGL assured me that they were setting me up on their Day Programme, which I could access as soon as I left the rehab. They also told me about their Anxiety group, which I started remotely while in the treatment centre, and about their Creative group.  \r\nWhen I entered the rehab, I had been too afraid to speak to anyone. The Day Programme would involve daily groups where I would be expected to engage. Although I was fearful, I knew that the uncomfortable feelings I had around this had to be put aside if I was to have any kind of sober future.  \r\nOn leaving the rehab, I started the daily groups. I had already begun to build a trusting relationship with the staff and this helped me with my confidence. I went from having a chaotic lifestyle to have a daily routine where I would be expected to show up and be accountable. As well as developing my own skills to avoid relapse, I also learnt about the value of helping other addicts with their recovery.  \r\nFinally, I started to believe that sobriety did not need to be a temporary thing and that it was something that could be a possibility for me long-term. I began attending 12 step meetings and found a sponsor to support me. I would look forward to and contribute to the groups. My self-esteem started to grow. I enjoyed the trips out we had at Cannon Hill Park and to the city centre during the Commonwealth Games. I got to meet people in person and learnt to have a good time without mind-altering substances. I felt closer to the staff and the group members as a result. I realised that other people could like me for who I am and I made friends.  \r\nThe Anxiety group equipped me with techniques, which I still use in situations today when things become stressful. The Creative writing group showed me that I could actually be good at something.  \r\nSince leaving the Day Programme, I have a much more positive outlook on life. I have been invited to CGL South hub to share my experiences about the 12 steps and recovery, to the women’s group to talk to clients and to the 168 groups. Talking to groups of strangers would not have been possible a year ago. Now, at almost a year free of all mind-altering substances, I am eternally grateful to the staff who believed in me and who continue to believe in me.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-04-19T22:56:05.7166667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-04-20T07:29:35.17","readBy":[{"name":"Change Grow Live","count":5}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1056517","id":"1056517"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1056517/responses","id":"1056517"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1056517/healthservices","id":"1056517"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1056517/tags","id":"1056517"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/nms-cglb-south","id":"nms-cglb-south","score":4},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/addiction","id":"addiction"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/meeting%20people","id":"meeting people"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/new%20skills","id":"New skills"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/positive","id":"positive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/rehab","id":"rehab"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/routine","id":"routine"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confident","id":"confident"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported","id":"supported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/addiction%20recovery","id":"addiction recovery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/creative%20group","id":"creative group"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/group%20meetings","id":"group meetings"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1060820","id":"1060820"}]},{"id":1055183,"author":"indiahw66","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Fantastic staff at 111","body":"I had a cough and cold for 1 month,then Sunday I became very wheezy and slightly short of breath so I rang 111 after speaking to 3 lovely people.

All done within 15 minutes then back to the bay for blood tests and ECG.  \r\nVisit by consultant neurologist within the hour and then check-ups with doctor/nurses until the result of the scan and bloods were known. Prescription issued, letter to my surgery prepared and I was home within 4 hrs or so. Could not have had more urgent attention or more care shown. Friendly, reassuring, caring - top service.

When I was in the bathroom at 12.15 pm the consultant had tried to phone me presumably, as there was a missed call from the withheld number.  \r\nAfter no further calls were received I contacted the appointments office, I was recorded as a DNA/did not attend. And I was told it looked like I’d been discharged. Having waited since last August for a review appointment, finding out my original consultant had left & having to get my GP to do another referral, I feel absolutely devastated. I have a very painful chronic condition. The person I spoke to in appointments was so kind to me when I was upset, they said they were sending an email & gave me the secretary’s number. So at least that was something positive.  \r\nI’d previously spoken to a manager and had emailed the appointments office yesterday inquiring if I could have a face to face meeting. Hopefully perhaps a cancellation had become available etc. On both occasions I was advised that a telephone appointment was the only option.  \r\nDoctors who are marking patients as DNA are bound to be well aware of the struggles for patients to be seen in the NHS & private sector. I think there should be a more professional and certainly more humane way of treating people who are unwell and vulnerable. I hope this leads to a change for other patients.  \r\n","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-04-18T16:02:26.5033333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-04-20T08:34:07.823","readBy":[{"name":"Belfast Health and Social Care Trust","count":8}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1055737","id":"1055737"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1055737/responses","id":"1055737"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1055737/healthservices","id":"1055737"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1055737/tags","id":"1055737"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt001_12036_502","id":"ZT001_12036_502","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frustrated","id":"frustrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/devastated","id":"devastated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gynaecology","id":"gynaecology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/review","id":"review"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/office%20staff","id":"office staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/telephone%20appointments","id":"telephone appointments"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1058089","id":"1058089"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1059621","id":"1059621"}]},{"id":1055590,"author":"magpiezw59","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"A great Service","body":"I had a great service.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-04-18T10:45:33.7066667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-04-20T08:34:52.307","readBy":[{"name":"North Lanarkshire Health & Social Care Partnership","count":12}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1055590","id":"1055590"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1055590/responses","id":"1055590"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1055590/healthservices","id":"1055590"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1055590/tags","id":"1055590"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/nlhscp-mothwerwell-troom","id":"nlhscp-Mothwerwell-troom","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happy","id":"happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/service","id":"service"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/phlebotomy%20service","id":"phlebotomy service"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1057200","id":"1057200"}]},{"id":1055596,"author":"aprilxs56","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Excellent experience","body":"My experience has been excellent.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-04-18T10:54:32.0533333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-04-20T08:35:58.67","readBy":[{"name":"North Lanarkshire Health & Social Care Partnership","count":11}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1055596","id":"1055596"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1055596/responses","id":"1055596"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1055596/healthservices","id":"1055596"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1055596/tags","id":"1055596"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/nlhscp-mothwerwell-troom","id":"nlhscp-Mothwerwell-troom","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/claudication","id":"claudication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/great%20experience","id":"Great experience"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happy","id":"happy"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1057202","id":"1057202"}]},{"id":1055597,"author":"paprikasw67","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"No long waiting times","body":"On time, no long waiting times.

Upon further research and speaking with specialists, I've discovered it's not at all and that this is an urgent matter with potential for brain and spinal causes.  \r\nUpon calling back I was advised they could do a referral for an MRI but not as a matter of urgency. I've now received a follow up appointment for 6 months' times (despite the consultant having said they would call to check in in 2 weeks..they haven't).  \r\nThis is a child who was fully continent for 8+ years and has never as much as wet the bed now lives in nappies and this change was overnight. There was no support offered such as how we manage in between times, anything to look out for, details of the incontinence team who could prescribe necessary pads.  \r\nI called recently to check the progress of the ultrasound, to be advised they were waiting on a new rota so only just received that appointment now. Meanwhile I have a terrified and confused pre-teen with rapidly dwindling mental health due to this.

There were no disinfectant wipes on board the Obs trolley, and staff had to be asked to clean the equipment, each & every time they came to the bedside to check my Obs. This is a very basic infection control requirement & not taking the necessary steps to prevent the spread of infection in a Hospital setting is inexcusable.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-04-18T19:48:17.2233333","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2023-04-20T09:20:00.31","readBy":[{"name":"Surrey and Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust","count":6}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1055899","id":"1055899"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1055899/responses","id":"1055899"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1055899/healthservices","id":"1055899"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1055899/tags","id":"1055899"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rtp04_430","id":"RTP04_430","score":2},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20risk","id":"at risk"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/elderly","id":"elderly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fearful","id":"fearful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hygiene","id":"hygiene"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/infection","id":"infection"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/infection%20control","id":"infection control"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/uneasy","id":"uneasy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vulnerable","id":"vulnerable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/observations","id":"observations"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/noisy%20ward","id":"noisy ward"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%2019","id":"covid 19"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ward%20lighting","id":"ward lighting"}]},{"id":1055732,"author":"earthtd97","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"There’s nothing to fault them with at all","body":"The Covid clinic was all good really. I had no problem whatsoever with it. I was supposed to have gone for a cancer review. I did a Covid test with one of the new tests at the hospital and that turned out to be positive after I had taken a negative lateral flow.  \r\nAfter this, I was invited to the Covid clinic for maybe some other tests and potential treatment. And I guess all of this experience was good. I didn't try the treatments because I showed no real symptoms. I was on no other medication for Cancer treatment and they didn't think there'd be much point going ahead with the Covid treatment. The staff were good and supportive. Communication was good and the called me back promptly to let me know that I wouldn't be taking treatment for Covid.  \r\nThe lady who called me was very helpful and sent me a text number to message them if the symptoms got more serious or worse. We also spoke after the weekend and another lateral flow showed I was negative.  \r\nMy wife can’t have any vaccines or boosters; and was recommended not to touch the vaccines by Dr as she had previously had a reaction to a flu vaccines. And I wondered if it would be helpful for people who can’t have vaccines to have access to this service. My and my wife have previously had Covid. My wife ended up in hospital about 5-7 days after initial confirmation and spent nearly a week in the hospital and so I think would be a good candidate for this service in this circumstance. We have spoken to other professionals but no one seems to have any answers, so I think it is worth mentioning here-I think it needs to be highlighted and people who can't have vaccines need to not be forgotten about.  \r\nBut the Trust in my case have been absolutely brilliant, including dealing with my prostrate cancer (the operation for this was performed at Exeter hospital and was excellent).My tumour in the colon was dealt with at Devon and they looked after me excellently. Barnstaple have looked after me since and I can’t thank them and praise them enough. The surgeon, the team and the staff in general-there’s nothing to fault them at all.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-04-18T15:37:26.0666667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-04-20T09:23:21.69","readBy":[{"name":"Royal Devon University Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust","count":5}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1055732","id":"1055732"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1055732/responses","id":"1055732"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1055732/healthservices","id":"1055732"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1055732/tags","id":"1055732"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rh880-covid-swabbing-unit","id":"RH880-covid-swabbing-unit","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/follow%20up","id":"follow up"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helpful","id":"helpful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/prompt","id":"prompt"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supportive","id":"supportive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid-19%20treatment","id":"covid-19 treatment"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1059707","id":"1059707"}]},{"id":1055693,"author":"tangogy64","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Too many cooks when trying to contact physio","body":"I had a physio appointment but the road was closed and there was no buses.

I got induced and the pain kicked in so quickly. I was rushed into the labour ward and given an epidural. In less than a few minutes one of the staff snatched it of me, as if I was not deserving , no explanation or anything just like that.  \r\nI was in so much pain that I could not hold it in. One of the staff turned back to me and said look at me , listen to me stop screaming and push, no empathy whatsoever. I will never forget how angry they looked when they said that. They told me to push - I pushed. When I pushed they said not like that! No-one had explained to me how I was suppose to push, then one of them said push as if you are doing a poo, however they seemed concerned about when last I had opened my bowels.  \r\nI was in pain. The thing I wanted was to get the baby out, not being asked when last I opened my bowels. When I pushed the way they had told me which was only one push chance they gave me, they told me they were going to help me. They put some stuff to support my legs. After that I remember the doctor twisting my inside. It was so painful , more than the labour pain , I asked what they were doing? All of a sudden I heard them shouting, holding a small syringe, and saying they were removing urine from my bladder.  \r\nIt has been over six months now that pain is still there. Just as I thought I had seen enough, the baby was born. When the midwife was handing over my baby, they called her monkey? They all laughed. I had already lost my self esteem from the way they had handled me when I was giving birth.  \r\nWhen it was time to go to the ward , the midwife, asked if they could dress my baby while I change. I agreed and then I hear them saying monkey, hello monkey, repeating themselves. This time I got angry and I confronted them. They asked what her name was and I told them. They looked at me as if my baby was not deserving of that name.  \r\nWhen it was time to go to the ward , they asked if I could walk to the ward. I said no - I was anaemic and had just given birth. They brought a chair and pushed me to the ward , no communication whatsoever. It was the worst experience of my life , I will never forget it. No respect or empathy.  \r\nThey was only one member of staff at the end who came and apologised for the epidural being taken off me. When I was transferred to a post birth ward, the midwife who attended to me , asked if I was ok, because another midwife had told her about the treatment I had received in the labour ward. I could not answer much as I was so angry. When I rang and complained to the trust, they told me the midwife had left the trust and they were going to speak to the rest of the team .  \r\nMy beautiful, angelic , one in a million baby fills our hearts with so much joy, I’m glad God gave her to us.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-04-19T03:07:49.4266667","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2023-04-20T10:30:39.887","readBy":[],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1056080","id":"1056080"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1056080/responses","id":"1056080"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1056080/healthservices","id":"1056080"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1056080/tags","id":"1056080"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/ras01_501","id":"RAS01_501","score":1},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/angry","id":"angry"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/should%20listen","id":"Should listen"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/epidural","id":"epidural"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/giving%20birth","id":"giving birth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/in%20pain","id":"in pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/manners","id":"manners"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/maternity","id":"maternity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain%20relief","id":"pain relief"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professionalism","id":"professionalism"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/self%20esteem","id":"self esteem"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attitude","id":"staff attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/explanations","id":"explanations"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lack%20of%20empathy","id":"lack of empathy"}]},{"id":1056687,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Great experience ","body":"Just wanted to say how good my experience was today at The Jubilee Day Surgery department.

Throughout the journey of his operation, the care given by all staff was 5*. And this counts towards every single staff member. Jess and Gill on Caroline Thorpe ward are absolutely amazing, their duty of care towards children and parents/guardians was to the best standard. The play specialist (I didn’t catch a name), was so helpful and engaging. Then there was the sleepy doctors team (as they called themselves) who put my son to sleep at such ease, it wasn’t traumatic for him and me at all! I felt at such ease and knew my son was being looked after so well. His surgeon, Mr. Gibbon, made every effort to meet my son’s needs and was so calming and reassuring. He has done a fantastic job and I am truly thankful.  \r\nThe team in recovery department were fantastic and calming when my son came around. My son found it quite frightening at first and they were so lovely towards us, and wasn’t phased at all. I didn’t catch a name, but the lady in particular was a wonderful woman who made sure he was comfortable. The porter who came to get my son from the recovery room to Caroline Thorpe ward, was so chatty and nice. A really lovely chap.  \r\nAfter a very long day, my son got given tea and as there was food leftover, the caterer (who gives food out on the wards) gave me some tea as well (I was very hungry as I didn’t want to upset my son by eating in front of him!) This was such a nice thing to do and I felt so looked after by all of the team. The food was lovely!!  \r\nThe hospital is an absolute credit to the NHS. Through these uncertain times, this hospital defies all odds and I am truly grateful.  \r\nJust a huge thank you for looking after my son yesterday… I couldn’t have asked for better even if I was a private paying patient.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-04-19T08:57:43.8766667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-04-20T10:44:28.083","readBy":[{"name":"Royal Devon University Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust","count":7}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1056114","id":"1056114"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1056114/responses","id":"1056114"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1056114/healthservices","id":"1056114"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1056114/tags","id":"1056114"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rh880_171","id":"RH880_171","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rh880_420","id":"RH880_420","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/eye%20surgery","id":"Eye surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/food","id":"food"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helpful","id":"helpful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/in%20good%20hands","id":"in good hands"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/level%20of%20care","id":"level of care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/operation","id":"operation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgeon","id":"surgeon"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/well%20looked%20after","id":"well looked after"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happy","id":"happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassuring","id":"reassuring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thankful","id":"Thankful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20at%20ease","id":"put at ease"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/credit%20deserved","id":"credit deserved"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/a%20credit","id":"a credit"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1060403","id":"1060403"}]},{"id":1056700,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Professional staff across the board","body":"At the moment I am still in hospital following an unexpected overnight stay.

Still, I've been with the Tring practice my whole life and even after they started expanding, they've always been focussed on getting the right help for their

I was confused because I already had a meeting arranged, so my dad texted them back asking if it was still on and they said no because I asked them to speak to someone.  \r\nI phoned my social worker angry, asking if all appointments were cancelled then I went quiet. They decided to hang up the phone and texted saying that they had no opportunity to answer me. When they did the next appointment, they didn’t turn up at my house. They texted my dad to say that they were not going as I blocked their number.  \r\nI ended up self harming and feeling suicidal all because of my social worker. I phoned to ask to talk to the duty worker. No response for almost 2 weeks as the admin staff put it through to my social worker who in turned didn’t phone on the day they were meant to turn up. I got the blame of phoning 100 times where there’s no evidence that it was me and they told my dad about it.  \r\nSocial worker has failed to get the support sorted out in a timely manner, as I didn’t like the person who was supporting me. Now the social worker only emailed the manager of the company and nothing was getting done about it. Earlier last month, still nothing. Still accepting that they are still finding someone so I texted the manager saying that they didn’t care if I got support or not and my social worker got me into trouble, saying this is not how to deal with it.  \r\nAfter the holiday, my social worker turned around and said that the company can’t find anyone else to support me now. I’m struggling without it and it feels like the social worker doesn’t care if I self harm or feel suicidal. It has gotten to the point where if they mess me around one more time I’m going to overdose as they seem to get away with not doing anything. I have tried to talk to the social worker manager. They have not returned the phone call when they spoke to my dad which isn’t on either.  \r\nAll my relationships with the CMHT has ended in the same way, where I overdose because they mess me around not turn up for appointments make excuses etc. I've been with them for years and now I was wrongly diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and I now have autism. I find this unreal.","criticality":"strongly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-04-01T21:41:28.8433333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-04-20T11:07:21.567","readBy":[{"name":"Angus Health and Social Care Partnership","count":11}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1049702","id":"1049702"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1049702/responses","id":"1049702"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1049702/healthservices","id":"1049702"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1049702/tags","id":"1049702"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/s37000003-chpcs-mental-health-services-ncmht","id":"S37000003-chpcs-mental-health-services-NCMHT","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/angry","id":"angry"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confused","id":"confused"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appointments","id":"appointments"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/autism","id":"autism"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/borderline%20personality%20disorder","id":"Borderline Personality Disorder"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cancelled","id":"cancelled"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/relationships","id":"relationships"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/social%20worker","id":"Social Worker"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/suicidal","id":"suicidal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20angry","id":"very angry"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/inconsistent%20care","id":"inconsistent care"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1057276","id":"1057276"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1057298","id":"1057298"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1058041","id":"1058041"}]},{"id":1056728,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Good experience","body":"I needed an appointment so I rang around 8am, after 25 min I talked to the lovely receptionist and managed one on the same day.
