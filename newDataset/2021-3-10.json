Had a call in December with a nurse, who was incredible rude, just spoke over me the entire phone call, I barely said a sentence, prescribed me something that had nothing to do with the reason I called. This is the kind of GP practice that you just learn to live with you problem because it is pure hassle trying to deal with these people, and that’s exactly what I’ve done in this case.  Despite selecting a chemist, my prescription is sent to a different one everytime, doctors/nurses claim prescription will be ready in around 3 days, but realistically it’s about 7 if youre lucky, even then your standing outside the chemist on the phone to the doctors asking them why is hasn’t been sent over, so then you have to wait for a doctor to respond to a urgent message the receptionist sends them, so they can quickly sort it out. \nZero communication between staff and patients, ordered a repeat prescription for the pill about 10 days before I was due to run out, all seemed fine advised should be ready in 3 days, prescription wasn’t ready after about 5 days, so rung the practice who then informed me I needed a pill check but couldnt get me in for at least a week. No one even thought to call to say I needed this check! Another time I was advised by a nurse she would get the reception to call to arrange an appointment with a doctor, heard nothing, rung the practice and they had booked an appointment for 3 weeks time and didn’t even let me know! \n\nIt’s shocking the reviews on here are favourable to the practice. So I urge you to check out places people are more likely to leave reviews. For example google.  \nA recent inspection quoted that the patient satisfaction had risen, I have no idea where that has come from considering I been a patient at this surgery for 20 years and not once been asked about my experience here! If questionnaires were given out in waiting rooms, then these people were just relieved they actually managed to get an appointment. \nConsidering I only use my GP for repeat pill prescription and very rarely for anything else it speaks volumes that I have had so many problems with this surgery.

Was offered general anaesthetic as I’m such a lightweight when it comes to people poking my eyes (it’s why I have never been able to wear contacts). Despite all the extra COVID precautions I was in and out in under 8 hours even after general. Absolutely straightforward and pain free. The hardest bit for me was getting the wee pellet under my lower eyelid. The staff could not have been more reassuring. I took eye drops for 2 weeks after and apart from a wee bit of stickiness for a few days my left eye made full recovery. I can honestly say as an older male getting my eye sorted has been life changing. I can now drive without glasses (and walk round Tesco fully masked without specs). I still need to wear cheap reading glasses for close up work. Next year I get my right eye done.  \r\nThank you Hairmyres and thank you NHS Scotland.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-03-08T08:54:45.0033333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-03-10T10:21:21.6","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lanarkshire","count":7},{"name":"Voluntary Action North Lanarkshire","count":1},{"name":"Partnership for Change","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/830389","id":"830389"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/830389/responses","id":"830389"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/830389/healthservices","id":"830389"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/830389/tags","id":"830389"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l302h_130","id":"L302H_130","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anaesthetic","id":"Anaesthetic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/caring","id":"caring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cataract%20surgery","id":"Cataract surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/eye%20drops","id":"eye drops"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/eyes","id":"eyes"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain%20free","id":"pain free"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/walk","id":"walk"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassuring","id":"reassuring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/timely%20treatment","id":"timely treatment"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/830973","id":"830973"}]},{"id":830381,"author":"FV89","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Out of hours doctor being extremely rude","body":"I had my vaccination a few days ago and have had a reaction to it causing me to barely be able to move my arm. I phoned NHS 24 and they referred me to my local health service and when I was called back, I spoke to the rudest doctor I have ever had to deal with.  \r\nAfter my Covid vaccination, I was wiped out but in a lot of pain with my arm. Around the injection site had become inflamed and hot with a bump and a lot of pain. It’s been very difficult to sleep on or do anything with. I phoned looking for help and advice from a doctor and explained how the paracetamol I had been told to take was not doing anything. I felt that the doctor then spoke down to me, telling me that everyone has different reactions to vaccines, how they weren't concerned about my arm, how they wouldn’t do anything and how I would just be wasting their time if I went to see them about it. When I coughed, they accused me of laughing at them and got even ruder, saying if I was just going to laugh at them then there’s not point. In the end, after having spent 5 minutes being insulted and spoken down to, I told them that instead of being spoken to like that, that I would phone my GP in the morning instead. And their response was just fine, do what you want.  \r\nI understand we should be supporting the NHS. But when doctors think that it is acceptable to speak to a patient like this, what is meant to happen? The doctors are to be treated with respect yet this doctor, whose name I did not catch, did not treat me with respect and was quite happy to interrupt me, talk down to me and be extremely rude to me when I was looking for some help.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-03-08T02:31:33.8433333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-03-10T10:23:36.33","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Forth Valley","count":8},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2021)","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/830381","id":"830381"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/830381/responses","id":"830381"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/830381/healthservices","id":"830381"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/830381/tags","id":"830381"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/forth-valley-royal-gpooh","id":"forth-valley-royal-gpooh","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/angry","id":"angry"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/insulted","id":"insulted"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/advice","id":"advice"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/arm","id":"arm"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/injection","id":"injection"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/polite","id":"polite"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/respect","id":"respect"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/telephone%20manner","id":"telephone manner"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vaccination","id":"vaccination"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset%20and%20sore","id":"upset and sore"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid","id":"covid"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%20vaccine","id":"covid vaccine"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unhelpful%20comments","id":"unhelpful comments"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/831638","id":"831638"}]},{"id":830398,"author":"grim","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Infusions for my crohns","body":"I go to South Tyrone hospital every 8 weeks for infusions.

I have been offered appointments ahead of when I was due to return which again has helped greatly.  \r\nThe care and service that all the staff have provided has been wonderful and I feel has helped having the continuity of being able to return to the clinic rather than a my GP.","criticality":"minimally critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-03-09T11:10:52.2333333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-03-10T10:42:54.3","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lothian","count":4}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/830730","id":"830730"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/830730/responses","id":"830730"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/830730/healthservices","id":"830730"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/830730/tags","id":"830730"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/lauriston-building","id":"lauriston-building","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/continuity","id":"continuity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dermatology","id":"dermatology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/efficient","id":"efficient"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/head","id":"head"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helped","id":"helped"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helpful","id":"helpful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/important","id":"important"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lump","id":"lump"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/parking","id":"parking"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/flexible","id":"Flexible"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20worried","id":"not worried"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/833300","id":"833300"}]},{"id":830809,"author":"SRCM","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Gynaecology and endometriosis","body":"I would like to give my thanks to Dr Buck and her team at Crosshouse Hospital gynaecology department.

She listened to me and found the root of my problems after I had been dismissed by so many before.  \r\nShe has a very caring and calming demeanor and happily answered all the questions I had throughout my care with her. I tend to get myself worked up around medical appointments but she always put my mind at ease. I was also always kept informed about every aspect of my care which made me feel included in the care I received and that I had a voice that mattered. She is very thorough in her work and had no issue referring me to departments that she felt I needed. All the staff that work with her that I met at appointments and my time as an inpatient where extremely supportive and a real credit to the department. It was also always easy to get in touch with her secretary, Mandy, who was always so helpful and kind whenever I called. I felt completely safe in Dr Bucks care and I am forever grateful to her and her team for all the care and support that I have received.

Initially admitted following vomiting of old blood that quickly progressed to complete kidney failure. The staff in ED were calm and thorough in assessing mum, importantly allowing us to tell them how well she normally is with good health and high quality of life for her years. Thanks to Dr Nicholl and Sr Jill For their professional reassurance she was in safe hands. Sent to theatre that evening special shout out to the night nurses in ED Amy and Ashley who kept in contact to let us know how she was.  \r\nAfter a scary post procedure period, off to ward 1 South. Again the nurses made calls on most days to provide updates. This is so so important as it it near on impossible to get through to the ward. She is home now and our family grateful for the care she received. All the nursing staff and physios on ward 1 south were great. With special mention to SN Alaina ( hope that spelling is right) who contacted us regularly and her kindness in her voice as well as her actions. Mum says all the nurses were very good and the soup ( ‘second to none’) that helped her recovery. Please thank the catering staff. Very special mention to Dr Baird who managed mums kidney function, kept a close eye and kept us up to date with progress. Also diabetes nurse special Rachel who provided us with virtual training for mums new insulin regime at home.  \r\nThe key thread in this review is the critical role that regular updates play in building trust and putting families at ease during what is a very anxious time for families when loved ones are in hospital and you can’t visit. Even at times when there is nothing new to report - that’s ok it still has value for the family, still make contact just to say no change. Days with no contact are anxious days and I imagine this is especially so if loved ones are not on the recovery journey.  \r\nAt 87 it was mums first admission to hospital and she would like us to thank everyone involved in her care and while the soup was terrific she hopes not to be tasting it again too soon! Thank you on behalf of our family for building her up and returning her to us so we can enjoy more precious times at home.","criticality":"not

I suffer from several prolapsed discs (neuropathy, mobility and cognitive impairment), there has been no referral regarding MS or any other conditions and I have pain managed via Gabapentin. It's not ideal, as it really only masks the symptoms.  \r\nPart of this is potentially due to the fact that I am classed as morbidly obese. At 5'11 (roughly, damage to discs may have altered this) and 25 stone (ish) I've never been at an ideal weight. Any time I seek help, my weight is mentioned. Ever single time. Including the most recent conversation via a phone call to the pain clinic, whose final assessment was to lose weight and continue taking medication. As you may imagine for me this is disheartening, depressing and frankly, useless.  \r\nThe idea that weight loss has never been attempted or even addressed in my opinion is insulting and reminds me of the stereotypes of those who are overweight. Not to mention the inherent judgment that I feel appears to proceed with all conversations even before I've begun to speak. While perhaps not truly a cultural problem it is a stigma that persists wherever I go - and not solely for myself but others as well.  \r\nOver time, I have attempted calorie-controlled diets, restricted plans, and other well known diet plans. These were successful but not for the long-term as a permanent solution, given the process involves not eating until you approach your ideal weight - which, again, I have never been at any point in my life, excepting potentially early childhood.  \r\nWith a family history of the same, along with a heritage that files me under the high-risk factors associated with type 2 diabetes, being overweight, my age, and also that I have black Caribbean heritage, all increase my concerns. Sadly, for some reason, I do not qualify for any help with respect to surgical options which I have been informed are my only remaining choice. Nor do I have access to the kinds of money that will allow me to access it privately.  \r\nAs one of those who fall into the category of failing to be quite 'sick' enough, it is a difficult decision to believe could ever be acceptable. I feel it would be better to offer me help now, before further conditions, which cost millions - according to the recent data reported across the NHS - to treat and manage, or even to provide the means of a way for those like myself to fund that treatment with some financial help. Being able to support the NHS is not a problem for me but at the moment I need something of the same kind of support and consideration in return.  \r\nSo, can anyone help me? Is there any recourse available to someone like me? And if not, why is that?","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-03-07T22:44:38.02","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-03-10T12:05:27.74","readBy":[{"name":"Buckinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust","count":1},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2022)","count":1},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2021)","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/830372","id":"830372"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/830372/responses","id":"830372"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/830372/healthservices","id":"830372"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/830372/tags","id":"830372"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rxq81","id":"RXQ81","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/concern","id":"concern"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/insulting","id":"insulting"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/afraid","id":"afraid"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/alone","id":"alone"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/chronic%20pain","id":"chronic pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cognitive%20impairment","id":"cognitive impairment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diabetes","id":"diabetes"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diet","id":"diet"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fall","id":"fall"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/forgotten","id":"forgotten"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/help","id":"help"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ideas","id":"ideas"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/loss%20of%20weight","id":"loss of weight"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mobility","id":"mobility"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ms","id":"ms"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/neuropathy","id":"neuropathy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/obese","id":"obese"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/overweight","id":"overweight"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain%20clinic","id":"pain clinic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain%20management","id":"pain management"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/weight","id":"weight"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/weight%20loss","id":"weight loss"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20disappointed","id":"very disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/referrals","id":"referrals"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lost","id":"lost"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/further%20resources","id":"further resources"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/833389","id":"833389"}]},{"id":830804,"author":"positivity76","authorRoleId":1,"authorRole":"a carer","title":"Podiatry services","body":"My father had multiple health conditions but was seen by podiatry initially at Gransha but then got moved to Altnagelvin hospital out patients (this worked better for us anyway)  \r\nThe podiatrist was phenomenal, he knew there was a problem with my father's toe and he made it 'his project' to get to the bottom of what was going on.

She had been suffering from a urine infection which the GP had suspected has made her septic. Eventually, she was admitted to ARU5 around 8pm and due to the pandemic we were not allowed to be with her- she has a failing cochlear implant and is almost deaf so lip reads which is challenging as staff wear masks. She is 85 years old. The family were concerned and anxious to hear news so I was nominated as the spokes person and called the unit.  \r\nThe first thing which struck me was the numerous times I had to call before someone answered the phone and the nurses never identified who they were but each one calls themselves “staff nurse” I believe it is good manners to identify yourself as I did on the occasions when I called. When I asked how my mum was I was advised that I could only be given limited information due to confidentiality and the doctor was still to see her despite being reviewed in A&E and SATTA. I asked to speak to the person in charge- who said he was the Charge Nurse- again no name however, he was far more helpful and empathetic.  \r\nWhen someone you love dearly has been taken to hospital, particularly during this pandemic, the patient and family are anxious and upset. I am my mother’s advocate and voice at a time when she has none. I have read that each day an elderly patient remains in hospital a day adds a year to their life. I did not ask the nursing staff for specific details but I did want to know what was wrong and what was her treatment. I was not offered any communication with her although I did ask about the use of an iPad to face time and was advised to call back the following day.  \r\nI thought the NHS motto was “Be Kind” I ask for compassion for my mother a basic attribute for all nurses.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-03-10T07:59:52.9633333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-03-10T12:15:19.537","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":5},{"name":"St. Andrews University ScotGEM Medical Students","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/830938","id":"830938"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/830938/responses","id":"830938"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/830938/healthservices","id":"830938"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/830938/tags","id":"830938"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sj9-south-glasgow-hospital-aru","id":"SJ9-south-glasgow-hospital-aru","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/urosepsis","id":"urosepsis"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/831339","id":"831339"}]},{"id":830822,"author":"Ben62","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Phlebotomy staff member made me cry","body":"I have a telephone appointment with Dr Al-Jehani at clinical haematology and I needed to have a blood test prior to my appointment. I checked on my phone and saw that the phlebotomy department opened until 7. 30pm. I arrived at the department at just before 5 o'clock due to lots of traffic. I had to get the bus and was very anxious as I’ve been shielding as I have COPD and a care for my severely disabled daughter. this is the first time I’ve got the bus since March last year. The department was locked. Another patient was coming out with a staff member behind them I asked why it was shut? The staff member was so rude to me in response, I felt really upset. They then told me to go to A& E they can do it. As I walked away the last patient who was leaving said to me that they should not have spoken to me like that it was rude abrupt and unnecessary. I was so upset. I walked round to A& E and was told there was no way they could do my blood test. I just felt very anxious upset and I cried all the way home on the bus. I can’t face going back again and I have emailed my consultant to reschedule my appointment. I feel so let down by my experience and totally demoralised by the whole thing.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-03-09T19:30:55.4766667","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2021-03-10T12:18:44.563","readBy":[],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/830822","id":"830822"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/830822/responses","id":"830822"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/830822/healthservices","id":"830822"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/830822/tags","id":"830822"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rj611_303","id":"RJ611_303","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxious","id":"anxious"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/abrupt","id":"abrupt"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/attitude","id":"attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood","id":"blood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20test","id":"blood test"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disabled","id":"disabled"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/face","id":"face"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/rude","id":"rude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20member","id":"staff member"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/test","id":"test"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20manner","id":"staff manner"}]},{"id":830970,"author":"Batty56","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"A Colonoscopy","body":"I turned up for appointment an absolute wreck with nerves, l was greeted by a lovely nurse called Sharon she was so caring and understood my fears.

That, and the sedation, was carried out by the team in a really relaxed and friendly atmosphere. I chatted during the pre op preps, and almost forgot I was about to have the actual procedure. I was asleep and unaware throughout the operation which took just over an hour. \nNo general anaesthetic meant no fuzziness coming round and nothing lingering in my system; a good kick start for recovery. I was able to weight bear the same day which also boosted my confidence . \nMy wound was very small and is now a 6\" line scar. I had no bruising at all, and the stitches were all the dissolving kind, so no removal required. All very neat and clean.\nIt is lovely to be free of pain, to be able to sleep comfortably again and to have so much more energy. There is lots to look forward to and enjoy again and I feel years younger!\nI have no hesitation in recommending the wonderful hip team at the Montefiore. Their brilliant way of replacing hips means a much faster and more comfortable recovery. I feel lucky and privileged to have benefited from the skills of this top class team.
