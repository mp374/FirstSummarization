However, due to the COVID pandemic the wait for surgery was prolonged. I was also aware that surgery in my local trust had a backlog of up to 2 years. &nbsp; In June this year the CCG contacted me with a view to having surgery with Ramsey Health Care, New Hall Hospital in Salisbury. Amazingly I had the surgery in August with excellent results. The whole experience was efficient and professional.

","body":"I know that like every practice pear tree has issues with getting through on the phone. However, unlike many gp practices this surgery has kept it’s doors open throughout covid, so patients have always had a direct means of contact. Others I know of have just locked their doors and waiting times on the phone have been up to 2 hours. Pear tree also seem to have installed a new phone service, which now tells you where you are in the queue- a big improvement! This practice has worked so hard to get patients vaccinated- their staff were there efficiently running the clinics, so inevitably must have worked such long hours. I have no doubt they are going to be just as effective at delivering the coming booster jabs. Equally I have  also found they have remained reliable at dealing with any urgent situations with phone calls returned and any necessary action taken the same day. The delivery service for repeat prescriptions is totally reliable. I think patients of pear tree should also appreciate the regular reviews of repeat items that not all gp’s carry out. These reviews might occasionally seem a nuisance, but they are great opportunities to discuss any problems with a gp. I could have stayed on some meds for years with my previous Gp without anyone ever checking how I was doing. I wish patients could be more patient, understanding and tolerant of blips in the system when I know staff are doing their best. If staff appear “lazy” because they are not attending the phone or reception it might well be because they have been asked to deal with other areas of work- a lot has to go on behind the scenes too to progress patients needs. Also we are all human, so inevitably some mistakes will occur- can we not be a little more tolerant and understanding where professionals are doing their best.  If there are any truly worrying incidents of course they must be reported, but otherwise why not just be polite and thankful that we have a gp service that I guarantee is better than many others. There is a patient group that you could join to to help improve services- of course everything can always use positive suggestions to improve.\n\n","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2021-09-24T18:52:04","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2021-09-25T11:54:49","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/880891","id":"880891"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/880891/responses","id":"880891"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/880891/healthservices","id":"880891"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/880891/tags","id":"880891"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/m84006","id":"M84006","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nuisance","id":"nuisance"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/delivery","id":"delivery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/great","id":"great"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/group","id":"group"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/positive","id":"positive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thankful","id":"Thankful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid","id":"covid"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%2019","id":"covid 19"}]},{"id":880892,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Helpful Receptionist","body":"After a worrying hospital appointment I was put at ease after speaking to a receptionist.

I generally have nothing but praise for everyone in the medical profession and every kind of care worker in this country and around the world. So, it’s unfortunate to share my particular experience with this practice. I'll start by saying that just thinking about telephoning for an appointment leads to anxiousness as it can take forever to get through. If you don't have 30 minutes or an hour plus to spare waiting in a telephone queue, they advise that appointments can be made online. I've tried that too but honestly, their website is awful to navigate and when I did finally manage to find and successfully submit the correct form to book an appointment, I discovered 10 days later when following up that it hadn't been received. On one occasion I arrived five minutes early for my allotted appointment time, but wasn't seen for an entire hour later. On this occasion when seen, I felt that the GP was rude and disrespectful, as the GP showed very little concern that I had been waiting. I felt that their apology was reluctant and insincere. Also, throughout the appointment, the GP had an unsympathetic bedside manner and I found the appointment awkward. On another occasion, I did manage to get connected on the telephone and speak with someone only to be told to email them. On this occasion my email was answered the same day, however the information I was expecting back didn't arrive, and only after following up nearly two weeks later, I was advised that they had replied by email. On these occasions with sensitive emailed information, most people would 'forward' their previous response showing that they had been sincere and responded in a timely manner, rather than sending a new response. Thus feeling like you’re unimportant and it’s just fobbed-off as an email issue.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2021-09-25T00:23:54","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2021-09-25T18:05:05","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/880945","id":"880945"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/880945/responses","id":"880945"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/880945/healthservices","id":"880945"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/880945/tags","id":"880945"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/e82071","id":"E82071","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/concern","id":"concern"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unimportant","id":"Unimportant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/awkward","id":"awkward"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/connected","id":"connected"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reluctant","id":"reluctant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid","id":"covid"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%2019","id":"covid 19"}]},{"id":880925,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Credits to the NHS","body":"I visited the Emergency Department yesterday/early hours of this morning with a very nasty cut to my knee.

On Saturday 11th September, I rang my pharmacist (Rowlands Festing Buildings) for advice in getting better pain relief whilst I waited for gp surgery to get back to me. He was excellent advised I ring 111. So, I did, waited on the phone queue for at least 30 minutes but needed to stick with it. Then I got connected to a male operator and we went through my problems and that ultimately, I needed better pain relief over weekend whilst GP shut. He made all the notes advised I needed the ooh GP to prescribe stuff and said that GP would ring within 2 hrs. As I put the phone down the GP was instantly on the phone. She listened to my symptoms and prescribed the painkillers and something to help me sleep a bit better, both in line with the suggestions the pharmacist made. She said she'd sent the prescription to Festing Buildings which shuts at 1pm on Saturday and marked it urgent. My husband drove me round there and the pharmacist had it ready. I took my first co-codamol at about 1145. The 111 waiting time seems a bit daunting but I needed some help so I had to hang on. From there the service and support I had was brilliant. It gives me great pleasure so say THANK YOU to the people I interacted with that day. I thought the help I received that day was outstanding.

Knowing how busy A&E is due Covid did not want to attend hospital unless needed to but didnt know what was recommended with having a child being so sick who is so little. The call handler from 111 was brilliant and helped me answer all the questioned needed for the initial assessment. Was told a clinian would phone within 2 hours but did not hear from anyone for over 10 hours! Appreciate this is a crazy time for the NHS but was left worrying if should be taking my child for urgent health care or not and when finally did get a call the nurse I spoke to was hurrying me along as admitted was close to breaching their deadlines. The 111 service clearly needs investment to release other services such as A&E and ambulance services as on weekends people dont have alternatives available. Luckily my child is now ok but having seeing a GP since have been recommended to go to hospital if have a repeat event. I hope this review can be used to highlight the need for investment of the 111 service not to be critial of an already struggling service.
