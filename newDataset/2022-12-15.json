[{"id":1005425,"author":"phasemj58","authorRoleId":4,"authorRole":"a relative","title":"Poor ongoing experience at Airbes Road Centre","body":"My mother has been in the care of Strathclyde Ward now for over three weeks for a critical care assessment. The handover between Wishaw General to Airbles Road Centre regarding her transfer was non-existent, and nearly resulted in my mother being discharged back home without an appropriate care package in place.  \r\nMy experience of the nursing staff at Strathclyde Ward differs wildly from my interactions with the staff at Wishaw General. The staff at Wishaw were all welcoming and very approachable, regardless of how busy the ward was (Ward 9). Not my experience on the Strathclyde Ward.  \r\nThe nursing station on the Strathclyde appears to turn into a staff room at visiting times, with staff congregating around it. Do the staff have nothing to do during visiting hours? It is certainly not approachable and certainly not welcoming. In fact, this set up is very off-putting when family members are looking to discuss the progress of their loved ones.  \r\nThere have also been a number of other smaller issues regarding my mum's care which I raised today with the ward manager, but on reflection I am very disappointed and dissatisfied with the discussion.  \r\nMy mum has fallen twice now whilst she has been on this ward. Luckily, she didn’t injure herself. The other day, I was met with a horrendous smell in the ward when I visited her. The smell was coming from a bowl of rotten melon which I had took in for my mum two days earlier. The bowl of fruit was still sitting on my mum's table, fermenting away, covered in mould. This confirmed what I suspected from the moment she arrived on this ward, a lack of care and attention.  \r\nI feel there is a toxic culture in this unit which needs to be called out. I really want my mum out of this environment as soon as possible, but we await the care package, which could take weeks.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-12-07T17:52:00.68","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-12-15T09:07:03.323","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lanarkshire","count":3}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1005425","id":"1005425"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1005425/responses","id":"1005425"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1005425/healthservices","id":"1005425"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1005425/tags","id":"1005425"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l218h","id":"L218H","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l308h-care-of-the-elderly","id":"L308H-Care-of-the-Elderly","score":0},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disappointed","id":"disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dissatisfied","id":"dissatisfied"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/coordination","id":"coordination"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fall","id":"fall"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/handover","id":"handover"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vascular%20dementia","id":"vascular dementia"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/welcoming","id":"welcoming"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mobility%20issues","id":"mobility issues"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1009656","id":"1009656"}]},{"id":1007182,"author":"SinJin","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Released feeling good again","body":"At work and had an asthma attack.

I had fallen and landed on my back at the start of December. Over the week it had gotten worse. The GP had made arrangements with minor injuries for an x-ray at 6:00pm. At 5:00pm I was contacted and asked to go to A&E who would be expecting me - no reason given.  \r\nI arrived at about 5:15pm and spoke to receptionist who had no idea of me coming spent a few minutes trying to find out why I was there? I explained to the receptionist and the rest of A&E that I had seen the GP etc. So from having an appointment to go and sit down and wait. I waited and waited. After 2 hours I saw triage 1, had my blood pressure taken again and was told to sit and wait. Where I couldn't help but listen to everyone's personal business as to why they were there, confidentially nonexistent.  \r\nWhile waiting I felt very hot and dizzy I knew I was going to faint as I slid of the seat on to the floor and lay there for approximately 20 mins. Not a soul came to help me. Eventually I made it back to my seat.  \r\nDuring my next 2 hour wait I saw triage 2 who banged out their orders and asked me why I was there. I again explained my story. The nurse asked if I had taken meds, I explained only what doctor had given me in the morning 1 tramadol. They asked several times if I was sure. They then left the room and came back with medication handed me a plastic pot and water and a number of pain-killers. I explained I didn't take one of them as it affected my stomach, well don't take them then they said. I was given water and I took the others that were left. Then I was told to sit back in the waiting room.  \r\nI waited till approximately 10:30 when I was called to see doctor who took my story again. They felt my back and said there didn't appear to be to much pain as I had felt him when he examined me. I told him I don't take medication unless necessary for blood pressure. I can't feel anything since I was given PK that make me sick, faint in fact, made me ill. I was told to go home and rest at approximately 11:00pm. After sitting in constant pain and discomfort for 6 hrs to be given a cocktail of drugs and then see a doctor. My symptoms were weakness, fainting and being sick. I was disorientated, confused and was told to go home and exercise and keep moving .  \r\nI realise that staff are busy but these people seem to be desensitised. There was no confidentially. The place is unkempt (people not putting rubbish in bins provides). The chairs are inappropriate for people sitting for hours.

He lives on his own and depends on the support of myself, my daughter and his care package to help maintain some form of normality.Beginning of November 2022 – My brother was found collapsed at home on this date. We called for ambulance on 999 and he was sent to Accident and Emergency (A&E) at University Hospital Wishaw. After being initially assessed in A&E, he was admitted to the Emergency Care Unit (ECU).The next day - He was transferred to Ward 9.  \r\nAt the time, communication was lacking as we only found out that he was transferred after we turned up at ECU to visit him.Two days after being admitted – My daughter was called saying that he was fit for discharge from the hospital. She struggled to get him home using portable oxygenand no offer of patient transport was made. Upon arriving home, he collapsed again for a second time, this time in respiratory arrest. This meant another call to 999 for an ambulance and a return to University Hospital Wishaw A&E. He was subsequently transferred to Ward 8.Mid November 2022 – My brother was still in Ward 8.  \r\nNeither my daughter or myself had received any communication from the ward about the future plans for my brother’s care, despite the fact that we were visiting him daily. Eventually when asked, a staff nurse informed my daughter that he would be discharged in 5 days and they had assumed that the family would be responsible for his ongoing care even though he had an existing care package in place prior to his hospital stay. Given the deterioration of his health and his mobility, we were concerned that his current level of care outside hospital was insufficient.Two days later, late on this evening (approx. 10:30pm), my daughter received a call from Ward 8 informing her that my brother was being transferred to Ward 6. This transfer was apparently because he was expected to be discharged. Days following move to Ward 6– During the night, he was awakened and transferred to Ward 18. As far as my family and brother were concerned there had been no changes to his health to warrant such a move.  \r\nWhen my daughter arrived at Ward 6 to visit him, staff were unaware of who my brother was or where he was. This is appalling that family are not informed of their relative’s whereabouts within this hospital as it appears to be an issue with more than just one ward. Following the move to Ward 18, Doctors there determined that he was actually not fit for discharge. We wonder whether the constant upheaval over the weekend led to this decline.The next day – Suddenly, he was fit for discharge. He arrived home, this time by patient transport. He was home for around 15 minutes when he called me explaining that he was struggling to walk, frightened to fall and became incontinent. He was also sent home with diarrhoea.The next day – He was feeling unwell at home throughout the day. During his evening visit from his carers, he was violently sick despite not having eaten and they called my daughter concerned that he was having a seizure.  \r\nMy daughter asked his carers to call 999 for an ambulance immediately. Myself and my daughter rushed over where we found him covered in sick and then he had a further seizure while waiting on the ambulance. He was rushed in a blue light ambulance back to the hospital. Whilst in A&E, he had a further seizure and was extremely unwell. He spent the rest of the night in A&E and most of the following day whilst they tried find him a bed within the hospital.The next day – He was transferred to ECU in the late afternoon/early evening. I received a call from ECU informing that he was due to be moved to Ward 10, however this afternoon he was too unwell to be moved.Currently, my brother is still in hospital.Over the course of 22 days, he has been in A&E (x3), ECU (x2), Ward 9, Ward 8, Ward 6, Ward 18 and potentially Ward 10.  \r\nWe have grave concerns about the continuity of his care as he was moved so frequently and even greater concerns about the fact that he was discharged only to be brought back in an ambulance within 24 hours.This shameful treatment has contributed to a massive decline in his physical health and mobility. This experience has made the hospital feel like a revolving door and has been extremely unsettling for myself and my daughter.  \r\n  \r\n","criticality":"strongly

On arrival at the Accident and Emergency Department I was seen swiftly and made comfortable in a cubicle. My memory is sketchy, but I was seen by various doctors, consultants, attended the Maxillofacial Department, the West of England Eye Unit and had a CT scan.  \r\nThroughout the day everyone was so compassionate, helpful and reassuring. Although not in the first flush of youth, I am embarrassingly not very brave in a busy environment, let alone in pain in a hospital, and upset at having lost a horse who I had had for 22 years. I am normally the person reassuring others!  \r\nEveryone was so kind, although clearly busy, they checked me frequently and even cheerfully collected the frozen peas I had trailed from the pack I was using on my eye. Someone even managed to find sandwiches and tea for my poor husband, who is in his 80s and was understandably shocked by my predicament.  \r\nI was diagnosed with a tripod fracture to my face, necessitating a repair to my orbital floor at a later date.  \r\nUpon returning to the hospital two weeks later to undergo the orbital repair surgery, I was again treated very compassionately. As I nervously waited in the admissions ward, embarrassingly my legs wouldn't stop shaking, but everyone was again kind and understanding, and the anaesthetist came to administer something to ease my nerves. The anaethetists who looked after me were again so cheerful and understanding, chatting away to me and keeping me cheerful until I fell asleep. Upon waking in the recovery ward, the nurse who looked after me was again so kind.  \r\nI spent the night on a ward as my eye needed hourly checks and I also required intravenous antibiotics to be administered during the night.  \r\nI was discharged the following day and have had several follow-up consultations just to check on my recovery.  \r\nMy treatment and recovery have been nothing short of remarkable. Prior to surgery my eye had sunk, which upset those who saw me, and I suffered with severe double vision. Following surgery, I am now able to live my life normally and my eye now looks as it did before the accident. I am so eternally grateful for everything which was done for me and can never repay that debt.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-12-14T09:27:15.97","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-12-15T10:27:06.453","readBy":[{"name":"Royal Devon University Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1007851","id":"1007851"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1007851/responses","id":"1007851"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1007851/healthservices","id":"1007851"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1007851/tags","id":"1007851"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rh801_130","id":"RH801_130","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rh801_144","id":"RH801_144","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rh801_180","id":"RH801_180","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/accident","id":"accident"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/antibiotics","id":"antibiotics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ct%20scan","id":"CT scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency","id":"emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/eye","id":"eye"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/face","id":"face"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fracture","id":"fracture"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helpful","id":"helpful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kindness","id":"kindness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/level%20of%20care","id":"level of care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scan","id":"scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/severe%20pain","id":"severe pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/understanding","id":"understanding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vision","id":"vision"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/well%20cared%20for","id":"well cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cheerful","id":"cheerful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassionate","id":"compassionate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20ease","id":"at ease"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/comfortable","id":"comfortable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nothing%20too%20much%20trouble","id":"nothing too much trouble"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1008766","id":"1008766"}]},{"id":1007852,"author":"runningpc45","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"The best care I could ever have hoped for","body":"Had an operation at New Cross Wolverhampton.

Despite my appointment being purely to discuss any necessary treatment for my cervical erosion, Dr Inyang gave me the opportunity to really share how I was feeling. For the first time, I felt like I no longer needed to suffer in silence. I had options, and something could be done to help me.  \r\nFast forward a year, and I was given a hysterectomy which was nothing short of life changing. I had a quick recovery, and felt the fittest I had in longer than I can remember. However five months later, and I had been experiencing pain, bleeding and general discomfort. This was naturally a worrying time for me, and following a GP consultation, I was referred back to Gynaecology for further investigations.  \r\nI received an ultrasound scan of the abdomen within two weeks of my initial referral which was wonderful. However the most outstanding part of my care has to be attributed to my gynaecologist, Dr Inyang, who has gone above and beyond from the outset.  \r\nI was naturally terrified something was really wrong, to be experiencing this sort of pain and bleeding again. Dr Inyang understood my concern, and rather than having me wait for my results, he called me the following evening, to give me the outcome - which, I am delighted to say, was positive.  \r\nThe main reason for preparing this statement is to acknowledge Dr Inyang. He is approachable. He is professional. He is caring and compassionate. He saw me as an individual - not a number. Not 'just another patient'.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-12-14T13:17:40.7533333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-12-15T10:57:49.61","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Ayrshire & Arran","count":8},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2022)","count":1},{"name":"Scottish Government","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1007954","id":"1007954"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1007954/responses","id":"1007954"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1007954/healthservices","id":"1007954"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1007954/tags","id":"1007954"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/a111h_502","id":"A111H_502","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/terrified","id":"terrified"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/above%20and%20beyond","id":"above and beyond"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/approachable","id":"approachable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bleeding","id":"bleeding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/caring","id":"caring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/concerned","id":"concerned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/consultant","id":"consultant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/endometriosis","id":"endometriosis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fitter","id":"fitter"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gynaecology","id":"gynaecology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hysterectomy","id":"hysterectomy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/life%20changing","id":"life changing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/person-centred","id":"person-centred"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professional","id":"professional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/quick%20response","id":"quick response"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ultrasound%20scan","id":"Ultrasound scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassionate","id":"compassionate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20options","id":"given options"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20time","id":"given time"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1008405","id":"1008405"}]},{"id":1007960,"author":"Emmgh49","authorRoleId":8,"authorRole":"a staff member posting for a patient/service user","title":"Most of the staff on the ward have been very good","body":"I have been on this ward for 4 ½ weeks.

Having visited the practice a few times now, I have been met with nothing but a warm welcome and fantastic rapport.  \r\nI’d like to especially pass on my thanks for a recent story. I have just moved my ADHD prescription from my private psychiatrist to my NHS GP. The medication under the Shared Care agreement for ADHD is paramount to my daily functioning. Unfortunately my private psychiatrist had delayed in passing the info over and I was on the last day of my medication. I called the practice in a complete panic and rest assured, Corrin was able to work her magic. I had my medication within 18 hours (not even 24)! Honestly it may seem hyperbolic but the impact that these gestures of going out of your way to make someone’s life significantly easier are life saving. Even the reassurance from Corrin over the phone alone was enough to bring my sky-rocketing anxiety down to 0. The couple of minutes of conversation can be the difference between a good and a bad day for me, so the impact of this goodwill is a godsend!  \r\nThe relief and safety of having such a helpful team does not go unappreciated. In fact, many a time it has been the reason I have been able to function or not have a bad mental health episode - with medication!  \r\nThis is not the first time the team have supported me - it has been a consistent effort and unmatched level of support I am yet to see elsewhere. Even with the pressures GPs are under, I have never failed to be seen or to have gotten my medication in time even where I have delayed ordering thanks to the quick action by the team.  \r\nProfessionals such as Corrin renew the glimmer of hope in a field which has constantly faced an uphill battle. I am certain that Corrin doesn’t think twice before going the extra mile as it is second nature to her to obtain outcomes for patients. But I would at the very least like to convey that the impact on me as the the recipient has been invaluable.  \r\nI am indebted to the support, care and kindness with which I have been treated with. Human compassion goes a long way - particularly with those such as myself who have battled with their mental health.  \r\nThank you so much to Corrin and the team for somehow managing to keep everything afloat. Community is so important at times like this and I hope my gratitude is passed on.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-12-13T17:10:00.0233333","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2022-12-15T11:22:55.543","readBy":[{"name":"The Neaman Practice","count":2},{"name":"City & Hackney GP Confederation","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1007661","id":"1007661"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1007661/responses","id":"1007661"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1007661/healthservices","id":"1007661"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1007661/tags","id":"1007661"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/f84640","id":"F84640","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/adhd","id":"adhd"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/community","id":"community"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/consideration","id":"consideration"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helpful","id":"helpful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/less%20anxious","id":"less anxious"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/looked%20after","id":"looked after"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/person-centred","id":"person-centred"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/quick%20response","id":"quick response"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/rapport","id":"rapport"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/responsive","id":"responsive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/results","id":"results"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/welcoming","id":"welcoming"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassion","id":"compassion"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/relieved","id":"relieved"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported","id":"supported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/going%20the%20extra%20mile","id":"going the extra mile"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/warmth%20&%20kindness","id":"warmth & kindness"}]},{"id":1007978,"author":"Dr.Mariam","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Good labour experience","body":"I delivered my daughter in Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow.  \r\nSix years ago, I had my son in the same hospital and had a horrible midwife that made my experience very traumatic, and I was dreading this the whole time in my 2nd pregnancy.  \r\nThis time my midwife was Nelly.

I took some months out of work, but eventually realised I need to have a routine and work is important to me.  \r\nI tried to find employment for myself but failed as I could not sort out simple things like filling in an application form, arranging interviews etc, such was the degree to which I had suffered burnout. I registered for employment support through Dr Pathy at Millbrook Mental Health Unit, where I am an outpatient.  \r\nBeing able to meet regularly with Jordan (and previously Younis) made a world of difference, as their support to make sense of application processes and to help filling in a CV and application forms was vital in getting me back into being able to think about work. Having someone to talk to honestly about how I feel towards work helped to clarify what kind of employment is available to me and having a person who listens to how I feel about making applications etc means that I can address any issues that would have meant failure previously.  \r\nThe ordered and organised approach Jordan has taken has clarified things brilliantly and having her attend work interviews and be there to support me in communicating with employers has been vital in stopping me just giving up when things seemed overwhelming.  \r\nI now have a part-time job to go to and working through a plan to survive at work and looking at what ongoing support I may need to succeed is invaluable for me as otherwise I will fail again as soon as there is an issue I can’t cope with.  \r\nWithout Jordan’s support and the resources she brings to me I have no doubt that I would not have continued to seek employment and there would have been a continued deterioration in my mental health.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-12-14T15:33:48.7233333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-12-15T11:52:46.267","readBy":[{"name":"Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust","count":9}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1008027","id":"1008027"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1008027/responses","id":"1008027"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1008027/healthservices","id":"1008027"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1008027/tags","id":"1008027"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rha-ips-futures-positive","id":"rha-ips-futures-positive","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/listening","id":"listening"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/personality%20disorder","id":"personality disorder"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/resources","id":"resources"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported","id":"supported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/employment%20support","id":"employment support"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1009450","id":"1009450"}]},{"id":1008049,"author":"likeablegk66","authorRoleId":3,"authorRole":"a parent/guardian","title":"Пошук прихистку в Північній Ірландії Seeking refuge in Northern Ireland","body":"Я з трьома дітьми приїхали на навчання до Північної Ірландії.

The nurse said hello to her and then basically left – they didn’t do anything. My partner died a couple of days later.  \r\nWhen I called the doctor to verify death, they said they didn’t know it had become this bad, they had been on holiday but was surprised no one had informed them on their return.  \r\nI would have thought the district nurses had a duty to inform the patient’s doctor.  \r\nThis nurse really upset me, and I felt they gave no care to my partner or myself during this traumatic time. I had been caring for my partner for 2 and half years while she battled cancer.  \r\nAs I said, the other nurses were brilliant, and I couldn’t fault them, and Weldmar were brilliant can’t praise them enough.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-12-09T12:30:36.6733333","progress":"Made change","dateOfPublication":"2022-12-15T15:20:04.933","readBy":[{"name":"Weldmar Hospicecare Trust","count":1},{"name":"Dorset Healthcare University NHS Foundation Trust - End of Life - Palliative Care","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1006412","id":"1006412"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1006412/responses","id":"1006412"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1006412/healthservices","id":"1006412"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1006412/tags","id":"1006412"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/1-101728519","id":"1-101728519","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rdy-peolc","id":"RDY-peolc","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cancer","id":"cancer"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/considerate","id":"considerate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/death","id":"death"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hospice","id":"hospice"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mixed%20feelings","id":"mixed feelings"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/most%20staff","id":"Most staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20communication","id":"staff communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/one%20district%20nurse","id":"one district nurse"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/most%20care","id":"most care"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1008456","id":"1008456"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1008470","id":"1008470"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1026662","id":"1026662"}]},{"id":1008076,"author":"Grateful#7","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Excellent care","body":"Excellent care received with dignity, warmth and respect from Dr Panigrahy and gynaecology clinic team staff nurse Tina and care assistant Pamela.

From walking into the delivery suite to leaving it, my husband and I were treated with respect and compassion. All the staff we encountered were so friendly and encouraging. My Midwife for the day shift was Louise, who immediately put me at ease from the moment we started walking down the corridor! I was anxious as this was my first baby. She provided us with information so we could make informed decisions and went through our birth preferences. We were able to have lots of laughs and chat. My labour progressed past her shift end, so Catherine and Jenny helped me in the final stages of labour. I needed a ventouse delivery in the end, and this was explained to me clearly and our son was born safely that night. Afterwards, Catherine and Jenny continued to look after us as a family, giving us valuable skin to skin during our golden hour and assisted me in my son's first breastfeed.
