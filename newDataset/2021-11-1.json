I spoke to a private GP first, who advised me to go to A&E, but as I felt too unwell for the journey I decided to phone 111 to see if I absolutely had to or not.  \r\nIt was arranged for a paramedic clinician to call me back, and this brilliant lady was on the phone to me for 40 minutes, checking all my symptoms etc. I was extremely reluctant to go to A&E as my local hospital has no understanding of my health condition, and they always throw me out at the soonest opportunity, but this kind paramedic was insistent that my reaction was a very rare occurrence that did need urgent care. She also said I should go straight to A&E, so my husband took me, & we spent the night there. As I needed to be in a wheelchair, they did at least let him in too.  \r\nI had various tests, & then saw an A&E doctor. She asked why we were there, and asked what long covid is, she told me I wasn't having a bad reaction to the vaccine, it must be something else. I wish the lovely paramedic I'd spoken to at home had been there at that moment, she would have been furious with that doctor. The same old story - no one wants to take any responsibility for anything. She said my dizziness was likely to be because of drinking alcohol - I don't drink alcohol as I can't tolerate it, but she appeared totally convinced that's what the problem was. There was absolutely no attempt to do anything to try and relieve any symptoms - I do not understand how this hospital operates safely. I asked for morphine as my pain levels were very high, but she wouldn't give me any (even to get home on) because morphine isn't for dizziness. I said I needed it for the pain, but she said I hadn't presented with pain - I said that actually I had, so please could she give me some, but she was completely unmoved.  \r\nThere was absolutely no way I could communicate with the 'robots' at this hospital's A&E department, they barely acted human, without trying to sound rude. I am yet again just a number, and I got no help whatsoever, in fact it made all my symptoms worse - as per the norm. It always seems to be my fault that I'm there. Last time I went there I vowed never to go back - now I know why I made that vow. How can the place be safe? I found it in no way fit for purpose. How can you run an A&E department with doctors who demonstrated to me so little medical knowledge? It is beyond me to even begin to understand it, and it is pretty frightening. If that's all the care every patient gets then I am appalled beyond words.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-10-28T16:14:52.83","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-11-01T09:20:03.147","readBy":[{"name":"South East Coast Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust","count":1},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2021)","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/890915","id":"890915"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/890915/responses","id":"890915"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/890915/healthservices","id":"890915"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/890915/tags","id":"890915"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rvv01_180","id":"RVV01_180","score":1},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/ryd-nhs111","id":"RYD-nhs111","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/access%20to%20pain%20relief","id":"access to pain relief"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/alcohol","id":"alcohol"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blackout","id":"blackout"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bloods","id":"bloods"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diagnosis","id":"diagnosis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dizziness","id":"dizziness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ecg","id":"ecg"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/expertise","id":"expertise"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/head%20pain","id":"head pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kindness","id":"kindness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lovely","id":"lovely"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mistreated","id":"mistreated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/morphine","id":"morphine"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/most%20doctors","id":"most doctors"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nhs111","id":"NHS111"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/paramedic","id":"paramedic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/read%20notes%20properly","id":"Read notes properly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/severe%20pain","id":"severe pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tests","id":"tests"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wheelchair","id":"wheelchair"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/a&e%20care","id":"A&E care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/untreated","id":"untreated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/in%20danger","id":"in danger"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/just%20a%20number","id":"just a number"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/worse%20off","id":"worse off"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/worse%20than%20before","id":"worse than before"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dangerous","id":"dangerous"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid","id":"covid"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/listened%20to","id":"listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%2019","id":"covid 19"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/worse%20for%20trying","id":"worse for trying"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doing%20job%20properly","id":"doing job properly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vaccine%20reaction","id":"vaccine reaction"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/891949","id":"891949"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/892049","id":"892049"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/892741","id":"892741"}]},{"id":890996,"author":"funnyfc88","authorRoleId":3,"authorRole":"a parent/guardian","title":"Tongue tie in Glasgow.","body":"I have just read a post on here from a grandmother who's grandchild was not offered a frenotomy despite a tongue tie as he was not breastfed.

Whilst I acknowledge that these are challenging times, patient capacity has increased and phone lines are often busy, it is also one of the best GP practices that I have been registered with. \nHaving spoken to patient advisors, I cannot believe the amount of abuse, intolerant and aggressive behaviour that staff have to tolerate on a daily basis. I wouldn't want that job. Anyone who works within a specialised unit, would understand that each group of people have their roles, so to say that people are chatting away while others struggle to answer the phones and receive patients is ridiculous. We appear to live in a blame society, where it is easy to put our frustrations onto others, because we want what we want, now and nothing else matters. I think it's easy to expect more of others than we offer ourselves. For example, if I had a problem I would initially see my local pharmacist and sort it out myself if I can. My GP, is my last resort and I wouldn't want to take away someone's serious problems by taking up patient advisors time and the phone lines, unless there was a serious issue. And, I can safely say, that under no circumstances, would I treat people who are only doing their job, with such disdain and contempt.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2021-10-31T22:32:09","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-11-01T11:20:17","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/891968","id":"891968"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/891968/responses","id":"891968"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/891968/healthservices","id":"891968"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/891968/tags","id":"891968"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/k84624","id":"K84624","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/shocked","id":"shocked"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/abuse","id":"abuse"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/group","id":"group"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/892606","id":"892606"}]},{"id":891972,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Really bad practice ","body":"Can never get an appointment, phoned Tulasi 3 medical practices at 0800hrs, 2 of them at 0801hrs said on their recorded message, 'Appointments are all fully booked' the other said to 'Call back as all lines are busy'!!

I was very nervous, a couple of years ago I had been through a similar process but didn't require any follow ups after the biopsy as they weren't concerned. I was met by a nurse who made me feel completely at ease. She introduced me to the Gynaecology Consultant Mr Mohanty who explained the procedure in full and gave me confidence in him and his team. The procedure went smoothly, I was quite tearful and anxious but the nurse and healthcare support worker were amazing, they kept me calm and distracted me while the procedure was carried out.It is never nice being on the other side of your job, but I feel my experience was made so much better by the staff involved, and they're all a credit to the NHS.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-10-29T19:12:09.3166667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-11-01T13:00:44.663","readBy":[{"name":"United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust","count":4}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/891646","id":"891646"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/891646/responses","id":"891646"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/891646/healthservices","id":"891646"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/891646/tags","id":"891646"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rwdla_502","id":"RWDLA_502","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/biopsy","id":"biopsy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/calming","id":"calming"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/colposcopy","id":"colposcopy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gynaecology","id":"gynaecology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/individual","id":"Individual"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professional","id":"professional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20ease","id":"at ease"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/listened%20to","id":"listened to"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/893078","id":"893078"}]},{"id":891613,"author":"junegt96","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"No communication with staff members","body":"I came to ED due to chest pain that appeared to worsen throughout the day.

I was reassured by a member of the sexual health team that in the ward, I would have access to strong pain relief if required.  \r\nI arrived at the ward and was shown to my room. The nurse then came into my room, gave me my name band and explained the procedure briefly. I’m not sure if they introduced themself to me as I can’t remember a name. I voiced my anxiety around the pain and my previous experience but was met with no support or reassurance. I found the nurse to be extremely rough when inserting the tablets for the termination. I was tense due to the fear of the unknown but they just kept telling me to relax, I apologised and said I have had a bad experience before that’s why I am tense but this was not acknowledged. All I needed was a few minutes to calm down but it seemed that the staff member did not have time for that or for me. Needless to say I was considerably upset and in significant pain following this. They left a painkiller and an anti sickness tablet on the bedside and left. Unfortunately, I was reduced to tears at this point. As the painkillers were not administered prior to the termination medication, I gained no benefit from them at all. When I buzzed for pain relief I was asked by the same nurse if my periods were normally this bad. I was in agony and felt like I was being questioned for this. After a few hours of pain with little relief from pain killers, I eventually managed to shut my eyes. I was exhausted. The nurse then came to tell me that I was being moved to the scanning room where I could sit and await discharge because they had lots of emergencies that day. I was still in a lot of pain and feeling sick. I packed up my things and a lovely student nurse helped me walk round to the room - there was a hard upright chair to sit on. I was not shown where a toilet was even though I was still heavily bleeding. By this stage I just wanted home to see my husband for support. Again, the student nurse made me a slice of toast whilst i waited. The original nurse from earlier came to see me, told me I had my discharge letter and I could go. I was given no advice on what is normal following a medical abortion and when and whom I should contact if I was concerned.  \r\nI walked from the ward to my car in tears and in pain. I’m aware that compared to the other patients on the ward, I was not ‘acutely unwell’ and I am also aware that wards can be busy. However, I had a right to receive patient-centered compassionate care and unfortunately, I never received that. I felt rushed and to move me to a room with a hard chair and no toilet access when I was still in lots of pain was not good enough. As a nurse myself, I am aware that there can be barriers within nursing practice however being compassionate and taking the time to listen to your patients is fundamental practice within nursing. Unfortunately, on reflecting on my experience I wished I had stayed at home as it has made what was already a very traumatic and sensitive procedure even more upsetting for me.  \r\nI wanted to give feedback as a health professional as I feel it’s important that staff can reflect on practice for the future and change it, so that no one else shares the same experience as I did.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-10-29T17:30:08.58","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-11-01T14:56:11.533","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Grampian","count":5},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2022)","count":1},{"name":"Aberdeen City Health & Social Care Partnership","count":1},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2021)","count":3},{"name":"Sheffield University Medical School 2021","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/891576","id":"891576"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/891576/responses","id":"891576"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/891576/healthservices","id":"891576"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/891576/tags","id":"891576"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/n101h_502","id":"N101H_502","score":2},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/should%20listen","id":"Should listen"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/abortion","id":"abortion"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/advice","id":"advice"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/discharge%20information","id":"discharge information"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/distressed","id":"distressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ectopic%20pregnancy","id":"ectopic pregnancy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/in%20pain","id":"in pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain%20relief","id":"pain relief"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/patient-centred","id":"patient-centred"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassurance","id":"reassurance"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/rushed","id":"rushed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/termination","id":"termination"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/traumatised","id":"traumatised"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassion","id":"compassion"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attitudes","id":"staff attitudes"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tense","id":"tense"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/892330","id":"892330"}]},{"id":891642,"author":"guidetx88","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"The new callback system is a farce","body":"I called my GP several times and waited hour’s in-between for a call back which never happened.

This leaves the day area and other areas sometimes locked off, and we also don’t get fresh air as we should because of staffing.  We bring this up in meetings and get told by matrons and deputy matrons it will get sorted, then the next day they again take staff off us.  This is the last straw I can go down to be listened too and hoping some one listens.  I don’t feel safe some days.  Our activity coordinator for the ward gets taken into nursing numbers or moved to another ward so we don’t get our activities.  We get medication late, lunch and dinner late so its barely warm.

When you phone them, it also says to use the econsult system so I chose the extension for general enquiries as there are no better options. I was on hold for over 20 minutes and was told that I should have completed an econsult between 7-9 am. It doesn't say you have to do it at any specific time on the website so I woke up and tried literally just after 9 but had already missed the opportunity to get an appointment till i do an econsult at 7am tomorrow. This would be more manageable if I wasn't really, really ill while trying to sort this out. The receptionist was very nice and gave me useful advice but this doesn't change the fact that It is much too difficult to make an appointment. I will now have to go to a walk in centre as I need to be seen by a doctor today.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2021-11-01T09:55:06","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-11-01T20:37:04","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Leeds ICB","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/892103","id":"892103"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/892103/responses","id":"892103"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/892103/healthservices","id":"892103"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/892103/tags","id":"892103"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/b86110","id":"B86110","score":null},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/905173","id":"905173"}]},{"id":892109,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Very efficient ","body":"I called, on speck, at the Council Offices, Loughborough to see if I could possibly received my 3rd/booster COVID Injection.
