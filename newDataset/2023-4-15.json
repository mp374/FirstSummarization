Only econsultations, to which they reply telling you you will be contacted many days later, they don't give you a time of the day when Dr will call you. They only call you once and don't try again.  Since covid the service in this surgery has gone down hill. I was very ill recently had to put about 3 econsultations did not get a call only a cough syrup and nasal spray sent to the chemist over 3 weeks after the problem started. I had to put another e consultation like begging for Dr to call me.  Today the Dr called to discuss blood tests and unfortunately I press the wrong key and cut him off, I called the receptionist and explained, she said she will put a note for the Dr to call again. Nobody call.\nMy son had an accident and asked for x-ray form to check if rib broken, was given a f2f app for next week 3 weeks after the initial incident. The advice was if he could not wait go to a and E. If u have a suspected urine infection u still have to do an econsultation and wait for them to contact you to tell u to bring a sample.\nI work in a surgery and there patients can make on the day apps for emergencies, or prebookable for the week or 2 ahead. In case of uti patients dropped urine and is dipped by the nurse. We don't get inundated with urine samples, as the receptionist at bellgrove surgery claimed is the case. On a bad day max 5 urine samples.\nI have been with this surgery for 25 years, but lately the service is pitiful you are made to feel as if Drs are doing you a favour. \nThe system should be improved to give pts options of booking apps on the phone and to consider that pts work and can't take a call any time and to call the pt twice if pt did not answer. It is the case in other surgeries not only where I work.\nI know you probably think that if I am not happy I should find another surgery, that's not the solution.\nI am extremely dissatisfied at the inflexible changes the surgery have made.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2023-04-14T17:53:00","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-04-15T19:15:04","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1054604","id":"1054604"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1054604/responses","id":"1054604"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1054604/healthservices","id":"1054604"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1054604/tags","id":"1054604"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/g83009","id":"G83009","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dissatisfied","id":"dissatisfied"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood","id":"blood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20tests","id":"blood tests"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/broken","id":"broken"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cough","id":"cough"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/infection","id":"infection"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nasal","id":"nasal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tests","id":"tests"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/uti","id":"uti"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/x-ray","id":"X-ray"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happy","id":"happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/in%20the%20way","id":"in the way"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid","id":"covid"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20happy","id":"not happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20happy","id":"very happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%2019","id":"covid 19"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/like%20myself","id":"like myself"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20ill","id":"very ill"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1062679","id":"1062679"}]},{"id":1054603,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Appointment ","body":"Terrible medical centre.

Firstly my mental health was a shambles, which I think was quiet visible. This was their first priority! Secondly every single member of the team were compassionate. I have never experienced this in one place before. Thirdly, during my procedure you could see I was very anxious before the general anaesthesia, the Surgeon and the Anaesthetists wasted no time, introduced themselves to me while getting me prepared. They kept me in conversation, reassured me and the Anaesthetists should be a stand up comedian, he was fantastic. Lastly once taken into the official room I was lying down with people around me feeling so scared and out of nowhere another midwife comes to hold my hand and then I was out like a light with the anaesthetic. Once I was awake I was taken complete care of. This was one of the hardest decisions I have ever had to make but the staff made it so much easier for me.

When collecting I found out that I was short by 2 medications. Called the practice and with option 5 I was put on hold and I was number 2 in queue and probably after 25 minutes I was number 1. I kept on hold for another 10 minutes when I realised that it is better I walk down to the clinic instead. After almost 40 minutes of holding on line I was disconnected. I went to the reception and enquired about my missing prescription which after some time was told by another young girl at the back office that they had missed them as it was done by some trainee. A very lame excuse from a professional who is in charge of medications for the patients. If a trainee is handling the prescriptions than is not she/he supervised? Anyway then I was told that a new prescription will be forwarded in the evening and I will get my missing medication on the following day which is a Saturday. But as a rule the prescriptions take at least 48 hours at the pharmacy to process so that makes it to following week before I get my medications. I was given an apology which I have to be satisfied with but how can I accept that when this was not the first time it has happened at this surgery. Moreover about my phone call I was told that phones are not manned during afternoon time so your staff think that we as patients are stupid who call on an open line and wait for 45 minutes without being attended to because the phone line is not manned. What is wrong with you people who act as the most unprofessional manner in the most responsible place??? I would definitely love you guys get treated in the same way as us. We are warned by your office that you will not tolerate abusive behaviour but if your staff come up aggressive behaviour and is right on your face than that is acceptable by you. I have been with this surgery for the last 23 years (Carlisle House before) but the standards are just going down and am very disappointed at this latter stage of my life when I am more dependent on the Surgery. Need to do some improvement at the office area now as I am not the only one who is complaining about the services given by you front desk staff.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2023-04-15T09:48:18","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-04-15T19:22:25","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1054611","id":"1054611"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1054611/responses","id":"1054611"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1054611/healthservices","id":"1054611"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1054611/tags","id":"1054611"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/j81052","id":"J81052","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disappointed","id":"disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/better","id":"better"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dependent","id":"dependent"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/face","id":"face"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pharmacy","id":"Pharmacy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20satisfied","id":"very satisfied"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/satisfied","id":"satisfied"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20disappointed","id":"very disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/in%20the%20way","id":"in the way"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disconnected","id":"disconnected"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1056153","id":"1056153"}]},{"id":1054614,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Awful ","body":"Waited four weeks for a telephone appt where it was clearly obvious a face to face was required, as expected then had to go in, no idea why they can’t use some common sense around deciding whether an appt should be in person or not - very inefficient and takes no account of the impacts to the  patient.

She explained about asthma very clearly to my 11 year old son, using simple age appropriate descriptions on how asthma affects the lungs, and how the different inhalers work to relieve or prevent symptoms. She assessed his lungs with a peak flow and asked relevant questions about his asthma symptoms direct to my son, whilst referring back to me when necessary. My son’s prescription was altered plus a more compact spacer was prescribed, making it easier for him to transport to school if necessary. The nurse was very professional, friendly and approachable and as we left the surgery, my son commented on how ‘nice and kind’ she was. All the staff at The Hollies Medical Centre are amazing and work incredibly hard. Thank you all so much for everything that you do for us all.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2023-04-15T20:29:14","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2023-04-16T12:35:07","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1054800","id":"1054800"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1054800/responses","id":"1054800"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1054800/healthservices","id":"1054800"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1054800/tags","id":"1054800"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/c88052","id":"C88052","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/asthma","id":"asthma"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lungs","id":"lungs"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/peak%20flow","id":"peak flow"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"}]},{"id":1054799,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Not good communication","body":"I had a cholesterol test.
