They do not like us to write comments that mention doctors by name, but you are very pretty.  You will make a wonderful senior consultant one day, and hopefully in Peterborough, my granddaughter may need you. Thank you for all you and alk your colleagues do to. I should also add, I was also a patient whilst my father was taken in earlier in the year, but I recovered quickly, so can also comment personally on the excellent care provided.

The review felt very broad and open, we both laughed several times on the call, and by the end I realised I had spoken candidly about my mood, diet, exercise and with it felt comfortable to give true alcohol, blood pressure, weight and   exercise stats. \n\nInstead of the usual disapproving speech about my lifestyle, I found that he really listened to my situation and gave me realistic goals for someone of my weight, confidence and social anxiety – he called me out on my list of excuses too. I haven’t had CBT in over a year, and it felt like I had one of those one on one breakthrough sessions. An actual worthwhile med review with the pharmacist.

I was, as can be expected, very worried about the procedure and indeed delayed it once.  \r\nThe communication from the Hospital was great - reassuring me over the telephone that all would be well. I hate being late so arrived 1/2 hr early - was greeted by a fantastic lady at the colonoscopy department - who was kind, reassuring and actually made me laugh as she was also trying to juggle rotas whilst managing patients.  \r\nI was then greeted by a fantastic pre-procedure nurse - Zoe - who took me through the paperwork and gave me the gown and \"shorts of dignity\". She was so kind, reassuring and could not have put my mind at rest any more if she tried.  \r\nA brief wait and through to the room where I was greeted by the consultant Maia and her wonderful team - and great 80's music playing. Again great care shown for my obvious anxiety - and even held my hand whilst part of the procedure got very uncomfortable.  \r\nPost procedure - very reassuring from Maia and the other 2 lovely nurses (forgive me I cannot record their names - sorry - Anna?).  \r\nOn to recovery and Zoe was there again - great care - a cup of juice and a lovely chat. Not felt hurried in any way - just pure care. Zoe then called my wife, made me a coffee and walked me down to my wife at the car park.  \r\nI was absolutely dreading today - but the whole team - from Booking Office, Reception and all the fantastic clinical staff cannot be praised enough. I am so grateful that today is behind me - but made so much more comfortable by a wonderful team.  \r\nThank you - you all deserve a 100% pay rise.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-03-19T19:58:16.6633333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-03-20T09:47:08.843","readBy":[{"name":"Royal Cornwall Hospitals NHS Trust","count":6}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/833566","id":"833566"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/833566/responses","id":"833566"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/833566/healthservices","id":"833566"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/833566/tags","id":"833566"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/ref12_100","id":"REF12_100","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/worried","id":"worried"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bowel","id":"bowel"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bowel%20cancer","id":"bowel cancer"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/colonoscopy","id":"colonoscopy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/uncomfortable","id":"uncomfortable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dignity","id":"Dignity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fantastic","id":"fantastic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassuring","id":"reassuring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wonderful","id":"wonderful"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/833767","id":"833767"}]},{"id":833504,"author":"rkjacks","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"My 1st Covid vaccine","body":"It was a very professional and happy experience, everyone was so kind reassuring.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-03-19T18:23:40.1433333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-03-20T09:49:03.213","readBy":[{"name":"City & Hackney GP Confederation","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/833504","id":"833504"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/833504/responses","id":"833504"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/833504/healthservices","id":"833504"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/833504/tags","id":"833504"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/q71-chconfed-covid19vaccine","id":"q71-chconfed-covid19vaccine","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kind%20staff","id":"kind staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professional","id":"professional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happy","id":"happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassuring","id":"reassuring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%20vaccine","id":"covid vaccine"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/833759","id":"833759"}]},{"id":833420,"author":"Kelly Larmour","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Flawless COVID vaccination 1 & 2","body":"Received both COVID Vaccines at the Royal Victoria Hospital with the Belfast Health & Social Care Trust, Northern Ireland.  \r\nThe care I received was high quality and person-centred.
