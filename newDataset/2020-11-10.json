The hospital felt very COVID safe. \nI had an initial examination by a specialist, followed by a mammogram & ultrasound & a further meeting with the specialist. At all times the breast care team put me at my ease & took time to explain what they were doing. Whilst the specialist felt everything was ok. It was necessary in my case to obtain a previous mammogram for comparison. This was from a private hospital I had used a few years ago. This had to be requested & therefore could not be obtained that day. The next working day I received a call to let me know that the mammograms compared & fortunately everything was ok.

Services have included MRI under radiology at Ulster Hospital, EEG evaluation at City Hospital Paediatric outpatients at Ulster and Specialist Epilepsy Nurse Service in SEHSCT. Very impressed with all the staff we have encountered who have been empathetic, knowledgeable and professional and have continued to monitor despite COVID restrictions. Our only frustration resulted from how the different hospitals communicate in that the paper referral from one trust to another went missing in postal systems delaying diagnosis. I can't believe in this day and age that services need to rely on unreliable methods such as putting a piece of paper in the post when so many technology solutions are available which are much more efficient and reliable for transfer of information and making referrals. Knowing the benefits of the epilepsy specialist nurse I feel it would also be a real benefit to see them at the same clinic as the paediatrician at the point of diagnosis- we had many many questions but were very conscious of the numbers in the waiting room waiting to see the paediatrician. Access to the specialist nurse in addition would have given us more time with a professional to seek information and reassurance at a very stressful time.

Because my issue isn't urgent, I opted for telephone and within 3 days. I received a response within 10minutes and had a telephone appointment booked within 3 working days. This suited me.\nI had my telephone appointment this morning with an Advanced Nurse Practitioner. She contacted me at the exact time of my appointment and was polite, friendly and listened to everything I had to say. She didn't rush me and talked me through all of my treatment options. She already knew what my issue was as she had read my notes beforehand but still gave me the opportunity to discuss it. She informed me that I needed some blood tests and advised that I would be contacted to book an appointment to have these done. Sure enough, within 10 minutes of putting the phone down, the receptionist contacted me to have a face to face appointment for blood tests. \nI would just like to say a big thank you to EHFP for their excellent service during such a difficult time. \nI would recommend using the AccuRx service to others. Its easy to use, convenient and the practice respond in a timely manner. It definitely beats hanging around on the telephone.\nWell done EHFP for a great service.

Considering I'm a man, they did a wonderful job of easing my nerves and silly thoughts of embarrassment. (its a man thing) My procedure took a while, but the whole time the team were great explaining what was happening and what I needed to do, all delivered with highest levels of courtesy and professionalism, again a smile and a very caring attitude. Procedure completed, explanation on what would happen next, offered a shower, then off to get changed.

His GP prescribed an antidepressant and told us that they would like to refer him to CAMHS but couldn’t because he was too close to being 18 when the adult service would take over. Suggested some NHS counselling services but when contacted they replied that they were unable to offer him anything until he was 18. He deteriorated further and 2 weeks later had a serious suicide attempt, ending up in hospital. He was told he would see a DPN from CAMHS prior to Discharge. He waited 6 hours for someone to come who told us that they were actually not a proper member of the crisis team. We asked about his ongoing antidepressant medication and were told that it would be discussed at the crisis team MDT the following day and his GP would be contacted. He was made a follow up appointment with the crisis team 10 days later.  \r\nThe outcome of the MDT was not communicated promptly to his GP who had to chase it up and in fact was advised not to give any further medication - however, fortunately our GP started another drug anyway. The follow up appointment was with a ‘practioner’ and health care assistant who offered no suggestions for treatment and was a total waste of time. They again told us to contact the counselling services who had already turned him down. Our GP received no communication from them and tried to speak to a consultant, but this was unhelpful.  \r\nHe has remained very ill and has had absolutely no treatment offered by CAMHS for 8 weeks. My husband and I both work within the NHS and in both of our services there is proper provision for 17 year olds to transition across to adult services. The CAMHS service needs to improve this quickly before more young people in their moment of need are failed. We have the resources to take matters into our own hands and have arranged a private psychiatric review and private counselling for our son - many others would not have the resources to do this.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-11-08T09:36:03.3","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-11-10T11:56:25.843","readBy":[{"name":"Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust","count":13},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2020)","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/801887","id":"801887"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/801887/responses","id":"801887"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/801887/healthservices","id":"801887"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/801887/tags","id":"801887"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/gps-nottingham-city","id":"gps-nottingham-city","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rha-camhs-city","id":"rha-camhs-city","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/crisis","id":"crisis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ignored","id":"ignored"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/advice","id":"advice"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/camhs","id":"camhs"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/counselling","id":"counselling"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/depression","id":"depression"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/drug","id":"drug"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gp","id":"GP"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/overdose","id":"overdose"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/service%20provision","id":"service provision"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/suicide","id":"suicide"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/time%20wasted","id":"time wasted"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unhelpful","id":"unhelpful"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/802863","id":"802863"}]},{"id":802366,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Appalling","body":"I had a telephone appointment with them.

I had to wait over 4 months to see someone and a week before the appointment was told it would be by telephone. Despite this causing me great distrss they wouldn't allow me to see someone in person despite me not being in an at risk group. The person who spoke to me over the phone in regards to my collapsed vertebrae was incredibly cold and insensitive despite the clear distress I was in. They bluntly informed me I had osteoporosis and arthritis in the spine without any compassion. This life shattering news was told in passing as if it was nothing despite several times earlier on in the conversation having told of my suicidal feelings as a result of the pain ive suffered constantly the past 8 months. You'd think this news would have been handled delicately considering the state of mind I was in yet it wasn't and left me sobbing uncontrollably. The person clearly knew what they was talking about in regards to rheumatology though their interpersonal skills were atrocious. They came across uncaring and uninterested in my suffering the past 8 months as despite several times bringing up the distress being in pain has caused they never attempted to console me. While I know these are experts in rheumatology, not mental health, I'd still expect them to be able to show care and understanding though they just appeared heartless. Admitedly, I was hostile during the conversation because of being made to wait 4 months for a 20 minute phone call though this was exacerbated as a result of the person's attitude. After being bluntly informed of my disgnosis and left blubbering uncontrollably on the phone, I just hung up as I was getting no compassion from the person and couldn't talk anymore because of the emotional state I was in due to the way I'd been dealt with. The referral I received to see a spinal surgeon afterwards also made little reference to the mental distress my injury put me in. It also referred to me hanging up the phone but gave no context that I hung up while I was in emotional distress crying my eyes out in no small part because of the callus way I'd been dealt with.\nAll I request from the rheumatology department is first that you realise the importance of face to face appoinments with patients, eapecially those who are not in an at risk group. A face to face appointment means seeing in person the suffering a patient is in, not something that can happen over the phone. It also means being unable to see any deterioration that has happened between any scan and appointment. I also plead with you that when dealing with a patient with mental health issues that you make sure that you assign someone who has good personal skills to break any bad news as this can be the difference between them persevering or being pushed over the edge. Showing care and consideration is vital and so please could you assess which staff deal with patients as having a great knowledge of a subject just isn't enough.

Ward 3 were a huge support during what has been both a very anxious time for both me and my husband.  \r\nIt was agreed that as my pregnancy this time had been fairly straight forward I could Give birth in Elgin. I was overjoyed at this as my first daughter was born here also and I didn’t want to be too far away from her either when the time came.  \r\nI was due 3rd October but I was late and after many sweeps it was decided an induction would be the way. I couldn’t get an induction until the 12th! This was met with anxiety and huge worry as I felt this was far too long to leave me considering I’d had a still born 6 months previous so I was very anxious also I would have to stay in Aberdeen away from my daughter.  \r\nIt was agreed that I would get a cooks balloon inserted on the 11th in ward 3 and then the following day go to Aberdeen for induction. My baby’s heart rate before the balloon could even be inserted went up high. The two midwives said it didn’t look good and that my husband would need to take me straight to Aberdeen with no stopping. So I then had to organise last min child care for my daughter and rush through to Aberdeen with my husband. The journey through was awful we were sick with worry after losing our last baby the very thought of something being wrong just killed us. We arrived just after 5pm in ARI, my husband was allowed in! Baby and I were monitored for 2 hours baby’s heart rate normal. Cooks balloon was inserted and we then got told we could go home! After having nothing to eat as no time to get food before heading through we then decided we would just stay in a nearby hotel. We got a phone call the next morning at 8:30 to come in for 9am to be induced. Just aswell we stayed!  \r\nAll was well we got sent directly to the labour delivery suite room. Husband was allowed in again! The induction process started. Then I got told my baby’s heart rate was dipping with every contraction. A dr tried to put a clip on my baby’s head but this was accidentally clipped on the side of my cervix inside instead.. fast forward 3 hours later with just gas and air and extreme pain. They stopped the drip. The dr got consultant to try remove clip and suggested epidural. Which by the way was Great pain relief but I think should’ve been put in before they tried to remove clip! I cannot fault the midwives and I felt they were so unfairly rushed off their feet! They managed to get clip off with use of forceps. They then got the clip on my baby’s head and started the process of induction again. The consultant wanted a blood sample off my baby’s head to check oxygen levels. This was not possible. My baby’s heart rate continued to dip and was in distress so it was decided I would need emergency c section. I desperately did not want this as I knew my husband would need to go soon to offshore leaving me to recover alone with my 5 year old daughter. In the current state of things we could not afford for him to take more time off adding more anxiety. The staff in the theatre were fantastic and my son was born at 19:39.  \r\nMy husband had to leave soon after but was very much appreciative of the fact he got to cut the cord and see his son being born.  \r\nIn recovery I had a temperature and it was decided I and my son would need antibiotics IV. My son was wheeled away to have cannula put in. About midnight we got put on the ward and was told we wouldn’t be allowed home for a few days till I was well and my son was well too. I couldn’t fault the staff on the maternity ward. It gets so busy and you are left to it picking baby up and showering etc. I managed fine though. I did feel disappointed that I didn’t get told anything about what caused the infection that caused the temperature or any results of the bloods and swabs they took. Hardest part was my husband couldn’t visit unless he booked a time slot which was hard to get. He could only get a late in afternoon appointment and by then our daughter who was with grandparents would’ve been away for two nights so we both felt it would be better for him to head home to take care of her. I found this very difficult I often got upset during my stay missing my husband and daughter. Especially the fact they couldn’t get to see our son and brother. After everything we have gone through this was heart breaking. I understand it is about safety but very hard mentally to cope with.  \r\nDay 4- all was well and then at night time I asked for pain relief which I had been getting every night before bed to settle pain. The staff member I asked was very rude and said that the pain relief I wanted was too strong and shouldn’t be needed at this stage and couldn’t be given with paracetamol which I had already been getting previously. I’m a nurse so I know this to be false. The attitude was disgraceful. They said if I was that bad I would need to wait an hour and buzz for it. I was in pain and tears missing my family etc. Came back after an hour and gave me my the pain relief and to tell me I would be going home the next day anyways and wouldn’t be getting that sort of pain relief!  \r\nThe next day I asked the midwife as I hadn’t been told anything about my results or my sons recent blood results. Or anything really about treatment or what I should or shouldn’t do ie after having a section. The breast feeding nurse spent 10 mins with me then spent 2 hours with another patient, seemingly not bothered how I felt about my sons feeding as he has a tongue tie I’ve just discovered. The midwife who discharged me never came back to tell me results but came to tell me I was being discharged home in an hour. I told my husband and he left to come for us. I was told he wouldn’t be allowed onto ward to help me out to car either. I was discharged with paracetamol and told I wouldn’t be allowed any stronger pain relief for the journey home to Elgin.  \r\n  \r\nMy community midwife arrived the next day and told me I was allowed stronger pain relief and was entitled to diclofenac as well. Which I didn’t get from Aberdeen.  \r\nMy son is home healthy and well, I’m recovering well. I’m really grateful but I can’t help but feel let down and disappointed at how bad things have gotten. My 4 weeks post surgery and my husbands went offshore I feel very supported by the midwives, health visitor and ward 3. I wouldn’t wish this on any new mum and hope they get the services back to normal. This just isn’t safe and with the ever increasing population in Elgin they can’t keep sending people to Aberdeen and not use dr grays.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-11-08T15:46:03.65","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-11-10T12:50:31.697","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Grampian","count":9},{"name":"Scottish Government","count":1},{"name":"Ulster University, MBBS (Medicine) 2021","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/801909","id":"801909"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/801909/responses","id":"801909"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/801909/healthservices","id":"801909"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/801909/tags","id":"801909"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/n161h_501","id":"N161H_501","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/n411h_501","id":"N411H_501","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxious","id":"anxious"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disappointed","id":"disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disgraceful","id":"Disgraceful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/birth","id":"birth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breast%20feeding","id":"breast feeding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/c%20section","id":"c section"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cervix","id":"cervix"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/delivery","id":"delivery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/discharge","id":"discharge"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/epidural","id":"epidural"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/induction","id":"induction"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/infection","id":"infection"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/iv%20antibiotics","id":"iv antibiotics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/labour","id":"labour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/maternity","id":"maternity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pregnancy","id":"pregnancy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/recovery%20ward","id":"recovery ward"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/rushed","id":"rushed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/section","id":"section"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/service%20improvement","id":"service improvement"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attitude","id":"staff attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/temperature","id":"temperature"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/test%20results","id":"test results"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/theatre%20staff","id":"theatre staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/visiting","id":"visiting"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/some%20midwives","id":"some midwives"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain%20relief%20availability","id":"pain relief availability"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/802869","id":"802869"}]},{"id":802005,"author":"Lills","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Helping to cope with my depression and anxiety","body":"I participated in the living skillfilly course over video group meetings.  \r\nThis helped me to realise and come to terms with my situation and knowing that I was not alone in feeling depressed and suffering from. anxiety.  \r\nThe mindfulness, Tip, body scans skills helped me to control my emotions and distract myself from feeling low and anxious.  \r\nI used the skills to help with meditation, breathing exercises and to  \r\nConcentrate on what my body was telling me.

The nail on the head is today after phoning the very cold and rude receptionists who don't let me finish my sentences whilst being out of breathe with asthma and pregnant. I am polite and patient and instead have to ask them to let me finish what I'm saying. I came for a routine vaccine yesterday, sat down to have it done, to then be told I'm not far along enough in my pregnancy to have it. I decided to double check this today and 3 different opinions from my midwife, pharmacy and on the NHS website state its safe from 16 weeks. I'm now 19 and don't want to leave this and waste more time coming into a surgery during corona virus.\n\nToday a receptionist contradicted another receptionist'advice and told me that all reception staff are NOT qualified to give out medical advice. Why is it the last 5 times or so I have called, have I had a receptionist ask me personal questions or told me advice regarding my inhalers, and vaccines? If this is the case someone needs to review the phone line team because its confusing and misleading. Any member of public / patient is going to go with any advice given from a practice because we wouldn't expect to be given false or misleading advice.\n\nEvery time I call I'm always forced to practically beg for an appointment or phone appointment, or told to call back at 8.30. Is this really efficient and what about people who are unable to call at that time due to work commitments? It seems to be first come first served and I think that's extremely unfair to older more unhealthy /unable patients who I've personally met. Today I went to collect my repeat prescription; yet again, the pharmacy said I need to contact the GP to release it. I've been using this inhaler for months and months now, I've always done as I've been asked which is to order it online every single month without fail, but today was made to feel on the phone that it was my fault. I don't particularly feel leaving this review will change things, but seeing the rest of the reviews on here and Google, I would be very concerned if no improvements or training was implicated to this surgery, especially before more and more patients will be joining over the upcoming years. \n\nPlease take the time to see why the phone system and reception team are so poor. \n","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-11-10T15:10:05","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-11-10T16:24:03","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/802431","id":"802431"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/802431/responses","id":"802431"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/802431/healthservices","id":"802431"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/802431/tags","id":"802431"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/f81068","id":"F81068","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/asthma","id":"asthma"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/concerned","id":"concerned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good","id":"good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/head","id":"head"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/inhaler","id":"inhaler"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pharmacy","id":"Pharmacy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pregnancy","id":"pregnancy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pregnant","id":"pregnant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/safe","id":"safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20concerned","id":"very concerned"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/802981","id":"802981"}]},{"id":802430,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Excellent practice ","body":"I would just like to pass on our thanks to a wonderful team at the River Place group practice.

If I could I would like to identify every single healthcare worker who was part of the team, as no team can offer specialist care without the various team members regardless of their role. Suffice to say from Margaret, the day surgery scheduler (who worked hard to accommodate my clinic appointments and did so with kindness and efficiency & great patience) to my initial pre-op assessment carried out by truly wonderful nurses at Stobhill Hospital I have been grateful for the truly professional and caring manner shown to me.  \r\nAs a nurse myself I experience caring and compassionate staff every day. I just need to let management know that every day they are performing outstanding care under intense pressure. Ashley and Natalie were both nurses who I met initially who explained the procedures to me and walked me through the next stages. These nurses were professional, knowledgeable and just really kind and friendly. The excellent care continued through to day surgery at the New Victoria where the nursing and medical staff were first class. Lynne, Beth, Meg and Shirley provide superb nursing care and made me feel at ease and relaxed. They took great care of me. I had never met the medical team prior to the day of surgery but I was immediately at ease with them. The anaesthetics team were first class and Dr Higgins and her registrar need particular mention for their expert surgical care.  \r\nWe are all working hard within the NHS to deliver safe, effective care. I'd like to think I am a small part of the bigger picture delivering that care, but being on the receiving end is always strange. But I needed to mention the care I received and say thank you to everyone who provided that care. All of you deserve more than a few words of praise from me.  \r\nSpecial mention to my GP (Dr Ali). He is truly an excellent GP!","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-11-08T18:29:14.8633333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-11-10T16:26:42.087","readBy":[{"name":"St. Andrews University ScotGEM Medical Students","count":1},{"name":"East Renfrewshire Health & Social Care Partnership","count":1},{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":5}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/801919","id":"801919"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/801919/responses","id":"801919"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/801919/healthservices","id":"801919"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/801919/tags","id":"801919"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/g207h-day-surgery","id":"g207h-day-surgery","score":5},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/g306h_100","id":"G306H_100","score":5},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sj9-general-practices","id":"sj9-general-practices","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/caring","id":"caring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/day%20surgery","id":"day surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kind","id":"kind"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/knowledgeable","id":"knowledgeable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medical%20team","id":"Medical Team"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nursing%20care","id":"nursing care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pre-op%20assessment","id":"pre-op assessment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/safe","id":"safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassionate","id":"compassionate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/feel%20at%20ease","id":"feel at ease"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/patience","id":"patience"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/relaxed","id":"relaxed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wonderful","id":"wonderful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/whole%20team","id":"whole team"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/802437","id":"802437"}]}]
