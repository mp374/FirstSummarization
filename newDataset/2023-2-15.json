I feel broken by a system that claims to care for people in distress.  \r\nI appreciate that the services are now very overwhelmed but that doesn’t excuse the ongoing bigotry and attitudes towards patients with the diagnosis of BPD. I have been under the care of mental health services for over 30yrs with varying degrees of needs at different times. At times needing very little care, to in 2021 being sectioned.  \r\nAs I get older I feel my mental health has deteriorated to the point that last year I lost my job. The input I receive however is minimal. It involves a 30 minute appt every 3 to 4 months with a psychiatrist that doesn’t really listen.  \r\nI am unable to drive a car now so request a telephone appt as I refuse to be seen in the town where I live, due to a very abusive doctor. Yet every time I ring to request a phone call I’m interrogated by the receptionist. I’m told I need to be seen face to face for full assessment purposes. I understand the rationale but surely a phone call is better than no contact at all?  \r\nOn the day however there was no phone call as the message hadn’t been given to the psychiatrist so I rang and he did ring me back. My call with him in November 2022 was frustrating to say the least. He doesn’t really listen to what you’re saying.  \r\nAt the end of the phone call he told me I was encroaching on another patients time, as I was holding my phone to my ear and unable to know how long we’d been talking or that he had another patient. How did it become my fault for taking someone else’s time?  \r\nHe then said he had seen ten patients that day and said “That’s a lot isn’t it?” Not sure why his patient list had suddenly become my responsibility, was he trying to make me feel bad for him? He did however say at the end of the call he would refer me to the personality disorder service and for some more therapy, and try and get me some help.  \r\nI rang them today to find out the waiting times to be seen. I was told there was no referral. I’m told to reach out all the time: if you need help reach out. When I do reach out, most times I’m met with indifference, silence, judgement and blame.  \r\nThe last time I spoke to someone from the crisis team she said she wanted to “shake me!” And told me I needed to “Get a grip on this!” This kind of response is so unhelpful and unprofessional.  \r\nBefore I was sectioned I was trying to talk about being sexually assaulted to another crisis team nurse. She assumed I was talking about childhood experiences. Her response to me was “but you’re a grown man now!” How invalidating and dismissive is that response to someone’s trauma. How does that help someone by basically saying “get over it”. I didn’t even want to see the crisis team at that point, my former manager had insisted I was sectioned on the same day.  \r\nI’ve had some good experiences with some staff but the bad overshadow these. I didn’t choose to have things happen to me and I definitely didn’t choose to have BPD. Why on earth would someone choose such a destructive, harmful, demonised condition which leaves you open to verbal abuse, sarcasm, derision and bullying by some mental health professionals?  \r\nI’m so exhausted by it all now. I’m in my 50s now and feel very lost, scared and alone. I seem to have been blacklisted by my local mental health team as even after being sectioned, a referral was made from the ward to the CMHT and was immediately refused as now any intervention is just deemed to be of no benefit. I’m struggling with my mental health more than ever and the GP will say to contact my mental health team which consists of a psychiatrist I barely have any contact with.  \r\nSo I just say no thank you, I’d rather not talk and be dismissed, lectured or have sarcastic comments made. I don’t things will ever change. I think they will get worse but I’m one person with a stupid diagnosis, who’s going to listen to me?  \r\nI will eventually become another statistic and will be forever forgotten in a broken system that no longer cares about human beings. I’m just another PD on a conveyer belt of irritating patients. I’m so very tired now.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-02-14T11:38:53.0733333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-02-15T09:37:23.427","readBy":[{"name":"Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust","count":18}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1029812","id":"1029812"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1029812/responses","id":"1029812"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1029812/healthservices","id":"1029812"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1029812/tags","id":"1029812"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rha-amh-county-ns","id":"rha-amh-county-ns","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rha-crisis-midnotts","id":"rha-crisis-midnotts","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rha-millbrook","id":"RHA-millbrook","score":1},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/should%20listen","id":"Should listen"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bpd","id":"BPD"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/crisis%20team","id":"Crisis Team"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diagnosis","id":"diagnosis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/guilty","id":"guilty"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/personality%20disorder","id":"personality disorder"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/psychiatrist","id":"psychiatrist"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sectioned","id":"sectioned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/trauma","id":"trauma"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/worthless","id":"worthless"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/like%20a%20nuisance","id":"like a nuisance"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attitudes","id":"staff attitudes"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/like%20a%20criminal","id":"like a criminal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/demonized","id":"demonized"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1030417","id":"1030417"}]},{"id":1029106,"author":"MissusC","authorRoleId":3,"authorRole":"a parent/guardian","title":"NHS 24 and Out of hours urgent care Fife","body":"My son had a nasty earache.

I was met by Nurses Lesley Ann and Audrey who immediately put me at my ease, reassured me and explained the details of my possible condition in easy to understand language. They talked about alternative treatments and then proceeded to an examination. One never enjoys the process of intimate examination but the nurses were gentle and efficient and I had the most minimum of discomfort, very unlike a recent examination.  \r\nAnd here is the marked difference, the hospital visits I have had recently, including todays, were marked by courteous concern and reassuring treatment by both doctors and nurses. I have found when I try to communicate with my GP surgery an appointment is often unavailable, the doctor is not in or an appointment is rushed or I have to explain by remote diagnosis via an on line questionnaire, nor do I actually know who my doctor is. So my visit to the New Victoria was a hugely reassuring one. One that was also very emotional, where I felt a kindness and concern from a caring staff. Thank you Lesley Ann and Audrey. The NHS is our very heart without it untold misery and pain would ensue it would destroy so much hope and faith in our country. These nurses restored mine.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-02-12T13:04:09.7033333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-02-15T10:14:40.81","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":5}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1029127","id":"1029127"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1029127/responses","id":"1029127"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1029127/healthservices","id":"1029127"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1029127/tags","id":"1029127"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/nvh-gynae","id":"nvh-gynae","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/concern","id":"concern"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/worried","id":"worried"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/caring%20staff","id":"caring staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/consultation","id":"consultation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/efficient","id":"efficient"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/faith","id":"faith"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gentle","id":"gentle"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gyneacology","id":"gyneacology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kindness","id":"kindness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hope","id":"Hope"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassuring","id":"reassuring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/couteous","id":"couteous"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20at%20ease","id":"put at ease"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nhs%20staff","id":"nhs staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassuring%20nurse","id":"reassuring nurse"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1030307","id":"1030307"}]},{"id":1030256,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Beautiful people ","body":"For someone who has had little to do with doctors , hospitals etc , in general , .....

Never in a million years would I ever think of phoning an ambulance, but I was desperate. Arriving at Antrim area hospital, I was sent straight to EMSU C3. From the moment I stepped into the clinic room I felt safe, my biggest fear was I couldn't explain how I felt, I am rarely ill I am very much in tune with my body so I was so stressed and afraid of not being believed. I was taken for ultrasound scan and then MRI and met the consultant\\surgeon who was going to perform this surgery, and yes it was all that fast.  \r\nMr Eltayeb will be forever in my heart as one of the nicest people I ever met. This man is the leader of a team and I think this team are blessed to have him as a mentor, you cannot lead others effectively if you cannot communicate. It's inevitable we can hear through the thin veil of curtain, this man spoke to everyone in the same calming tone, explaining difficult procedures in the simplest way so we all could understand. I have never felt more content heading for surgery.  \r\nI want to mention other members of team EMSU at level 3. Rachael, Karthik, Baby, Siobhan, Sarah, the girl on ultra sound, the nurse and radiologist at MRI (they didn't have an easy patient) the anaesthetist, the nurse in theatre, and all the doctors Dr Lui. The after care was amazing, again Mr Eltayeb explained the procedure he had done and told it like he had baked the perfect victoria sponge :) This mans ability to communicate with empathy and understanding builds trust and respect with his patients, Antrim Area Hospital should feel proud to have him.  \r\nI never actually got to a proper ward, I was still on a trolley bed in the assessment unit from day one, the nurses continually apologised for this, it never bothered me in the slightest because of the excellent care I received. The wet slice of ham, lettuce and pineapple salad never tasted so good, it was my first bite in two days, but the icing on the cake for me was two ginger snap biscuits with a cup of tea, it tasted like afternoon tea at the Ritz. Not forgetting the lovely staff that served it.  \r\nFor all you male and females who choose nursing as a vocation you really have to be extra special people to go out of your way in order to make others feel better is exceptional. I will be forever grateful for my good experience in EMSU at Antrim Area Hospital, hopefully it will be my last trip for a very long while, so to all of you, while thank you seems inadequate, it's all I have :)  \r\n[Very happy with 'Treatment']","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-02-13T10:37:11.2","progress":"Story has a

Hospital. I got a call offering me an appointment for later that day. When I got to the Diabetes Centre I saw a Dr, then specialist nurse then a Dietician. As well as explaining everything to me they gave me all my medication and a glucometer. Following that first appointment I had a call with the nurse every few days to check how I was doing which meant I had that care and reassurance but I could also continue to work. The care and support I have received so far has been outstanding and I cannot praise everyone enough.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-02-13T10:58:53.2533333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-02-15T11:56:17.213","readBy":[{"name":"South Eastern Health and Social Care Trust","count":3}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1029249","id":"1029249"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1029249/responses","id":"1029249"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1029249/healthservices","id":"1029249"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1029249/tags","id":"1029249"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt004_07021-dc","id":"zt004_07021-dc","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/worried","id":"worried"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/advice","id":"advice"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diabetes","id":"diabetes"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diagnosis","id":"diagnosis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dietician","id":"Dietician"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/informed","id":"informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/joined%20up%20care","id":"joined up care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medications","id":"medications"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/outstanding","id":"Outstanding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/phone","id":"phone"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/praise","id":"praise"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/questions","id":"questions"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/quick","id":"quick"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassurance","id":"reassurance"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/referral","id":"referral"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/regular%20contact","id":"Regular contact"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/response","id":"response"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/specialist","id":"specialist"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20for","id":"cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported","id":"supported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/flexible","id":"Flexible"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/multidisciplinary%20team","id":"multidisciplinary team"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/everything%20explained","id":"everything explained"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/same%20day%20appointment","id":"same day appointment"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1030653","id":"1030653"}]},{"id":1029251,"author":"DoubleTrouble","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Can’t praise the staff enough.

A consultant came into the room to do a transvaginal ultrasound and a FY1 followed in with the consultant however, they never even introduced themselves to me (I only now know their name from my discharge letter) and during the scan, while my legs were in stirrups and I was extremely exposed, they wandered around the room. This left me with very little dignity. After the scan, I had asked the FY1 questions about what was found and they informed me that they were not sure as they were not a gynaecologist. I had been asked by a consultant to do a self swab so I closed the door and the blue curtain to do this and as I was pulling my dress down, the FY1 entered my room without knocking or asking to come in.  \r\nI had been told the previous night that I needed to fast for the ultrasound as they wanted to look at organs other than my reproductive organs, to rule out other causes, however this did not happen. The general surgeons were asked to review me based off the scans of my reproductive organs and unsurprisingly the general surgeons did not see a need to intervene as these scans were mostly normal. After reviewing my scans, the general surgeon still had to clarify with me whether or not I had both ovaries and fallopian tubes which is concerning. I had waited from 10am until 4:30pm for the general surgeons to review these scans which they knew were mostly normal and also not the area which general surgery is concerned about as a scan of my liver and kidneys were not done as stated the previous night. I could have returned home after this scan instead of being made hopeful that something may be done or found.  \r\nI was informed that my only option now was to stay for pain management but no other investigations were going to be carried out as they are unsure what is causing the pain. I became very upset by this as I obviously wanted to know why I was in so much pain and after suffering for years before being diagnosed with endometriosis, being told we do not know is very deflating especially when the only investigations carried out was a set of bloods and a transvaginal ultrasound. I found the FY1 did not show any sympathy and just stared awkwardly.  \r\nAfter reviewing my discharge letter, I found a number of problems with it and asked to speak with a doctor to clarify some points. The FY1 was sent to discuss these with me. For the first few minutes, they did not bother to close the door despite me being very upset and crying and other patients having visitors at that time. However, all the issues I had found were brushed off as not being important so I chose to leave without them being corrected.  \r\nI was diagnosed with endometriosis in 2019 but as this pain is significantly different to what I am used to, I would have thought at least an abdominal ultrasound would have been carried out, as stated, to rule out nearby organs causing the pain. But instead, I was sent home with the same we don’t know I had to deal with for the 3 years prior to my endometriosis diagnosis.  \r\nI found the FY1 was extremely dismissive, ill-informed and lacked bedside manners. Despite giving both themselves and the consultant a copy of my current and past medications, they were unsure what I was on and what I have tried previously. I had asked her twice to speak with the consultant about an anti-spasmodic but never got back to me about this so I am unsure if they ever did. Entering rooms with the curtain closed, wandering the room during a transvaginal ultrasound and not closing the door during a conversation when a patient is very upset showed me a total lack of self awareness and bedside manner. And due to this, my discharge letter is riddled with inaccuracies which have not been corrected and I will not be comfortable seeking care for the same problem in future.  \r\nIn addition, due to being discharged at 7pm on a Saturday, I was sent home without an adequate supply of pain relief to last me until Monday.

I know the name of the nurse but don't feel right naming and shaming publicly.  \r\nThis is not a positive experience I am afraid. I am writing on behalf of my mother who within the last 6 months has been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and has been trying to adjust. I know that there are many pleasant, kind and caring health care workers as I work closely with several different departments.  \r\nMy mother has been dealing with a particular nurse at the medical practice. The way in which my nearly 60 year old mother has been made to feel is like a child and not an adult. I would also like to say that she is very anxious about me writing this because this is a person (the nurse) the public should look up to, respect and not expect to be belittled by. As a result my mother is afraid to speak out.  \r\nFrom what I have been told, very little support has been given to my mother during the last 6 months following on from her diagnosis. It is like she has just been told to get on with it. It has been very hard for her to come to terms with this new diagnosis as she doesn't understand why it has happened to her (amongst other things, heart disease, fibromyalgia).  \r\nMy mother has advised me of the following incidents or things that have been said to my mother by the nurse:  \r\nMy mother has had 2 stents fitted and is on 3 different medications a day for this particular reason. My mum attended an appointment expecting a heart review and to discuss her diabetes. My mother was informed I will not be doing your heart review today as the diabetes is more important.  \r\nMy mother has had palpitations for as long as I can remember. She had advised the nurse that she was getting palpitations in her neck, to which the nurse stated that will be lack of hormones that is causing the palpitations in your neck, which is fine, however I think a little bit more clarification is needed here. Please explain further what is meant by this - reassure her that you are aware of her heart condition, and it is normal to think the palpitations are a result of this but that it is actually something else. My mother is also on medication for menopause. The nurse also told my mother that she does not have Fibromyalgia, it will be lack of hormones for whatever it is she is feeling right now.  \r\nWe have a family friend who informed my mother that they give out glucose monitors to diabetic patients - when my mother enquired the nurse about this, she stated I don't give out monitors as they aren't helpful as blood sugars go up and down throughout the day.  \r\nMy mother had a follow up telephone appointment with the nurse to discuss levels etc. My mothers Hb1a readings had come down by 6 between the first and second reading. Instead of supporting my mother, the nurse abruptly asked what carbs are you eating?. It was only after my mother told the nurse that she had also lost 12lb between the first reading and second reading that the nurses tone changed.  \r\nAn English NHS diabetic food list was printed and given to my mother - this is absolutely fine, but again it was handed to her and that was that. No discussion. She was also told to download the Freshwell app. I work in clinical trials, and things need to be explained thoroughly to participants so that they completely understand the why's, what's and how's. I feel like this particular nurse is missing the mark when it comes to ensuring patients are comfortable, listened to and properly cared for.  \r\nMy mother is not finding this nurse to be reassuring or considerate at all which is extremely disappointing. Yes diabetes is manageable and you can live with it, but my mothers life changed over night and she had no idea where to start. She is still confused and is having to look up things by herself or ask other friends/family members who are also diabetic how they manage. This should not be happening.  \r\nI am not asking you to hand hold but please show people who are being diagnosed with any disease, regardless of severity, that you care about their wellbeing and that you want to help. Nobody want's their parents or family members being treated this way so I have had enough.  \r\nAgain, I want to make it very clear that I have worked, and still work with many great, amazing and fantastic doctors and nurses. It just breaks my heart every time my mother comes back from an appointment feeling deflated. I hope this can be resolved, I am sorry it has had to come to this.

The staff were welcoming, friendly and above all professional in their treatment of me and other patients who attended the unit. I spent five and half weeks having treatment on a daily basis and although there were delays occasionally due to pressures on the technicians and nurses they always were friendly, affable and carried out their work in an efficient and organised way.  \r\nBefore retirement I was an academic in a Business School and travelled all over the world visiting many business organisations in a variety of contexts. Some of them were hospitals but most were in the private sector. One can tell whether an organisation is doing well by the reception one initially receives and the general air of friendliness from dedicated staff. This is not always the case in many private companies. I was struck by the dedication and professionalism of your staff and would like them to receive some kind of thanks from the senior levels of your organisation.  \r\nOne of the staff, Christian, told me he was studying for a diploma in radiotherapy and he related to me his final thesis and how he wished to carry on his studies to Masters degree level. He said he was reliant on getting a grant from the trust. If he does receive such a grant I know he will continue to be a great asset to the unit and the Hospital as is the leader of the team Sarah.  \r\nFrom my perspective Northampton Genera Hospital is a well run organisation in which I received friendliness and help from staff at reception to support staff who offered me a ride down the long Hospital Street.  \r\nI thank your staff for an impressive experience in such harrowing and distressful times.  \r\n[Very happy with 'Staff attitude']  \r\n  \r\n[Very happy with 'Staff skills']  \r\n","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-02-13T12:11:44.4666667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-02-15T13:36:50.717","readBy":[{"name":"Northampton General Hospital NHS Trust","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1029296","id":"1029296"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1029296/responses","id":"1029296"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1029296/healthservices","id":"1029296"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1029296/tags","id":"1029296"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rns01_300","id":"RNS01_300","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dedicated%20staff","id":"dedicated staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helpful%20staff","id":"helpful staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professional","id":"professional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/radiotherapy","id":"radiotherapy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attitude","id":"staff attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20very%20friendly","id":"staff very friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support%20staff","id":"support staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/welcoming","id":"welcoming"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/well%20run","id":"well run"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendliness","id":"friendliness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/impressed","id":"impressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/relieved","id":"relieved"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reception%20staff","id":"reception staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/excellent%20team","id":"excellent team"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/an%20asset","id":"an asset"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1030362","id":"1030362"}]},{"id":1029307,"author":"hadargt78","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"The value of the multi-faceted care provision","body":"For last 8 weeks l have had the support of Zoe, Physio Support Worker, Domiciliary Physio Service, Brooksby, Largs, North Ayrshire.

Consultants made examinations fun and light hearted. Even the worst procedures were done with such care and attempts to make them not scary. The play assistants regularly checked to see if he wanted toys swapping to keep him occupied and they have a wonderful selection.  So much so he didn't want to leave!  One of the play assistants showed him her beautiful disney paintings in the conservatory. \n\nThe Consultants are knowledgeable, informative and very thorough. We saylw many different people and I cannot fault any of them.  The nurses and health care assistants give you all of their time. Constantly checking if my son needed anything. You can see how busy they are but that never comes across and we had such good care.

I was full of fear around a medical issue and in that became somewhat chaotic and confused in asking questions and retaining information.  Through all of it the young receptionist remained kind and helpful.  \nLater that day when I processed my visit to the surgery and the calmness I received in my chaos, I realized that our receptions are front line workers.  They are the first people the patients see.  They are the first ones who are subjected to the fears, frustrations, and angers of those of us who are worried about our health or the health of our children.  They are the ones we sometimes expect an answer from with regards to our medical conditions…questions they are unable to answer.  On top of this they need to be answering the many phone calls to the surgery, constantly be accessing the computer to make/change appointments, and often trying to juggle appointments when someone needs to cancel or change ones already made.

When I was discharged home I was seen by the respiratory nurses because I was on oxygen. Before I took covid I had COPD but it was well managed. I used to go to the gym and do spin. The respiratory nurses and physio came out to me at home. I had physio and got my oxygen levels checked when I was walking. The respiratory nurses thought that the Long Covid Clinic would be good for me. I went to the rehab classes in Mid Ulster hospital they helped me to get my strength back. The clinics were brilliant, they gave me confidence again and gave me the opportunity to speak to other people. In ICU I had dreams and hallucinations, when I was coming out of the coma, I thought I was going doolally. The classes gave me the chance to speak to other people who had experienced the same sort of thing as me, I was reassured this had happened to other people as well, I wasn’t on my own.  \r\nOne day Elaine came to talk to us, that was very good, she explained a lot of things, about the dreams, about the energy that had been taken from me. When I was at the classes I cried a lot, Elaine approached me and offered me the opportunity to speak to her. I had a couple of sessions with Elaine, she helped me to understand this is the way it is. She referred me to a psychologist, Hanna, she just let me talk through things. The way she approached me helped me to talk it out. I can’t remember much about being unwell and coming into hospital. But I do remember before I went into coma, I asked the doctor what my chances were for survival, he said, ‘Not great’. He advised me to say anything I wanted to, to my children that affected me very badly. At the time I was so exhausted I just wanted to go to sleep but when I got home it hit me what could have been.  \r\nThe rehab only lasted 6 weeks but they put me through the 6 weeks a 2nd time. It was great, I miss it, it gave me a purpose in life, something to get up and do, to get going.  \r\nI still think about the dreams, I still feel on edge and confused if I wake up from sleeping. I really think I still need support, although when I finished the sessions with Elaine and Hanna I thought I was OK.  \r\nMy experience of the rehab clinic was excellent, they couldn’t have done any more for me.  \r\nMy GP didn’t even know I was in hospital, till I came out, he has rang me once since I was discharged, I have had very little contact with him.  \r\nRehab twice a week gave me motivation, now days any outing for me is to a hospital appointment. Covid has changed my life a lot.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-02-14T09:42:12.6833333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-02-15T14:23:14.173","readBy":[{"name":"Northern Health and Social Care Trust","count":10},{"name":"Patient and Client Council","count":1},{"name":"Public Health Agency","count":1},{"name":"Ulster University, Faculty of Life and Health Sciences","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1029767","id":"1029767"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1029767/responses","id":"1029767"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1029767/healthservices","id":"1029767"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1029767/tags","id":"1029767"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt002_24026-ot-recovery","id":"ZT002_24026-ot-recovery","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt002-chpplcs","id":"zt002-chpplcs","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt002-chprs","id":"zt002-chprs","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/worried","id":"worried"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/being%20listened%20to","id":"Being listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/more%20classes","id":"More classes"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/oxygen","id":"oxygen"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/physio","id":"physio"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/psychologist","id":"psychologist"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/respiratory","id":"respiratory"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/long%20covid","id":"long covid"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gp%20follow%20up","id":"gp follow up"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1030695","id":"1030695"}]},{"id":1029855,"author":"Jadss85","authorRoleId":3,"authorRole":"a parent/guardian","title":"Excellent support from A&E staff","body":"I'd just like to provide some feedback regarding a member of staff at Doncaster hospital who was working in A&E.  \r\nShe was a lovely lady with dark hair, I think she had glasses too, she was on the left desk as you walk through the main doors into A&E at 12pm when I checked my daughter in.

Not much has changed, except the toilet/showers do now have signs specifying Gents or Ladies. Previously men were regularly using what staff had told me were the ladies’ toilets. One thing that was worse was the constantly ringing unanswered telephone that was on the edge of the bay, adding to the general stress of the ward.  \r\nI find it extraordinary that the government and Tayside Health Board think it is acceptable to have mixed sex wards and bays in some cases, including AMU, Ninewells. For the Health Board to stress the importance of privacy and dignity is deeply cynical, while using mixed bays as standard procedure and, particularly, when the beds are in such close proximity to each other that it is impossible to avoid hearing all the private details of other patients' symptoms and circumstances when discussed with doctors or nurses who don't seem to feel it necessary to even lower their voices.  \r\nOn this occasion, the patient in the next bed wasn't even given the decency of a curtain pulled round the bed although clearly embarrassed when called upon to discuss his symptoms with staff and even more so when he started to vomit.  \r\nThe elderly man across the way from me was fortunate enough to have the curtain drawn around him before the doctor loudly explained to him that he was going to give him a physical rectal examination and proceeded to explain in great detail how exactly that was going to be done. Unbelievably, this examination was then carried out right there with all the other patients cringing at the shouts of pain from the poor man. This seems to be very much lacking in terms of respecting privacy or dignity and I personally, found the situation deeply upsetting.  \r\nOn a separate issue, I pointed out to the nurse that I had brought my own prescribed medicines but I hadn’t been given any of them all day. She said that I would have to do without them because the doctor hadn’t written them up. I asked for them back but was refused.  \r\nWhen I was discharged, on Friday evening, my medicines still hadn't been returned to me. I would have had to go all weekend without any of them if it hadn't been for my wonderful pharmacist helping me out with emergency prescriptions.  \r\nI did get my medicines delivered to me by Ninewells on the following Monday, with a note attached, saying “left in ward”. Strange, I thought it would be the staff’s responsibility to give them back to me on discharge.  \r\nThe combined effect of my having suffered being a patient at AMU, Ninewells on three occasions is that I will not go back there, no matter what the circumstances.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-02-13T15:10:22.4566667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-02-15T14:39:06.053","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Tayside","count":7}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1029362","id":"1029362"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1029362/responses","id":"1029362"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1029362/healthservices","id":"1029362"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1029362/tags","id":"1029362"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/t101h-acute-medical-unit","id":"T101H-acute-medical-unit","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stressed","id":"stressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency","id":"emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medicines","id":"medicines"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mixed%20sex%20ward","id":"mixed sex ward"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/noise","id":"noise"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dignity","id":"Dignity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lack%20of%20privacy","id":"lack of privacy"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1031937","id":"1031937"}]},{"id":1029519,"author":"simpsla","authorRoleId":4,"authorRole":"a relative","title":"Great care and compassion shown to my Father","body":"My Dad recently took ill requiring him to be admitted to Monklands Hospital.

I believed I was in the worst hotel in Portugal, I just wanted to get home. I rang my wife asking her to get me home, my mind was totally gone. My grandson told me the flight was booked to get me home that settled me down but I fought tooth and nail to get out of hospital.  \r\nWe live in a bungalow, previously my wife had been unwell we had grab handles in place for her, before I took covid I wasn’t using them, but they were there for me when I got home. I had lost 3 stone in weight, I could hardly walk, if I turned my head at all I was dizzy. I had two legs that didn’t look like my own they had lost muscle mass they were wee fine legs. I was using a rolator and still on oxygen. I was able to get out of bed and walk to the toilet that was enough, I had to build up my strength slowly.  \r\nThe hospital referred me to the Community Respiratory Nurses, Peter saw me the very next day at home. . I was delighted to get home I hadn’t seen my family in 3 weeks, my wife had covid locked in the house, I had it, locked in the hospital.  \r\nPeter provided advise, exercises and encouragement to keep going and not to over do it, although I know I did it. I tried to do too much when I was walking and became dizzy, this was months after I got out of hospital, I was staggering about all over the place. I didn’t want anyone to see me incase they thought I was drunk, that was about 11’oclock in the morning.  \r\nPeter also arranged for me to attend, a twice weekly, 6 week duration rehab programme. It was excellent, Peter and Marie ran it, the simple fact that you were talking to people who had gone through the same as me, I realised I wasn’t doting and everything I had experienced was real.  \r\nPeter also arranged for Elaine to contact me, if it hadn’t have been for Peter and Elaine, I feel I would have taken my own life. They helped me so much. I had terrible feelings of guilt because I was depending on everyone else to do things for me, I had to pay people to cut my grass and hedges, my wife had to bring my tea into me. Elaine helped me to accept that for the past 63 years I have helped everyone else now it’s time for them to help me. I felt there were are brighter days ahead.  \r\nThe best thing about it all is meeting people who have been through the same thing and being able to talk about it, I now join Elaine’s zoom meetings. Lately I have had difficulty with my eyes and through this meeting I have discovered other people with the same or similar problems.  \r\nIn December I was back in hospital with pneumonia, I felt anxious, I had rung the GP and got an appointment with the nurse practitioner. I got antibiotics but my breathing got worse, I rang the doctor, they told me I needed to go the hospital, I was back on oxygen. I feel like covid has made me 20 years older than I am. I was always a big strong man who could lift anything I wanted to without thinking about it, but now there are things I can’t do. I don’t feel depressed, but it was hard to accept how much covid has changed my life.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-02-14T12:19:11.9433333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-02-15T14:47:50.533","readBy":[{"name":"Northern Health and Social Care Trust","count":6},{"name":"Patient and Client Council","count":1},{"name":"Public Health Agency","count":1},{"name":"Ulster University, Faculty of Life and Health Sciences","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1029839","id":"1029839"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1029839/responses","id":"1029839"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1029839/healthservices","id":"1029839"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1029839/tags","id":"1029839"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt002-chpplcs","id":"zt002-chpplcs","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt002-chprs","id":"zt002-chprs","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breathing","id":"breathing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/encouraged","id":"encouraged"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/oxygen","id":"oxygen"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/psychology","id":"psychology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/respiratory","id":"respiratory"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported","id":"supported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid","id":"covid"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/long%20covid","id":"long covid"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/post%20covid%20syndrome","id":"post covid syndrome"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/respiratory%20nurses","id":"respiratory nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/rehab%20programme","id":"rehab programme"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%20support%20group","id":"covid support group"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1030697","id":"1030697"}]},{"id":1029349,"author":"Rich23","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Poor service.","body":"Have been trying to contact the department today 14 times and no one picks up the phone.
