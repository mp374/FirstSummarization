Firstly we would love to thank Jennifer, our midwife in labour ward, who supported us through a stressful and complicated birth resulting in an unplanned c-section, and her aftercare while in recovery was above and beyond.  \r\nAlso to the theatre staff, in particular Roxy who performed the procedure and Kevin the anaesthetist who made me feel so safe in labour ward and theatre (I was terrified of having any form of medication given that I had previous drug allergies, but felt Kevin who took the time to listen to my concerns and explained and reassured myself and partner throughout the process.  \r\nHowever we had a really unpleasant experience with the antenatal clinic. Having had a straightforward pregnancy and being on the green pathway right through and also planning for community midwife led birth, I found it deeply frustrating having to attend the antenatal clinic at Aberdeen Maternity Hospital (AMH). The doctor we were seen by at the clinic on our last visit failed to introduce themselves so we have no idea who they are. Both my partner and I felt our opinions and wishes were completely ignored during this appointment. Their approach was very impersonal and felt like we were being forced to book interventions that weren‚Äôt discussed or explained at all and there was no informed consent. After eventually telling us they were going to get a leaflet, they returned with the consultant without informing us this was happening. Our experience in clinic ruined the end of what had been a perfect and happy pregnancy.  \r\nWe also feel let down by the level of aftercare from Inverurie Community Maternity Unit (CMU) following the birth of our first baby. Having had complications with my own health after birth, and it being in writing on hospital discharge letter for the community midwife to re-check my blood pressure prior to discharge and to refer to GP for ongoing treatment. This never happened. Which resulted in me having no medication for 2 weeks, and ultimately calling nhs24 and a re-admission to triage for treatment. A hospital admission which likely could have been avoided had appropriate follow up care and prescription been in place. Also, failure to provide adequate information to our health visitor team regarding a 13% weight loss of our baby and re-admission for feeding support, which would be important for them to understand in regards to her development.  \r\nOur health visitor services have been brilliant and provided so much more support in relation to feeding and continue to provide excellent care. Anne in particular has been so helpful in the early days following the arrival of our first baby and we are very grateful for her support and communication.","criticality":"moderately

service user","title":"Our trust in healthcare professionals is now strained.","body":"We had to take our daughter t the paediatric assessment unit in Aberdeen children‚Äôs hospital at night, due to having 20+ clusters of seizures in that day; that are worsening & progressive. She was already assessed for having 12-14 seizure episodes a couple of days before this. We were promptly taken through to the ward upon arrival. Put into triage 5 room by a nurse, that had bright lights, very hot and no ventilation.  \r\nAbout 5 hours later, a speciality 1 doctor came to take bloods from my daughters foot, they attempted the toe but failed and the nurse said they were using too much paraffin on her left big toe as the tube was slipping, combined with my daughter clenching her toes made it very tricky - the doctor was great with her, kept her calm and was empathetic towards her. She tolerated it much better than we all expected and said how great she was doing, however the doctor was failing to get sufficient drops of blood from the toe and moved to her heel on the opposite foot. The doctor unfortunately did the same again, using too much paraffin which made the tube slip on her foot but my daughter was still doing great, considering she had 25 episodes of seizures, in a very hot room, strange place and incredibly tired and exhausted.  \r\nThe nurse who admitted us on arrival and took my daughters' first set of observations decided to take over as my baby‚Äôs foot was bleeding and the blood test was needed (totally understandable). However this is where my babies discomfort, and ours as parents changed. The nurse used such pressure and force to get the blood from her heel that she bent her right foot back so far that her toes were in line with her shin of her lower half of her leg. My baby was absolutely distraught and screaming, in what very much so seemed like a lot of pain.  \r\nMy daughter clearly displayed better than expected behaviour when having her toe and heel cut two times by the doctor and blood drawn by them, she was curious to see what was happening and we managed a little distraction with rattles and sucrose drops, and without this awfully distressing response. Nor did they need to bend her foot back so far. Nor did we experience this when having bloods taken multiple times for blood sugars, or the heel prick test when in NICU for 6 days when first born.  \r\nI stated to the nurse than they were hurting my daughter and they ignored me, they also ignored how distraught my daughter was. Zero empathy to an already very unpleasant situation we were in with worry about our daughter, and how she had been kept awake in horrible conditions. How she‚Äôd been taken up to hospital, for seizures with an unknown cause outside of the usual reasons with babies, and due to this I was a bit worried about putting her through more but my daughter was doing so well until it felt like this nurse brutally bent her foot back to obtain a blood sample. The nurse very clearly displayed their frustrations with the doctor who failed 2 attempts. Bloods were required because we couldn‚Äôt establish a cause, but brute force and zero empathy for a small baby was not necessary and only caused us as first time parents and my child undue distress and trauma.  \r\nI would like this nurse to be retrained on patient ethics and empathy towards children and parents who were clearly concerned. Perhaps retraining on taking bloods from children who are curious and pleasant, as I would hate to think how a child would be treated if they put up any resistance. At no point were we even asked if someone in training could take the bloods - given these circumstances we would have probably declined to minimise the distress imposed on our child.  \r\nI would like this to be dealt with so no other child has to endure this kind of treatment, and so that no parents have to watch their child be treated this way when not well. My daughter is still having progressive seizures, sleeping more than usual and lower appetite than usual, so it is likely we will need more investigation despite a normal ECG & EEG. So we would hope that we never have to experience this ever again because our trust in healthcare professionals is now strained.","criticality":"moderately

They sit back and look down on you when they answer you, that's if they can be bothered to provide you with a half decent informative answer as if they are doing you a favour. They want to know all your information and then do absolutely nothing with it, by now everyone at reception has heard your private details. Loxford really needs to train its reception staff.

She was professional, thorough, also gentle and kind. She made a painful experience much more bearable. I felt that she really cared about me in a very short period of time. I was then taken to have an ultrasound. I was asked to wait in the small changing room.  \r\nThis is a message to the ultrasound staff - patients in the changing room can hear what you are saying.  \r\nI heard a staff member take a phone call.  \r\nI heard them suggest that this was a waste of time, that an ultrasound wasn't needed, that they wished mammogram would just send people on their \"merry\" way.  \r\nI have a high instance of cancer in my family and I did not feel \"merry\".

I must admit she was excellent, she came out to start with when he left Hospital to see how he managed to go up and down stairs because he was very weak. When he came out, my son put in a double banister, so she made sure he was okay getting up and down stairs and arranged for bathroom aids so he could use the bathroom without my assistance. Eventually she came again and took him for a wee walk, just between a few lampposts, then she came back again and did the same, maybe going a little further. Then she offered to take him out again. But I said I think we were okay at that point. She did then phone a week or so ago to see how he was getting on and how we were coping, we spoke about getting a wheelchair I was going to buy, she gave me a phone number to help get a wheelchair, and she phoned to see how I got on with that. My husband said she was absolutely fantastic.  \r\nHe came out of hospital with covid, so we both had it, so the help we got from some of the other agencies wasn‚Äôt very good, but the OT service were excellent, and as soon as he was over covid they got in touch and his OT came out to see him. I think she is now saying she is going to speak to the heart nurse about accessing physio, I think she said she could refer him for that.  \r\nThe OT taking him out for a walk helped him build his confidence, giving tips to him, which made him feel more confident, that was great. He‚Äôs only seen a heart nurse face to face once, partly because of covid when he first left hospital. So I‚Äôm a bit disappointed about that, that it is just a telephone appointment he has with the heart nurse, because I think a lot can be said about seeing someone face to face. The cardiology nurse is based at Ninewells, they phone up, and they are very nice on the phone don‚Äôt get me wrong, but it‚Äôs usually me they're speaking to as my husband sometimes gets a bit confused about he medication he‚Äôs on, and the nurse is usually phoning about medication, so they end up speaking to me, but I think it would be better to have that discussion face to face so my husband can be included. I‚Äôm sure the reason we can‚Äôt have more face to face appointments with the heart nurse is probably because of staffing issues, but it is disappointing to only have these phone call and have only seen them face to face once.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-05-12T14:09:10.84","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-05-15T09:20:03.733","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Tayside","count":8},{"name":"Perth and Kinross Health & Social Care Partnership","count":7},{"name":"Scottish Government","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1065004","id":"1065004"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1065004/responses","id":"1065004"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1065004/healthservices","id":"1065004"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1065004/tags","id":"1065004"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/s37000023-pkcs-ot-nrth","id":"S37000023-pkcs-ot-nrth","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/t101h_320","id":"T101H_320","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/advice","id":"advice"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/heart%20failure","id":"heart failure"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/occupational%20therapist","id":"occupational therapist"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/more%20face%20to%20face","id":"more face to face"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1067855","id":"1067855"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1069747","id":"1069747"}]},{"id":1065833,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Accessible GP","body":"I was able to arrange a F2F appointment within a fortnight / The appointment was on time / A way forward was agreed.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2023-05-10T14:14:53","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-05-15T09:21:13","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1065833","id":"1065833"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1065833/responses","id":"1065833"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1065833/healthservices","id":"1065833"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1065833/tags","id":"1065833"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/h85009","id":"H85009","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/in%20the%20way","id":"in the way"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1066235","id":"1066235"}]},{"id":1065841,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Worst Surgery ","body":"Worst surgery, made me wait for more than 40 minutes for my appointment, I had to cancel at the end and go, awful Experience","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2023-05-10T14:19:29","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2023-05-15T09:21:27","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1065841","id":"1065841"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1065841/responses","id":"1065841"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1065841/healthservices","id":"1065841"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1065841/tags","id":"1065841"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/ratmg","id":"RATMG","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/awful","id":"awful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"}]},{"id":1065840,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Great practice ","body":"This was my first time with Healthshare and I was very impressed with them.

I was diagnosed with multiple large gallstones by ultrasound in January 2023 and advised I would likely need surgery due to how symptomatic I was and how large my gallstones were.  \r\nMy consultation with the general surgeon at Chelsea & Westminster hospital was supposed to be in March but delayed by NHS strikes to April.  \r\nIn April I let the surgeon know I had been increasingly unwell, having intermittent fevers, losing weight as I am often vomiting or scared to eat. The consultation was very short and the consultant told me I was not yet on a surgical waiting list and needed an MRI to check I had no stones blocking my ducts first.  \r\nThe consultant told me following the MRI I would need to come back to see him before he would list me for surgery, which he said is another 12 week minimum wait. I pleaded with the consultant to add me to the surgery wait list in the meantime as I was barely able to tolerate food and on an extremely low calorie diet as a result.  \r\nAlthough the consultant was medically knowledgeable, I felt he was dismissive of the impact my condition is having on my daily life as he told me to simply follow a low fat diet and to attend A&E if needed.  \r\nI cried following my appointment as I had been so patient waiting months for this appointment and really thought I would get a definitive date for surgery or at least know I was on a waiting list but I felt still completely in the dark about timescales and powerless to do anything about my own health.  \r\nThe MRI happened 4 weeks later (during which time I remained very ill, even fainting at work), but I was only given an appointment date a whole 4 months later to discuss the MRI (end of august).  \r\nI have since managed to get a consultation sooner (June). But I am suffering so much with daily intense pain, nausea, and vomiting that this still feels ages away. I have lost 6kgs in 6 weeks and I was not overweight to begin with. I am taking codeine and antiemetics daily and I am now vomiting on a daily basis.  \r\nI have asked my GP for antidepressants as my mood and quality of life has been totally eroded by this and some days I actually think I am dying the pain is so bad. I can no longer commit to or enjoy social plans or holidays and I am worried I will lose my job and be put on statutory sick pay as I am having attacks at work and my performance is suffering.  \r\nI went to A&E a few weeks ago during an attack but although the staff were lovely and efficient, they said my bloodwork was fine and told me to come back only if I have a fever or develop jaundice as they can't offer me the surgery unless I develop emergency complications. At this stage I am hoping for emergency complications so I can have some resolution to my situation.  \r\nI have no savings to afford private surgery as it's several thousands of pounds and I am having to consider borrowing money to go abroad to have the surgery, which I resent as a taxpayer who is not able to afford such an expense.  \r\nOnline I have found out about S2 funding options to have the surgery funded in Europe but not sure if the NHS would agree this as they consider me non urgent? I have also tried to ask to change hospitals as my treatment falls outside the 18 week waiting time but been discouraged from doing this by the hospital as according to the admin they said I have \"already started my care at Chelsea\" and switching hospitals would reset the waiting time to zero?  \r\nI contacted PALS and spoke to someone on the phone who said they would look into my case and call me back but nobody did.  \r\nAt this stage I actually dread waking up in the morning as it's such a struggle through the day. I feel totally in the dark about my options and likely timescales- why can't this be communicated to me as an adult whose entire life is currently on hold?  \r\nI understand and am sympathetic to the system pressures the NHS is under but communication is key, if I at least had a timeframe I could make a decision about whether I can afford to wait.  \r\nIt would also be good if the NHS has no capacity to operate on patients if they could at least proactively transfer you to another hospital or offer to part fund private treatment elsewhere or at least advertise the S2 funding route. Instead it feels patients are discouraged from trying to navigate or reorganise their care.  \r\nAlso, the advice to attend A&E every time I have pain lasting more than half an hour (which is every day!) is more costly for the NHS in the long run than elective surgery within reasonable timeframes and adds pressure on A&E staff who either have to just send patients home with painkillers after said patient has been several hours waiting to be seen or they are forced to operate on an emergency basis for something that could have happened in a safer planned way.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-05-14T00:33:19.9166667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-05-15T09:38:10.15","readBy":[{"name":"Chelsea and Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1065374","id":"1065374"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1065374/responses","id":"1065374"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1065374/healthservices","id":"1065374"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1065374/tags","id":"1065374"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rqm01_301","id":"RQM01_301","score":2},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/a&e%20staff","id":"A&E staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/antidepressants","id":"antidepressants"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/complications","id":"complications"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/consultant","id":"consultant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/costs","id":"COSTS"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/discouraged","id":"discouraged"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dismissed","id":"dismissed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/efficient","id":"efficient"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency%20care","id":"emergency care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/funding","id":"funding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gallbladder","id":"gallbladder"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lovely","id":"lovely"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/low%20mood","id":"Low mood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mri%20scan","id":"MRI scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nausea","id":"nausea"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/powerless","id":"powerless"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/quality%20of%20life","id":"quality of life"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/severe%20pain","id":"severe pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/timescales","id":"timescales"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vomiting","id":"vomiting"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/impact","id":"impact"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medical%20knowledge","id":"medical knowledge"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/timeframe","id":"timeframe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/elective%20surgery","id":"elective surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20ill","id":"very ill"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1068081","id":"1068081"}]},{"id":1065859,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Appointment","body":"The appt was delayed, but the service as always was fantastic.

We had hoped that the letter would get her 'fast tracked' to x-ray but alas, that was not to be. We had a horrible long wait (ED was frantically busy and as fast as one patient got seen three more came in through the door) but they did their best to keep us informed. The delay was worth it - our friend was seen and thoroughly examined by an incredibly conscientious and kind physiotherapist who ran a number of tests after seeing her before sending her for the coveted x-rays. When the results were back the situation was carefully explained to us and they ensured that she would be all right before letting us all go home.

The GPs at all levels of seniority are wonderful, thorough and have always provided outstanding care to myself and my young family. The GPs are a credit to their profession.\n\nUnfortunately, the receptionists that must be dealt with before getting an appointment are a very mixed bag. \n\nSome receptionists at Street Lane are good listeners and deal with any queries efficently.\n\nOther receptionists (both in person or on the phone) don't listen well, talking over me with the same scripted answers. Asking them to go off-stript is met with frustration and at times anger. Things are no better when corresponding electronically if these same members of staff pick up the case - I have had countless messages not read properly with poor responses, requiring me to clog up the phone line to try and resolve their misunderstanding.\n\nIt's hard to tell if it's a training issue or something else, but the receptionist experience is too often a deeply frustrating experience at Street Lane. \n\nFrom witnessing patients in front of me in the queue being talked over, and speaking to friends who are also Street Lane patients, the poor experience with receptionists is a widespread issue. \n\nI hope more can be done to improve listening and provide a consistant patient-focussed service from the whole reception team.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2023-05-10T16:19:36","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-05-15T09:43:09","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1065855","id":"1065855"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1065855/responses","id":"1065855"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1065855/healthservices","id":"1065855"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1065855/tags","id":"1065855"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/b86066","id":"B86066","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anger","id":"anger"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frustrating","id":"frustrating"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/better","id":"better"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20good","id":"not good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hope","id":"Hope"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doing%20well","id":"doing well"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/no%20hope","id":"no hope"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20great","id":"not great"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1066253","id":"1066253"}]},{"id":1065854,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Efficient and effective responsive service ","body":"I had a telephone consultation on 19/8/22 to discuss some word finding difficulties I'd been experiencing over the previous week or so.

My GP Dr Griffin saw me within two hours, and was concerned enough to refer me immediately to A&E at the RAH Hospital in Paisley. She gave me a letter to deliver on arrival, and spoke on the phone to an orthopaedic doctor, Dr Henderson, at the hospital to make him aware of my symptoms. She also phoned me en route to update me about this development.  \r\nI was admitted swiftly to the Trauma Unit, where bloods were taken. The nursing staff who I engaged with could not have been friendlier, and they went to great lengths to explain how long the blood results would take, and that Dr Henderson would examine me in due course. This happened not long afterwards, and I was relieved to hear that treatment in the first instance would be oral antibiotics, and that an overnight stay to receive IV antibiotics was not deemed necessary. I had an x-ray taken, again extremely quickly, and I was discharged with prescribed medication a little over two hours after I had first spoken to my GP.  \r\nAll the health professionals I came in contact with yesterday really were tremendous ambassadors for the NHS. Everyone I spoke to was kind, empathetic and informative, and they reassured me when I found myself in a situation I hadn‚Äôt anticipated, which had raised my anxiety levels significantly. It was obvious to me that everyone, both at the surgery and at the hospital, is working extremely hard in very trying circumstances, but despite having so many demands placed upon them, everyone was totally focused on my welfare, and could not have been more helpful. I would like to express my gratitude for the level of service I received in both establishments yesterday, and to communicate to all the professionals I encountered that they have my utmost respect and admiration. Thank you for looking after me so well.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-05-12T12:21:28.4666667","progress":"Story has a

The followup physio and excercises ensured myknee attained the maximum bend. However not all NHS providers in Plymouth are as helpful . My neighbour had a total knee replacement on 5th May this year. She was discharged the day following the operation with medication but no ice cuff. Her wound has been glued and covered Una waterproof dressing but with instructions not to shower for 2weeks  When she rang her surgery for an appointment for the dressing to be changed in 10 daysan appointment was not available and she was told to go to A&E  .

I have found Asha and the services they have provided to me to be a real eye-opener emotionally and physically. The documentaries and education I received were brilliant. The staff made me feel at ease. They were very approachable and I felt confident to bring any problem I had to staff's attention.  \r\nI'd like to mention that the healthcare was very good, I was checked twice a day and nurses were thorough in checking my blood pressure and stats. I felt so looked after and safe in this environment.  \r\nI enjoyed the meditation sessions, yoga, relaxing music playing in the background of the ward very relaxing. I liked the daily walks and things people took for granted such as going to the local shop twice a week with staff. It was an excellent structured daily routine and the food was lovely. I was grateful to be in the unit with lovely fellow patients who I've really connected with and we shall remain friends after our stay.  \r\nFor anyone reading this and is referred to Asha, I hope I set your mind at ease. Before my admission I was scared and anxious, I didn't know what to expect. I was met on arrival by Tanya, Maria and Naomi (amazing people) I felt at ease straight away even though I was crying. They really made me feel safe and there was no judgement. I also want to say a big thank you to Jenna, Sean, Aidy and Malachy for their understanding and encouragement. It was really appreciated and all the student nurses, Caitlin and Jordon.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-05-12T15:23:02.67","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-05-15T12:01:28.857","readBy":[{"name":"Western Health and Social Care Trust","count":11}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1065043","id":"1065043"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1065043/responses","id":"1065043"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1065043/healthservices","id":"1065043"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1065043/tags","id":"1065043"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt005-asha","id":"zt005-asha","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxious","id":"anxious"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scared","id":"scared"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/alcohol","id":"alcohol"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/approachable","id":"approachable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20pressure","id":"blood pressure"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/brilliant","id":"brilliant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/education","id":"education"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emotional%20support","id":"emotional support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/encouragement","id":"encouragement"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/environment","id":"environment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/food","id":"food"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mindset","id":"mindset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/music","id":"music"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/physical%20health","id":"physical health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/positive","id":"positive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/relaxing","id":"relaxing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/routine","id":"routine"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/safe","id":"safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/structure","id":"structure"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/student%20nurses","id":"student nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/understanding","id":"understanding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unit","id":"unit"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ward","id":"ward"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/yoga","id":"yoga"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing","id":"amazing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appreciated","id":"appreciated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/recovery%20walks","id":"recovery walks"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/checks","id":"checks"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20ease","id":"at ease"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/belief","id":"belief"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emotional%20health","id":"emotional health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/improved%20self-esteem","id":"improved self-esteem"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wonderful%20people","id":"wonderful people"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/no%20judgement","id":"no judgement"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20well%20looked%20after%20and%20safe","id":"very well looked after and safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing%20health%20care","id":"amazing health care"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1068014","id":"1068014"}]},{"id":1065920,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Excellent Service","body":"I attendid the Imagining Department  for injections in the Ankle.

One very elderly lady adjacent to me was extremely upset as she‚Äôd no idea where her husband was. It took a volunteer lady to find out and take her to him, she‚Äôd been sitting there alone and anxious for hours not knowing where he was, nursing staff rushing past ignoring her. I appreciate it was busy but that doesn‚Äôt excuse the complete disregard and rudeness shown by most of the staff (apart from the doctors) I did after some hours see a doctor who told me to wait ‚Äòalong the corridor‚Äô whilst she wrote up her notes and my prescription which was urgent although pharmacy closed so I‚Äôd have to collect them on Monday! I waited and waited, nearly two hours later after repeated attempts to speak to staff in their meeting room a doctor came out with my prescription. (No idea where my doctor had gone) At one point a nurse rushed out of the staff room in tears, I know how she felt!

The Receptionist was extremely pleasant and helpful and respectful.  From the minute I entered the GP room I could feel the stress leaving my body.  He is beyond exceptional in his professional role.   He is a Senior Partner in the practice and he treated me in a very caring and kindly manner,  and removed all my anxieties and fears regarding my health issues immediately and talked to me in a very clear and simple manner regarding my ailments which allowed me to understand what the problem was, which turned out to be nothing to worry about.   A huge weight dropped off my mind and his manner of communicating and dealing with the situation was medicine in itself.   I left there feeling very humbled and grateful to have such an amazing GP and a lovely environment and I felt like a human being again instead of being a statistic in the Medical Profession.  I travelled outside my zone specifically to attend this surgery and to have my appointment dealt with by what I deem to be one of the best GPs in London. Not only did he allay my worries and concerns regarding my ailments which turned out to be trivial, he boosted my mental health well being and I returned home feeling very positive and ready to embrace the day.

I normally have this treatment at Glasgow's New Victoria Hospital, however my last procedure prior to today was given at Glasgow's Gartnavel Hospital and this procedure was delivered in a different, more rushed, manner which actually left me in pain and discomfort without receiving any targeted pain relief at all.  \r\nIt was with relief that when I received my appointment for today's procedure I noted it was back at the New Victoria Hospital.  \r\nToday I arrived right on the dot and had only sat down when a cheery nurse came out and introduced herself and guided me to the changing rooms with some gowns and some instructions. A few minutes later the nurse took me to the CT room where the procedure would be done. After being introduced to the other 2 nurses on the team I discovered that the procedure would be carried out by *Doctor Lam who had carried out my previous procedures at this hospital.  \r\nHe explained everything he'd be doing very clearly, took plenty of time targeting with the CT machine to ensure that the injections got to where they were needed and gave me as long a period of relief as possible.  \r\nSometimes it's only when you get a really contrasting experience, in my case at Gartnavel Hospital, that you realise how excellent the service you get and how professional the staff are. In this instance I want to thank Dr. Lan for the very welcome pain relief, and also Paula, Lindy and Martine for making this procedure comfortable, respectful and cheery.  \r\nThe reason I sought out this site and wrote this, is that for one reason and another it's usually the negative experiences which gets all the bandwidth and the column inches. Not in any way to diminish the stories from these people, which must be told, I think it's especially important to highlight and raise up our NHS staff, nurses, doctors and orderlies, who work at the coal face and who continue to strive for positive outcomes and deliver, in my case any way relief, day after day after day.  \r\nThank you.  \r\n*(? possibly spelt Lan)  \r\n[Very happy with 'Staff skills']  \r\n[Very happy with 'Staff attitude']  \r\n","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-05-12T16:03:59.1266667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-05-15T12:31:59.373","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":11}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1065054","id":"1065054"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1065054/responses","id":"1065054"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1065054/healthservices","id":"1065054"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1065054/tags","id":"1065054"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/g505h-xrays-and-scans","id":"g505h-xrays-and-scans","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/gartnaval-general-rheumatology","id":"gartnaval-general-rheumatology","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/new-victoria-hospital-rheu","id":"new-victoria-hospital-rheu","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/nvh-imaging","id":"nvh-imaging","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/attention%20to%20detail","id":"attention to detail"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cheery","id":"cheery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/chronic%20pain","id":"chronic pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ct","id":"ct"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/discomfort","id":"discomfort"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctor","id":"doctor"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/injections","id":"injections"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/introductions","id":"introductions"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/joint","id":"joint"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/joint%20pain","id":"joint pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurse","id":"nurse"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain%20relief","id":"pain relief"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/patient%20communication","id":"Patient communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/positive%20experience","id":"positive experience"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/relief","id":"relief"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/rushed","id":"rushed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/clear%20explanations","id":"clear explanations"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/comfortable","id":"comfortable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attitudes","id":"staff attitudes"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attention","id":"staff attention"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treated%20differently","id":"treated differently"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctors%20attention%20to%20detail","id":"doctors attention to detail"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1069225","id":"1069225"}]},{"id":1065950,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Midwife","body":"I‚Äôm on my second pregnancy and I never felt any sympathy from her, never answered on time to my phone calls or messages.

I can't remember a lot of names from this ward but Pam and all the staff who looked after me were amazing making sure myself and my partner were comfortable and fully understood every step of the process. After 3 days I was taken to the labor ward where things took a turn and I had to have an emergency section, this was absolutely terrifying to me and I really worried about my whole pregnancy particularly how I would be post section and recovery.  \r\nAfter our baby arrived we were moved to ward 50. From the minute I arrived in the ward still feeling strong effects from the spinal and unable to really look after my baby the midwife's, after care and even auxilliary staff were amazing in helping me so I could care for my baby while my husband had gone home to try get a sleep after a long night. I mainly had midwife Taylor look after my throughout stay who was great and reassured me so much ! but also a number of other midwife's. Nothing was too much and I've never been so well looked after! We ended up with a short stay at the intensive care unit which led us to stay in ward 50 for a total of 5 days while my baby received antibiotics for an infection and again amazing care from the nicu staff. The whole situation was exactly what I was desperate to avoid for having my baby but due to the staff , Taylor and Alison looking after us all it really was made so much easier and we couldn't be more grateful for everyone that we dealt with during our week in the hospital ! Thank you all so much.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-05-12T18:05:01.26","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-05-15T12:37:55.69","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":12}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1065074","id":"1065074"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1065074/responses","id":"1065074"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1065074/healthservices","id":"1065074"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1065074/tags","id":"1065074"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sj9-neoneonatalunit","id":"sj9-neoneonatalunit","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sj9qe-matcare1","id":"sj9qe-matcare1","score":5},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sj9qe-matcare3","id":"sj9qe-matcare3","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing%20staff","id":"amazing staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/antibiotics","id":"antibiotics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/infection","id":"infection"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/intensive%20care","id":"intensive care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/maternity","id":"maternity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/midwives","id":"midwives"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pregnancy","id":"pregnancy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pregnant","id":"pregnant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/section","id":"section"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/spinal","id":"spinal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supportive","id":"supportive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ward%20staff","id":"ward staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/well%20looked%20after","id":"well looked after"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassuring","id":"reassuring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/clear%20explanations","id":"clear explanations"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/neonatal%20staff","id":"neonatal staff"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1069069","id":"1069069"}]},{"id":1065076,"author":"Lollipop124","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Breast Screening Appointment","body":"I attended the breast screening clinic in Nelson Mandela Place.

I was a little anxious and worried, more about what they'll find than of the procedure. Being of a rather embarrassing nature I found the staff, nurses and doctors to be very calming and welcoming. Extremely professional and really helped me settle down and relax. The reception staff were excellent. The nurse doing the pre checks (Gillian I think), was very good. Talked to me in a very calming and compassionate way, very reassuring and polite when talking about sensitive issues.  \r\nI was taken to a room to change, everything was explained to me at every stage. I opted for gas and air instead of sedation.  \r\nAnother nurse, came and fetched me through to the operating room.  \r\nThey settled me on the bed and got me ready. The clinician who was performing the procedure talked to me and told me what was going to happen, that it could be very painful and the nurses will help me at any point.  \r\nThe procedure was painful and uncomfortable, I had a little gas and air and was OK.  \r\nAfterwards, it was told what had been found and what was going to happen next. This was very good as it didn't leave me worrying about the results. The clinician was very plain and direct about what she had found, for which I found it extremely helpful.  \r\nThe whole experience was excellent. Very professional, courteous, respectful and compassionate all the way through. At no point was I left feeling alone or lost about the procedure. A real credit to Chesterfield Royal Hospital.  \r\nThankyou all for your hard work and professionalism throughout.","criticality":"not
