You must ring at 08:15 or 14:00 and even then, appointments may all be gone by the time you get through. I’m particularly baffled as the receptionists still insist that you call at these times even when the surgery has contacted you to make an appointment regardless of the severity of the ongoing situation. Why they removed online booking is beyond me! That was a much simpler method of securing an appointment and could be booked in advance instead of the mad scramble to try and get in there before everyone else. I’ve had receptionists quiz me about my symptoms only to tell me to call back later. Not a good system at all. \n\nIt’s a shame because the GPs (when you get to see them) are very professional and obviously care about their patients.

Two hours passed the time I was supposed to be called and I still hadn't been contacted. I called MSI and was on hold for 40 minutes before I got through to someone. I was told when I eventually got through that they had tried to contact me but couldn't get through. My phone was on loud, I had signal and they definitely had the right number because they had got through successfully two days prior. I was then told all they could do was book me in for another two days time. I am now 8 weeks pregnant and incredibly distressed as it is impacting my mental health and daily life.
