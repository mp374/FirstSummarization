I had excellent care over the telephone recently. But then things seemed to fall apart. Firstly, there was no communication over an appointment I was due to have in March, which I'd booked 21 days in advance. I learnt through someone else on twitter that all appointments had been switched to telephone. I had no information from the practice and there was no information online. Furthermore, the ability to book appointments online was removed without any communication to patients, or information on the website. I couldn't change an appointment I already had booked without calling, at a practice where phone lines are unreliable and frequently going down. There may have been a good reason why this was removed, but removing it without informing patients seems remiss. Newsletters with no helpful information are occasionally sent out, but when it comes to things patients actually want to know - like getting rid of 72 hour appointments, introducing 21 day appointments, doctors leaving, online bookings being disabled - we hear nothing. \nThen, I was informed by text in early May that I should be shielding due to the covid pandemic. Since then I have heard nothing. I still haven't received a letter that would be helpful when making arrangements with my employer. I assume I was identified as vulnerable by my GP as I was not picked up earlier in the first 'wave' of shielding. So a phone call would have been appreciated - didn't need to be immediately, but eventually. This is life-changing advice. Out of the blue, with no time to prepare, I was told I should not leave my home until the end of June, living with complex health problems, and that's all I heard. Disappointed.

I write this post not as a complaint as I understand the reason for restricting visiting during COVID but to give a little insight into how it feels to be separated from your critically ill child. A child has two parents who want to spend every moment with them especially since they don’t know if their child will see tomorrow! So only allowing one parent in at a time breaks the family unit and the support system. The support both parents provide for each other is vital in trying to stay afloat in this horrific situation! I have to sit in the car as there is no where else I am allowed to go. I sit here anxious and nervous as I feel so far away from my child and husband.  \r\nI sit here alone trying to process what the next hour has in store for us! I plan how long it would take me to get to the PICU from the car park in an emergency! If an emergency happened would I make it in time? As I sit here alone I have no one to reassure me that’s it’s going to be ok. COVID is not going away any time soon! Children becoming sick still happens during COVID so I feel that the Scottish government and the health board need to realise and have a better understanding of the trauma being separated from your sick child causes and review the rules! Come and spend some time with me in the unit and perhaps gain a bit of insight!

I had tried rehab twice overseas and was still struggling. It had resulted in the loss of my marriage, my family unit, my job and the life I loved so much. I was very ill, both mentally and physically. I was at a very low point in my life and couldn’t see how any support or treatment could work. I was left feeling hopeless and lost.  \r\nI immediately began seeking all the care and support services I could. Through the GP I was able to get physically assessed and admitted and was treated brilliantly to restore me back to full health. I contacted CGL and the Wellbeing services, both who provided me with ongoing support and guidance. I was treated as a human with an illness, not with disdain or disgust which meant a huge deal to me at the time following my fall from grace. Thankfully, with their support and on going relentless positivity I am now nearly 8 months sober, a previously unthinkable achievement.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-05-30T09:07:07.44","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-06-01T14:51:17.947","readBy":[{"name":"Change Grow Live","count":4}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/770639","id":"770639"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/770639/responses","id":"770639"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/770639/healthservices","id":"770639"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/770639/tags","id":"770639"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/nms-norfolk-alcohol-and-drug-behaviour-change","id":"nms-norfolk-alcohol-and-drug-behaviour-change","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rmy_721","id":"RMY_721","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/addiction","id":"addiction"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/alcoholism","id":"alcoholism"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/determination","id":"determination"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/guidance","id":"guidance"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helped","id":"helped"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hopeful","id":"hopeful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/positivity","id":"Positivity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/loved","id":"loved"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/770820","id":"770820"}]},{"id":770768,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Prompt and very friendly response.","body":"I really like the online consultation followed by a telephone call then an appointment if required.

The nurse who rang me i am unsure of her name, was extremely rude, didn't seem to understand that I was explaining my symptoms and how they were not related to a medical condition I have (I work for a private ambulance service so have indepth knowledge regarding such conditions) she didn't seem to take me concern seriously and told he she can't do anything, she quizzed me as to why my condition was urgent while continuing to speak to me in an unprofessional Manor. She laughed at me when I tried to explain that I was unable to get to A&E and would rather not attend in an ambulance. Having explained that I had previously been to the doctors with this as I had been struggling and it has got worse today, I told her I couldn't get an appointment and it felt like someone was kneeling on my chest, I could take deep breath in but feel like I cant breathe out. She didn't seem to care and was still speaking to me like im an uneducated toddler. The conclusion to this was that I will never use the walk in clinic again and have lost faith in the service providers employed there. The receptionist at the time was really lovely and seemed to genuinely try and help while asking questions. I got laughed at for the way in which I use my inhalers and despite explaining to her that it is not asthma like symptoms and they had no effect she was still adamant i was fine.

I dont mean to criticise the service as I understand it is a challenging profession as I work in the same type of condition, but no matter what no one who is concerned about their health, let alone having a respiratory issue should be dismissed and laughed at regardless of their circumstances.

Spent 9 days in a coma after my wife was told I was critical and not sure if I would pull through. When I came round I had no idea what I had experienced, relying on the fantastic Doctors and Nurses who cared for me.I was quite delusional for the first few days and very emotional and could not stop crying over the littlest of things. Everyone was absolutely fantastic with me and when I managed to get my speech back, I had great conversations with all the nurses. I was then transferred to Ward 23 and special thanks to Adele Kirsty and Hayleigh, who could not do enough for me to make my stay in the ward as easy as possible. Unfortunately I ended up with a chest and UTI and had to spend a few extra days in the ward. Missing my family when I felt I was ready to go home. I would explain my after effects as complete fatigue, all my bones are sore and I believe this can last for weeks. I am lucky that I had some form of mobility, but still need to exercise as I feel quite often unstable in my balance. Will be a long road to recovery but taking each day as it comes will help. Mental anguish could be another issue, at one point during my return to my home, I was frightened to get to sleep and ended up putting the light in for comfort. Thankfully that only lasted for a couple of days. I know I am one of the fortunate ones, but without the care and dedication of the ICU staff, I would not be able to tell my tale. My only concern is, I have no one else to speak with who has experienced what I have went through and feel it would be great, if there was some form of contact, that I can speak with but they are just as unaware of best practice due to this new virus.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-05-29T12:38:08.42","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-06-02T08:51:17.277","readBy":[{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2021)","count":1},{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":15},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/770562","id":"770562"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/770562/responses","id":"770562"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/770562/healthservices","id":"770562"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/770562/tags","id":"770562"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/c418h-critical-care","id":"c418h-critical-care","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frightened","id":"frightened"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20about","id":"Cared about"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dedication","id":"dedication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctor","id":"doctor"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/the%20food","id":"the food"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20for","id":"cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fantastic","id":"fantastic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/follow%20up%20support","id":"follow up support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thanks","id":"thanks"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid-19","id":"covid-19"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good%20company","id":"good company"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/771845","id":"771845"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/771870","id":"771870"}]},{"id":770585,"author":"avon71","authorRoleId":1,"authorRole":"a carer","title":"Care, compassion and patience","body":"Everyone who has visited from IRIS has shown care, compassion and patience.

He was admitted for an overnight stay that turned out to be for 6 days. We managed that bit with the help of my niece in lockdown. I was satisfied with his treatment. The huge problem I had was not knowing things at home on my own (with my sister in a care home with a severe chest infection alongside; I am not considered to be next of kin for her as she has family, so cannot even get information if I phone about her. ). With Crosshouse, my husband had forgotten his phone charger. We had to pace calls now and again, during which he had speech difficulties occasionally. One time a nurse helped by lending her charger (Thanks! That just lifted the constant fear for a while: bless you! ). I tried to phone the ward once and after waiting 45 minutes with the very considerate telephone operator, got through only to hear the ward sounds and my call be hung up as soon as I started to say hello! I was furious and just completely broke down. On his last day my husband found that he could have made calls to me or me to him by a phone on the ward attached to a tv, even without charge, but the money would never have been an issue, Nobody bothered to tell him. They had no idea what I was going through alone over a hundred miles from family and being housebound due to lockdown.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-05-29T17:46:09.68","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-06-02T09:14:42.75","readBy":[{"name":"NHS 24","count":22},{"name":"NHS Ayrshire & Arran","count":8},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/770587","id":"770587"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/770587/responses","id":"770587"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/770587/healthservices","id":"770587"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/770587/tags","id":"770587"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/a111h_107","id":"A111H_107","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/nhs24-111","id":"NHS24-111","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/furious","id":"furious"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/isolated","id":"isolated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scared","id":"scared"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/alone","id":"alone"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20tests","id":"blood tests"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/chest","id":"chest"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/chest%20infection","id":"chest infection"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ecg","id":"ecg"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/family%20contact","id":"Family contact"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/forgotten","id":"forgotten"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/housebound","id":"housebound"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/infection","id":"infection"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/information","id":"information"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurse","id":"nurse"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/operator","id":"Operator"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/speech","id":"speech"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/telephone%20access","id":"telephone access"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tia","id":"tia"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting","id":"waiting"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/770826","id":"770826"}]},{"id":770599,"author":"John Doe 57","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Addiction and bereavement","body":"I had a long addiction to alcohol.

I understand that the recent pandemic has made things very different but I am now being told there is NO support available from this service. Instead they advised me via the Feedback service to speak to a neuropsychologist. The neuropsychologist told me to speak to liaison psychiatry. So what should I do? In the meantime I have lost my ability to deal with my own finances, and have twice been told this week that doctors spoke to me of which I have absolutely no memory. So any advice, treatment plans I just have no means of accessing because people refuse to give me the help I need. Today I set the grill on fire and only found it by seeing smoke from under the kitchen door. I'm trying desperately to help myself but knowing these people don't seem to care is very difficult. If anybody out there knows what else there is available instead of the seemingly defunct Liaison Psychiatry service then I'd be grateful to hear about it.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-05-29T19:23:51.6366667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-06-02T09:42:15.667","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Grampian","count":5},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/770600","id":"770600"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/770600/responses","id":"770600"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/770600/healthservices","id":"770600"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/770600/tags","id":"770600"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/n198h-liaison-psychiatry","id":"N198H-liaison-psychiatry","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20upset","id":"very upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dismayed","id":"dismayed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/duty%20of%20care","id":"duty of care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/liaison%20psychiatry","id":"liaison psychiatry"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/memory","id":"memory"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/service%20availability","id":"service availability"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/770903","id":"770903"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/770927","id":"770927"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/770980","id":"770980"}]},{"id":770830,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Endoscopy unit","body":"On 11/05/2020  I attended the unit for endoscopy.

I have seen many NHS Trust staff smoke throughout the hospital grounds without any challenge from security staff or other hospital staff, despite the hospital claiming it has a \"STRICT no smoking policy\"(??)  \r\nThere is NOTHING \"strict\" about this hospital with regards to no-smoking on site. I wish they'd just do away with the signage if they can't keep staff in check or have no desire to honour their own 'no-smoking' policy. Many of the staff smoke outside the main entrance of the hospital in full view of others; they also smoke outside the A&E department; they also smoke opposite the mortuary, and they also smoke on the left-side grass embankment at the road entrance to the hospital in full view of drivers and passers by.  \r\nWhat sort of message does this send to members of the public or to people who might potentially want to work at the hospital? Why should vulnerable patients such as asthmatics, COPD patients, patients with heart conditions, cystic fibrosis etc. be put at risk?  \r\nI think they should, as a hospital, do the same as other hospitals and organisations and put tannoys up around the hospital requesting people not to smoke in designated areas? At least be shown to be trying to make a difference. Also, why not have security cameras set up in 'smoking hotspots' to deter employees from smoking and to identify those who require support.  \r\nHow is this country ever going to be 'Smokefree' by 2030 if even health organisations can't get actively on board?","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-05-31T10:43:51.0066667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-06-02T10:49:48.437","readBy":[{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2020)","count":2},{"name":"Royal Devon University Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust (2)","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/770674","id":"770674"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/770674/responses","id":"770674"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/770674/healthservices","id":"770674"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/770674/tags","id":"770674"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rh801","id":"RH801","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disappointed","id":"disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/copd","id":"copd"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cystic%20fibrosis","id":"cystic fibrosis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/heart","id":"heart"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/smoking","id":"smoking"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/smoking%20cessation","id":"smoking cessation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attitude","id":"staff attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/signs%20ignored","id":"signs ignored"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/771325","id":"771325"}]},{"id":770651,"author":"lionwr88","authorRoleId":11,"authorRole":"other","title":"My therapy","body":"When it happened a story for my life.He lied to me and used me for prostitution 😥  \r\nI was very bad while now I am better because I can share protected where I stay and the therapy.

On arrival we realised there may be issues with restricted visiting etc which we accepted. We were allowed onto the ward where the doctor had notes regarding her shared care plan and her other exceptional circumstances including severe mental health. Doctors and nurse were both made aware and I was able to stay with her during the initial consultation but told I would not be able to go on the ward. We asked to go home to get a few things and get mum prepared for her stay which we did on the return the rules changed and I was able to settle her on the ward which with her personal situation was very much appreciated. Morning came and I was asked by the nurse to bring mums medication which I did. This time I was not able to get passed the door, again I understood as I was only dropping items off. As a type 1 diabetic the patient had to be kept as nil by mouth so my mother had nothing to eat from around 2.30am and that was items I had provided. Through regular phone calls with her at 1.30pm when she still had not had her procedure I asked to speak to the nurse. The nurse taking care of my mum was more concerned with why I was on site for my mother's well being than why she had not had the procedure. I was made aware by some of the previous days nurses that they were waiting for the Covid test - something that had not been communicated with my mother. Explaining the situations and all my mothers medical issues the nurse dismissed me and stated I would need to vacate the area and call up to find out about my mother. I did as asked and made contact by phone. I was then told there was no change and I would need to call at 4pm.  \r\nThrough regular contact with my mother she asked if I could charge her phone and she began to worry about the fact she had been given a menu for later as well as the next day which had made her anxious and she began stating she would stay. To calm her I agreed to come and collect her phone from reception on the ward as well as the menu to complete for her. On approaching the ward a nurse allowed me in which I asked several times as previously I had been told this would not be possible the nurse lead me to my mother and I calmed only to have the nurse taking care of my mother again inform me that this was incorrect and no one else had visitors and I would have to leave. Understandably confused as I had informed the member of staff about the situation. I asked about the mitigating circumstances that would possibly let allow me to be with my mother and was told it only covered palliative patients. I asked at reception if there was a list of mitigating circumstances and was informed they were unaware of any but PALS may be able to help. As I have to return the phone to my mother I have been informed by the nurse that I will need to go to the main reception and leave personal effects there for them to be collect by the nurses. I asked at reception and was told this was not the case. This whole situation has left my mother and my family very disappointed for the first time using the QE. My mother has many procedures on the horizon that will require lengthy stays and this will affect her beyond this interaction and her mental state going forward.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-05-30T15:24:09.4","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-06-02T11:25:27.527","readBy":[{"name":"Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust","count":2},{"name":"Sheffield University Medical School 2020","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/770659","id":"770659"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/770659/responses","id":"770659"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/770659/healthservices","id":"770659"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/770659/tags","id":"770659"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rwp50_300","id":"RWP50_300","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxious","id":"anxious"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confused","id":"confused"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disappointed","id":"disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/admission","id":"admission"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care%20plan","id":"care plan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confusing","id":"confusing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/consistency","id":"consistency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diabetic","id":"diabetic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dismissed","id":"dismissed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unclear%20instructions","id":"unclear instructions"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dismissive%20staff","id":"dismissive staff"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/771305","id":"771305"}]},{"id":770660,"author":"firewm94","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Quick GP referral","body":"Last week I was struggling with pain and moving my bowels, after trying to move them I realised I was bleeding from my back passage and the pain was increasing. I decided to call my GP's surgery and ask them to make a note on my file, they have been investigating dietary issues for a while with me.  \r\nWhen I called in, there was a recorded message on how to order your repeated prescription now and what to do if you have suspected covid19 symptoms. There was also information on only being offered a face-to-face appointment if deemed necessary by the GP after a phone appointment.  \r\nOnce through the receptionist asked what the appointment would be in regards to, I said dietary issues. She informed me the Doctor would call back within the hour, and they did.  \r\nI explained my symptoms to the GP and she asked some routine questions. She asked if it was possible for me to come to the surgery, I was surprised as I hadn't expected to be seen in person. I was asked to wear a mask and gloves before arriving, and to ring the bell and step back from the main door. The receptionist checked my name and who I was to see and asked me to wait at the side door.  \r\nThe GP opened the side door, she was wearing full PPE, gloves, mask, apron and a face screen protector. I was taken in to the examination room, it was very clean and had no extra equipment, just the desk, a chair and the examination table.  \r\nThe Doctor asked me some questions and then asked to do a physical examination, it was a very routine appointment apart from the PPE we were both wearing. She was able to take my blood pressure while I wore the gloves, I have honestly never felt safer in the surgery.  \r\nShe left to make a call, to a Doctor at the QUEH and they wanted see me as soon as possible. I was really shocked and seriously struggling to believe her, but she gave me a note of where to go and who to ask for. She checked I had more gloves and masks to wear while attending and explained that there was a completely separate entrance for non covid19 patients.  \r\nI went home and fed my dog then went straight to the hospital, driven by my husband. Most of you will know getting to the QEUH can be a challenge, it was 5 o'clock and we made it in 20 mins from the Hampden area of Glasgow.  \r\nThe hospital was so quiet, it was kind of eerie, I've never noticed what an imposing site it is when it's not busy. Husband dropped me at the drop off section and I went in alone. It had been explained I couldn't take anyone with me as waiting areas were observing social distancing rules.  \r\nThe non covid19 entrance was very clearly marked and I met 2 people who checked why I was there and that I wasn't experiencing any Covid19 related symptoms. There were markings on the floor like at the supermarket to keep you 2 meters from the next person. The revolving doors are wedged open so you don't have to crowd in or touch anything. There is hand sanitizer at the door for anyone to use.  \r\nI asked the main receptionist from the taped off area for directions and want straight through to the department. The door was locked so I had to push a buzzer and wait to be admitted. Again met by a nurse wearing full PPE who checked my details and asked me to wait in the seating area. There were 3 other people waiting and every 2nd chaired was marked not to be sat on. You never try to sit close to someone in the Doctors or hospital waiting room but this felt weird. We were actively trying to stay as far apart as possible. It was very effective, no one was any closer than 10ft with the chairs and marked areas to direct travel.  \r\nI took a book to read and it helped to pass the time before and after my initial intake examination. Both the intake nurse and the assistant she had were dressed in full PPE, while taking blood and having internal exams. I honestly don't know why that isn't what they always use. It made me feel so much more comfortable in general about the spread of germs, I am very aware of the ease of transmission in simple things like colds and this was such a sterile feeling situation. I normally experience stress in these situations due to the high volume of people the hospital surgeries see, this visit was a completely different experiences  \r\nWhen I was seen by the Doctor they again wore full PPE during the consultation and I kept my mask on, I was able to take my gloves off once I was in the room. She was able to examine me fully with out any concerns about transmission of anything.  \r\nIt was very reassuring to know they were all well catered for in the forms of PPE, from the GP's receptionist right they way through to the hospital on call Doctor. The instructions given to me were very clear and what I was told matched what I experienced.  \r\nWhile I wasn't expecting to go to hospital I'm glad I did, I'm glad the Doctor had time to see me and so quickly. I'm really glad she did, me and my bum are on the mend. I'm scheduled for more tests and unless I experience a big change in symptoms ill get them when normal services return.  \r\nI wanted to let anyone out there who is putting off speaking to their GP about new or increased symptoms - don't!  \r\nThey want to see you, they want to help and so do the hospital staff. It is frightening to go to hospital at any time, it's especially frightening during the covid19 outbreak, but it is being done safely, for staff and patients. They all understand long term health conditions haven't stopped because of covid19.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-05-30T16:07:16.34","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-06-02T11:38:58.19","readBy":[{"name":"St. Andrews University ScotGEM Medical Students","count":1},{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":4},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/770660","id":"770660"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/770660/responses","id":"770660"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/770660/healthservices","id":"770660"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/770660/tags","id":"770660"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sj9-general-practices","id":"sj9-general-practices","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sj9qe-300","id":"sj9qe-300","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back%20passage","id":"back passage"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bleeding","id":"bleeding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bowels","id":"bowels"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cleanliness","id":"cleanliness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helped","id":"helped"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/safe","id":"safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thankful","id":"Thankful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20ease","id":"at ease"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/quick%20referral","id":"quick referral"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/clear%20instructions","id":"clear instructions"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/social%20distancing","id":"social distancing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ppe","id":"ppe"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/770895","id":"770895"}]},{"id":770849,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Miserable bunch","body":"Just dropped by to deliver our midwife letter.

The reception staff have always been very polite and helpful, especially during the lockdown, one receptionist went more than the proverbial mile sorting out a prescription for me.  The nursing staff have also been very helpful and friendly in helping me manage COPD and taking blood tests.  The three GPs I have seen have been marvellous, taking time to listen and making sure they understand my concerns and have been very conscientious in arranging for further hospital tests to be carried out. They have also looked at my medication and suggested I cut down on one which has made my \"restless legs\" a lot easier. It has been very difficult in lockdown but it has been made easier by the contacts this practice has made, making me feel that I am well looked after.
