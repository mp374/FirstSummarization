I asked could I leave as the staff member was so rude and making me very anxious and upset and they said yes and continued to add that they could very easily have turned me away.  \r\nAfter I'd left the surgery my arm started to bleed and I had a large lump afterwards and have badly bruised for a week now.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-02-17T14:59:18.0033333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-07-25T09:20:00.16","readBy":[{"name":"Northern Health and Social Care Trust","count":12},{"name":"Public Health Agency","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/917440","id":"917440"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/917440/responses","id":"917440"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/917440/healthservices","id":"917440"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/917440/tags","id":"917440"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt002-east-antrim-treatment-rooms","id":"zt002-east-antrim-treatment-rooms","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20upset","id":"very upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/advice","id":"advice"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20tests","id":"blood tests"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attitude","id":"staff attitude"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/959794","id":"959794"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/960057","id":"960057"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/961365","id":"961365"}]},{"id":956433,"author":"silverwaredg74","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Great service from leg ulcer clinic","body":"At last I have finally been treated for my leg ulcer, after trying to get a face to face appointment with one of the GPs at my GP practice since Christmas time. The new young doctors are pleasant enough and were willing to see me but trying to get to see a GP has been impossible. I get asked to send in photo but no face to face appointment offered.  \r\nThe nurses and receptionists and chemist attached are great and eventually after 6 months the nurses referred me to the leg ulcer clinic at Bideford Hospital.  \r\nThe high quality of care from staff at the leg ulcer clinic have been wonderful. The clinic is very 'old school' and reminds me of how care and the NHS used to be. The nurses and staff in charge are lovely even the receptionist and the cleaner are fantastic.  \r\nI truly hope we don't lose this clinic from Bideford like we did with the A&E. Living in a tourist location can get very busy in services during peak times of the year and we need these smaller services.  \r\nI feel that if I had been seen by one of the GPs from the beginning it would not have got as bad as it did.

I understand some people may be hypochondriacs and be paranoid about what they have however I know my body and this has happened before whereby no one would take me seriously until I received an official diagnosis despite I had been saying for months I had what I was eventually diagnosed with.  \r\nThe nurse and doctor who saw me don’t know me and I know when something isn’t right and the medication I actually took as advised by the nurse on the telephone appointment treated the problem I think I have so I’m clearly right in saying I have this problem.

Why am I paying taxes for a health service that is apparently underfunded and cannot help me?","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-07-21T17:56:01.67","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-07-25T09:20:04.62","readBy":[{"name":"Healthwatch Sheffield","count":1},{"name":"Sheffield Health and Social Care NHS Foundation Trust","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/958653","id":"958653"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/958653/responses","id":"958653"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/958653/healthservices","id":"958653"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/958653/tags","id":"958653"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/tah-iapt","id":"TAH-iapt","score":1},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/tah-spa","id":"TAH-spa","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lack%20of%20care","id":"Lack of care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/access%20to%20services","id":"access to services"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gp%20attitude","id":"GP attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unhelpful","id":"unhelpful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting%20lists","id":"waiting lists"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/like%20i%20didn't%20matter","id":"like I didn't matter"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20treated","id":"not treated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lack%20of%20professionalism","id":"lack of professionalism"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/expert%20help","id":"expert help"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/964884","id":"964884"}]},{"id":958725,"author":"GN Belfast","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Emergency department visit felt grim","body":"After recent phone/online consultations and advice from GP and other assorted 'health professionals', plus some in-person in recent weeks, I was finally persuaded and agreed to go Ulster Hospital ED/A&E due to severe pain and other symptoms hardly-shifted by prescribed painkillers and steadily worsening in intensity recently.  \r\nI limped-in, attendant on door directed me to a hand-sanitiser which didn't work the best; then to get booked-in, which was OK and, while busy, there were plenty of spare seats. I sat down, and triage nurse called me within 30 minutes, she was grand, and said I'd need blood tests, health assistant called me after about another 45 minutes, she was grand too. I anticipated a long, painful wait, so read bits and pieces and just observed the screens and goings-on around me - as you do.  \r\nI noticed how many assorted posters and notices there were about the place, often on A4 and not easy to read - including one for this website, which I noted - and some telling people 'no relatives allowed', which was/is understandable.  \r\nHowever, the longer I was there, the longer I realised that the practical impact of that was that there were very obviously a number of variously vulnerable people waiting in the reception area, some appearing lost and bewildered, and in some cases visibly quite distressed, with no one seemingly doing anything about it, and this grew worse as time went on. It was also clear that such people had little or no way of knowing if doctors called their names inaudibly from a distance.  \r\nIn warm summer weather, a drinks machine which many - most? - trying to use it seemed to be unsuccessful, feels inadequate when a simple drinking water font would seem like a basic provision for sick/injured people - even more with relatives/friends deterred. Dehydration risk surely?  \r\nAs time went on, there was a feeling of a basically disorganised set-up with no one in charge and loads of people milling about, including more and more ambulance people and paramedics, and sick/old people looking very forlorn and lost. I felt so sorry for them but, apart from offering seats, I and others could not help. I don't think I saw a porter or anyone doing any portering over the several hours.  \r\nOn the screen, I'd also noticed that 'ambulance arrivals in past hour' were now at Zero. I don't know if that was a good or a bad thing?  \r\nThankfully, as I'd not eaten and avoided liquids, as abdominal pain on urinating was one of my symptoms, and I'd not done so since waking that day, plus wanted to be able to urinate if any sample needed later by a doctor, I did not use a toilet but couldn't avoid hearing lots of grumbles about same.  \r\nMy eventual liaison with a doctor was a rapid-fire series of questions where I had to ask if I could be allowed time to actually answer them - including toilet problems, notably saying I'd not urinated since getting-up that day - which I don't think went down too well, and cursory exam, with instruction to insist on seeing my GP in person, an instruction which was repeated when I asked the doctor how to do that as a just a patient, which was met by something to the effect of 'do you know the way out OK?'.  \r\nThat treatment area was actually quiet, unlike the waiting area, which was very busy as I gingerly exited and gently sat down on a step outside.  \r\nAll in all, the experience was grim. I really feel for hard-working, hard-pressed nurses, assistants and junior doctors doing their best in such an environment, but also wondered if any actually complain or don't just organise and tell management they're not putting up with it anymore? Who manages the place outside of the clinical area?  \r\nBut I felt and feel most sorry for those vulnerable people left to their fate in such an environment with no one to speak up for them. It's beyond cruel.  \r\nPS: whatever happened to the modern, roomy new ED/A&E in the shiny new-build?","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-07-21T22:21:33.3066667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-07-25T09:20:04.82","readBy":[{"name":"South Eastern Health and Social Care Trust","count":6},{"name":"Ulster University, MBBS (Medicine) 2021","count":1},{"name":"Public Health Agency","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/958725","id":"958725"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/958725/responses","id":"958725"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/958725/healthservices","id":"958725"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/958725/tags","id":"958725"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt004_07021_180","id":"ZT004_07021_180","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/abdominal","id":"abdominal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/above%20and%20beyond","id":"above and beyond"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20tests","id":"blood tests"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dehydration","id":"dehydration"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dismissive","id":"dismissive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disorganised","id":"disorganised"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/drinking","id":"drinking"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/drinking%20water","id":"drinking water"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency","id":"emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fearful","id":"fearful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/overcrowded","id":"overcrowded"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/painkillers","id":"painkillers"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/severe%20pain","id":"severe pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sorry","id":"sorry"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/triage","id":"triage"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting%20area","id":"waiting area"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/conveyor%20belt","id":"conveyor belt"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bloods%20taken","id":"bloods taken"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/inadequate%20care","id":"inadequate care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/antiquated","id":"antiquated"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/959719","id":"959719"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/959785","id":"959785"}]},{"id":958708,"author":"Dsapatient","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"The journey to terminal cancer","body":"I have suffered from COPD for perhaps four years, this May I was invited to the COPD clinic for the annual review. I had been suffering from headaches and a back pain. My doctor was called about the results and I was informed should the pains I was experiencing in my back return, I was advised to take myself to A & E or even call an ambulance. Appointments would be arranged for me at the Cardiac and Urology departments.  \r\nIn mid June my daughter arrived at my home and within a couple of hours I found myself in The Victoria Hospital Kirkcaldy A & E, quite a long queue but it seemed to be reducing quite quickly. Triage nurse was very efficient and had me checked out recorded and passed to the doctor. In the Admissions department I had X-ray, ECG, the usual BP, oxygen and pulse repeatedly and informed that was being admitted. Must be something wrong, this COPD has gotten serious. Soon enough I was in an admissions ward for the night, thank goodness the reports on the Telly about waiting around in corridors was false at least here in Kirkcaldy.  \r\nA couple of days in Admissions and another trip to the X-ray and MRI department to have a scan with contrast, then I was informed a move was imminent and a bed was becoming vacant in ward 23. Oops this is a Cardiologist ward. I was duly visited by several doctors all curious about my reason for self medication of oxygen I had acquired online to help my COPD, it helps a bit with energy loss. Anyway the outcome is I should be in ward 43 the Respiratory ward. Dr Fairbairn had me brought up to ward 43 to the treatment room where his magic pen produced a porridge like substance in three containers from my back which he would send away for analysis, the results would be back in a few days and in the meantime I would return to ward 23. I was in the wrong place as my ECG results indicated that my heart was strong and in ok condition. This is despite having an MI (myocardial infarction) some 30 years ago.  \r\nRegrettably it was time to leave this ward who have I must admit have been great, nurses and doctor’s alike I’ve been promoted up to respiratory Ward 43. Another X-ray and Scan with contrast.  \r\nThe following day I meet Dr Lee who will be going to fit a drain in the plura which is a sack around the left lung in my case. He will also put a tube with a camera with the facility of retrieving biopsy’s in the area. He will stitch up the hole but leave drain tube, I could be on medication and oxygen for sometime. Fine I thought no problem there.  \r\nNext day the porter arrived and to take me to the operations waiting area a nurse referred the area as the recovery room. The team with Dr Lee consisted of two others plus an observer a young man from Ward 43.  \r\nI remember some tapping going on on my back then nothing more. Apparently I was in there an hour but it didn’t seem like that and I was quite tired when I got back to the ward. I was receiving pain killers in the form of paracetamol and alternately oral morphine seemed a good idea but I had no pain, with that the morphine stopped, these medical people know what’s required.  \r\nI had now been in hospital for 9 days and was feeling much better. Along the way I had received an additional medication to reduce the swelling in my ankles which was referred as water retention, this medication causes one to go to the toilet quite a lot in the afternoon. So now I know the heart is good no need for trip to Cardiology and the water retention medication is working wonders with the urine so no need for a trip to the Urologists. Just a case of getting this fluid out of the plura and perhaps that’s the COPD also taken care of.  \r\nOn the 10th day I have the drainage removed from the operation and the pipe remains for the district nurses to take over draining this Plura. A meeting has been arranged before I am discharged with Dr Fairbairn and clinical nurse specialist Ed.  \r\nAt this point I am about to find out what’s the results of the analysis on that porridge Dr Fairbairn removed some days ago.  \r\nNot good news the reported results that the material is untreatable cancer cells. No treatment from either radiotherapy or chemotherapy, there would be a possibility of immunotherapy dependent on the report on the biopsy’s taken earlier but most likely the results have got to be greater than 50/50  \r\nWell so much for my worries about COPD.  \r\nMy Doctor assured me I had a clear X-ray 18 months ago.  \r\nThere you have it my journey from COPD and a breathing problem to being told I have an untreatable cancer and an estimated prognosis of 7 months. All in the short space of 10 days.  \r\nIn this 10 days I must say I have met with some outstanding people in the NHS, the A & E departments, the Admissions doctors and nurses, ward 23 where I was made welcome and looked after, Ward 43 with their Efficient nursing staff and Doctors including Dr Fairbairn and Dr Lee. Now my appreciation goes to the lovely young ladies from the district nurses office in Rosyth, Audrey. Amy, Emily & Karen, so efficient and smart.  \r\nTrust the process these people are professional even to the settling down again at home, my doctors surgery informed, the DWP informed and benefits arranged, oxygen supply arranged, and Ed is available to relieve any fears or worries.  \r\nThank you and God bless.","criticality":"not

I felt safe and calm in the room and the midwives brought tea and toast. My birth plan was read and followed as far as was possible, with midwives guiding me on interventions and pain relief as well as being very encouraging when I hit a few really difficult and low points. However I was in labour for a very long time and as a result I ended up with a forceps delivery, which was my worst nightmare before I went into labour, and at the time I was so frightened.  \r\nThe critical thing for me, that helped what could have been a really traumatic birth be actually fine was the staff. At all times I felt respected, listened to and cared for, in particular by my two midwives (shift change!). The doctor who finally delivered my son was also incredible. We had a follow up appointment a few weeks later with him where he explained what had happened and why which also made a huge difference to how I felt about the birth.  \r\nOn the ward after the birth all the staff were again lovely, patient and helpful, but I’ll be honest, I think they were short staffed and were not always available when needed for example in the night. I think more staff to help with simple tasks such as passing the baby for women who couldn’t get out of bed, bringing tea and water, and showing how to do basics like change nappies would have made a big difference and keeps midwives a bit freer to help with things like breastfeeding or medical concerns.  \r\nOverall I think I had a very positive experience in difficult circumstances, especially as covid restrictions were in place again at the time. I know the NHS is under huge pressure but I am hugely grateful to those who delivered my son for their kindness and professionalism.","criticality":"mildly

He is known to suffer with diagnosed mental health issues, these issues sadly brought him to overdose as an attempt to commit suicide, stating the voices in his head were getting too much and was actively asking for help. We thought this would finally be the first step in him getting help. I explained everything to the doctor in A&E at the time, my phone number was given and I was advised I would be told of any updates.  \r\nThe following day, I arrived at 12:00pm to be told that my father had been discharged an hour earlier with a bus pass to get home.  \r\nMy father had nothing on him apart from the clothes on his back and slippers on his feet. He did not have the keys to his home, any way to contact family, any money on him or even a proper pair of shoes on his feet. Aware that he was mentally unstable and still in a state of wanting to commit suicide, I asked why the department thought this was acceptable just to be told that they are sorry.  \r\nIs this normal protocol from the NHS? I am appalled and disgusted at how my father has been abandoned in a time of need.","criticality":"strongly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-07-22T13:59:22.33","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-07-25T11:42:04.447","readBy":[{"name":"Fife Health & Social Care Partnership","count":2},{"name":"NHS Fife","count":8},{"name":"Scottish Recovery Network","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/959076","id":"959076"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/959076/responses","id":"959076"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/959076/healthservices","id":"959076"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/959076/tags","id":"959076"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/f704h_180","id":"F704H_180","score":1},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appalled","id":"appalled"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disappointed","id":"disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disgusted","id":"disgusted"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/discharge","id":"discharge"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency","id":"emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/holistic%20care","id":"Holistic Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health%20awareness","id":"Mental health Awareness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/overdose","id":"overdose"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/suicide","id":"suicide"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/family%20not%20kept%20informed","id":"family not kept informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/person%20centredness","id":"person centredness"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/959788","id":"959788"}]},{"id":959524,"author":"Niamh","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Helpful around work commitments","body":"I received therapy from Inclusion Thurrock with Rebecca.

Overall I give 5 star rating considering everyone tried to tell me the hospital was not great especially for maternity I can vouch that this is not the case from my own experience so happy I did not listen to the negativity.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-07-25T07:27:11","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-07-25T12:29:00","readBy":[{"name":"Barts Health NHS Trust","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/959736","id":"959736"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/959736/responses","id":"959736"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/959736/healthservices","id":"959736"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/959736/tags","id":"959736"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/r1hnh","id":"R1HNH","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/birth","id":"birth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/delivery","id":"delivery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/in%20pain","id":"in pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/labour","id":"labour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/maternity","id":"maternity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/safe","id":"safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happy","id":"happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doing%20well","id":"doing well"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ventilated","id":"ventilated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20safe","id":"very safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20happy","id":"not happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20happy","id":"very happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/natural%20birth","id":"natural birth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20great","id":"not great"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/like%20myself","id":"like myself"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/959809","id":"959809"}]},{"id":959118,"author":"jazzsc38","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Life changing care","body":"I am very late to post this, but having just found this website i would like to pass on my thanks to Dr Brady and Dr Watkins at Glasgow Royal Infirmary Outpatients Dept.  \r\nDuring my early 20s i suffered from severe hypertension and was subsequently put on multiple bloody pressure medications for this and was also diagnosed with LV hypertrophy as a result. I was warned umpteen times not to fall pregnant as it would be dangerous for me. I also suffered lots of side effects from these medications and felt unwell for years. My care was transferred to the GRI in my 30s where i was seen by Dr Brady who discovered i had FMD in my renal artery which was causing the hypertension. I was then placed under the care of Dr Watkins who suggested an angioplasty and stent to attempt to treat this (i was informed this is not guaranteed to work). I was very lucky and the procedure cured my high blood pressure. I no longer need to take any medication for my blood pressure and am delighted to say i have recently had a healthy baby. I am seen annually for checkups and every time am treated with care, dignity and respect. I will never be able to thank Dr Watkins and Dr Brady enough for all the care i have been given from them and for the huge improvement in my life as a result.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-07-22T14:34:03.37","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-07-25T12:33:02.853","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":7}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/959118","id":"959118"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/959118/responses","id":"959118"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/959118/healthservices","id":"959118"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/959118/tags","id":"959118"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/g107h_320","id":"G107H_320","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/g107h-outpatients","id":"g107h-outpatients","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/angioplasty","id":"Angioplasty"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20pressure","id":"blood pressure"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctors","id":"doctors"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/high%20blood%20pressure","id":"high blood pressure"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hypertension","id":"hypertension"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hypertrophy","id":"hypertrophy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/renal","id":"renal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/respected","id":"respected"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stent","id":"stent"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/well%20looked%20after","id":"well looked after"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dignity","id":"Dignity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/961326","id":"961326"}]},{"id":959740,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Brilliant","body":"Friendly, informative and the procedure I was booked in for went very smooth.

Having suffered from previous miscarraiges we were extremely anxious when I became pregnant and experienced a few scares throughout my pregnancy  \r\nWe visited EPAS a few times initially and later the Day Care and Out of Hours unit for scans and checkups. The care we received was first class and every member of staff treated us with understanding, respect and dignity. We were absolutely terrified we would lose our baby but everyone who looked after us was incredibly caring and helped massively to reassure us and keep us calm.  \r\nAfter a failed induction I was taken for a C Section.

If any of us raised our own concerns or maybe appeared to be struggling with issues I feel confident that extra support would be available and offered. The content of the groups was all pertinent to rehab. The groups were well delivered in an appropriate way and homework assignments were relevant and essentially an extension of the groups that helped me increase my personal understanding of rehab and what it means. Overall, I found it very inclusive, that it fostered a sense of belonging and purpose and did help prepare me for rehab. I do now understand what will be expected of me and what to expect from rehab and I am very grateful for the opportunity. I'd score it a 9 out of 10 if asked.

Throwing up for 5 hours, after surgery, with very low blood pressure in that heat was not  very much fun.\nMy main concern is that there is such a lack of communication between staff, so much so that I had the same conversation at least 4 times about meds which was still changed at the last minute. I did feel bullied regarding medication even though I had full backing of my consultant. All in all, if there was a bit more cohesive thinking, this hospital would be great, the staff are lovely.

It's a battle to get past receptionists to see a doctor.  Getting through on the phone is a nightmare, you're either in a queue or have constant ringing with no answer.  Phone up for an appointment at 8am on the dot to see a specific doctor to be told they're fully booked and have to settle for a phone appointment with a doctor I've never spoken to before.  I don't understand why the surgery isn't back to normal face to face appointments and feel that Covid is being used as an excuse to implement and introduce lots of changes which aren't for the better.  Lots of people, me included, find it much easier speaking and explaining issues to a Dr face to face.  Phone appointments are awkward and not ideal especially when living in an area where phone reception isn't very good.  I absolutely dread having to ring for appointments.  It's embarrassing to have to explain to a receptionist what the issue is before being allowed any sort of consultation.  Reception staff often come across as abrupt and rude which is out of order as no one should be made to feel bad when they are ill and need help.  \nThe surgery needs to be back to running normal face to face appointments without having to jump through hoops to get one and if we have to phone at 8am for an appointment at least make sure there are plenty available.  Baffles me how we're not able to prebook appointments yet when phoning at 8am you eventually get through they've all gone and surgery is fully booked.  How does that happen if you can't prebook?
