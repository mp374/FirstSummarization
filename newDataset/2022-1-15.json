I could not get an appointment with the GP so called 111 for advice. I was told a doctor would call within 6 hours, however we received a call within 5 minutes. The doctor asked lots of questions to get a clear picture of what was going on and advised an ambulance due to concerns of sepsis. The ambulance arrived within 20 minutes and they were amazing. Checked his blood pressure, Sat's, blood etc and after doing the liaising with the doctor for us, they had him sorted on antibiotics within 30 minutes! We are very thankful for their speedy response and for how kind, professional and reassuring everyone was that we dealt with.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-01-14T22:22:14","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2022-01-15T13:41:07","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/909197","id":"909197"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/909197/responses","id":"909197"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/909197/healthservices","id":"909197"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/909197/tags","id":"909197"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/ntp","id":"NTP","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/antibiotics","id":"antibiotics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/arm","id":"arm"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood","id":"blood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20pressure","id":"blood pressure"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/generally%20unwell","id":"generally unwell"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/infection","id":"infection"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lethargic","id":"lethargic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sepsis","id":"sepsis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/veins","id":"veins"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing","id":"amazing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thankful","id":"Thankful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/under%20pressure","id":"under pressure"}]},{"id":909198,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Excellent care and treatment","body":"I underwent my second colonoscopy recently and once again the whole service was excellent.

I recognise the pandemic has caused major disruption to these services and I am aware this is out of anyone’s control. However, it’s hard not to be frustrated at the fact that the surgery has sent me numerous texts offering me to come in for the vaccine, but it is an absolute myth trying to get a face to face appointment. I have been wrongly put on a course of antibiotics after a telephone appointment that wasn’t the correct treatment for my issue. I learnt this when I went to a&e and the nurses and doctors there said I shouldn’t have taken the course. I don’t feel safe anymore or feel like I have somewhere to go for my health concerns. I’m sure I’m not the only one. And I find it quite infuriating that they seem to have capacity to see people to give them vaccines (that i’m sure they’re being paid to administer) but don’t seem able to hold face to face appointments. I don’t want to sound ungrateful or entitled, and I’m sure everyone working at the surgery is doing their absolute best but I think I am just going to have to change surgeries. I feel even more anxiety when I’m ill because I feel I will not be properly treated/ misdiagnosed. Also came in for a blood test that I never got the results for. Just seems to be some negligence going on since covid-19, not very proactive. Again, I really hope I haven’t offended the staff who are doing their absolute best, my issue is with the organisation and efficiency of the surgery.

Given that no one is allowed to accompany him due to current restrictions, and that he is hard of hearing and nearly 80 I presumed that he would be sent home with some information/leaflets etc about the procedure he'd had done and the after care required etc. He came home with nothing and struggled to remember the information that he was told at his appointment. He was given one contact telephone number but of course it is obviously office hours only so there was no answer when we rang for help. We have found it really distressing that we have had to use the internet and finally, the 111 service to get help and advice. Not an acceptable way to treat an elderly patient I'm afraid.
