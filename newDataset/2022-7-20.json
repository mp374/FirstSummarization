From the community midwives, my consultant to the nursing staff that supported with the birth of my baby girl at the start of July.  \r\nMy community midwife in Galashiels supported with anxieties around pregnancy, struggling with change and also external factors. Her manner and approach made me feel really supported which I am so grateful for. What's more having her throughout the whole pregnancy was fantastic for continuity and having that same friendly face.  \r\nWhen I went into labour at the BGH I found all the nursing staff and student nurses amazing. They couldn't do enough to keep my partner and I calm, comfortable and informed. We were looked after by the most wonderful senior midwife and student nurse who ensured we knew what was going on at all times from the moment we entered, to the emergency C section to the next day when she had arrived. Ward 16 looked after my baby girl and I for two days after, supporting with, breastfeeding and the emotional rollercoaster that is birth. They ensured not only my baby was well but me as a new mumma, something you don't think of when you have a little person to look after.  \r\nAftercare from the community midwives for the 10 days before health visiting take over was really supportive, encouraging positive feeding experiences, whatever that may be for me and my baby and ensuring that we are both doing well I was given lots of information and tips that have been invaluable.  \r\nI honestly can't thank all the staff enough as I don't think my experience would of been the same without the team effort of the staff involved in my care and the support given to my partner and baby girl.

I explained what had happened and she said she would get us a porter and a nurse out to car to help. They arrived with a chair but the lovely Matthew (agency nurse) assessed the situation and said they would get a trolley as it would be easier on Dad. Our experience was positive throughout as Mathew took charge and explained all to Dad and ensured we were kept informed. We encountered several staff in ED who always ensured Dad was comfortable, I didnâ€™t catch all the names - there was Leah, a staff nurse, Roisin, a staff nurse, Roisin a student nurse in yellow area and a nurse with a plait in yellow area. There was a lovely HCA who is a first year medical student who held Dads ear together while David, the Consultant, was meticulous about carefully stitching his ear. These staff were under extreme pressure in a busy ED dept, yet they never compromised on care and gave Dad the attention he required. Nothing was a bother to them.  \r\nI also want to commend the radiographers who undertook Dads imaging, Darren and Aoife who were courteous, professional and lovely to Dad. They then took him to the CT dept for a head scan and Chris the radiographer explained to Dad what was going to happen to allay his fears as he is a man in his 80s who luckily has had little experience of hospitals. The radiographers were very accommodating of Dad's confused state and did as much as possible to ensure he was not distressed.  \r\nI cannot relay how thankful I am to all the staff involved in Dad's attendance to ED and imaging yesterday.  \r\nA wonderful health service which should be appreciated.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-07-16T09:54:22.82","progress":"Story has a

Daisy ward has been good, the level of care is excellent. The ward is new and the rooms are good. The en-suites are good and the TV is a good addition to keep my son entertained. Just annoying being in here with the good weather.  \r\nThe staff are good, they are so open and do not sugar coat the truth.

Ok, sometimes there is a bit of a queue on call waiting but that is to be expected. Once through the person on Reception desk could not have been more kind and helpful.  The GP was excellent as were the staff at FairOak pharmacy. I know the surgery has at times been subject to some poor reviews but those do not reflect my experience. Great team doing an increasingly demanding job in very difficult times.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-07-20T08:41:39","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-07-20T12:55:15","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/958167","id":"958167"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/958167/responses","id":"958167"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/958167/healthservices","id":"958167"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/958167/tags","id":"958167"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/j82018","id":"J82018","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/face","id":"face"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pharmacy","id":"Pharmacy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20great","id":"not great"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/971082","id":"971082"}]},{"id":958165,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Check-in with I pad not helpful ","body":"I donâ€™t know how long people have had to self check-in with an I pad at A&E, but cannot see any benefit for patients.\nIs it meant to be a cost saving measure?

I have been referred to the mental health various times over the years but did not find it helped me. I felt very vulnerable and I worried that I would not get on with my therapist or that they wouldn't understand me. I was very wrong.  \r\nJason was patient, understanding and cared about my wellbeing. He helped me learn loads of new skills to deal with day to day life but most of all he helped me learn how to stop and control my OCD behaviours. Before therapy my quality of life was poor. I felt like OCD controlled my life and I couldn't stop the intrusive thoughts that entered my mind all day. Now I am equipped with new skills that Jason has helped me learn, practice and perfect.  \r\nI now live a life full of more self worth, freedom, social interaction with friends/family and I have reached goals I never thought I could reach, Jason gave me my life back, I am so glad that I took that leap of faith when contacting Bromley mental health and that I got referred to someone that genuinely cared about my mental, emotional and physical wellbeing. He was always happy to listen to me, to help me learn how to navigate tricky situations in my personal life and how to have more self compassion. I will always be incredibly grateful to Jason for everything he has helped me with throughout my journey.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-07-19T10:47:40.04","progress":"Story
