I was so pleased and when I got home I realised that I had probably not expressed my gratitude properly.\nI am very grateful for all the treatment I received both at MMH and Maidstone Oncology unit where I had Radio-therapy treatment. Initially, I was suffering with a group 3 Tumour in my bladder which was treated which was taking up about 65% of available space. This was treated and approximately 95% was removed followed by a short stay in Sunderland Ward. Then I opted for Radio treatment to get rid of the final 'bits' at Maidstone and was amazed at the lengths they went to with transport to and from Gillingham. \nAll in all I am glad the NHS facilities and considerate staff was on hand along with support from Macmillan staff to see me safely through what was/is a very traumatic time. I am pleased to say that I am feeling very well (for someone of 85 years old) and am slowly getting back into my garden which gives me great pleasure.\nI am taking my time and stop when I feel I have done enough, knowing that there is always tomorrow.\nThank you for all your kindness and patience and I hope all staff can get through these dreadful times safely.

She was admitted to the Wallace suite. My mum had been in hospital for 5 months. I have to say, I wasnâ€™t sure about the move, but it ended up being the best thing that could have happened for my mum and us as a family. The hospital itself is lovely with a big airy room and the staff are second to none. My mum was at end of life and passed away 2 weeks ago, but she was so looked after in there. The staff really cared about her. She was always comfortable and cosy in her bed. Her her hair was brushed, moisturiser rubbed in, clean nails - they just took such good care of her in her final moments. 2 nurses stayed with us and one held my mums hand when she took her final breath. I can not thank or praise them enough. Such kind and compassionate staff, from head of the ward to the cleaning staff and everyone in between. I will forever be grateful that my mum spent the last weeks of her life there, and again, the staff are just wonderful - they are a credit to their profession.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-05-07T17:06:23.58","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-05-10T09:51:44.223","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Forth Valley","count":3}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/937216","id":"937216"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/937216/responses","id":"937216"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/937216/healthservices","id":"937216"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/937216/tags","id":"937216"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sv9-wallace-suite","id":"sv9-wallace-suite","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/all%20staff","id":"all staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cleaning%20staff","id":"cleaning staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/end%20of%20life","id":"end of life"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good%20care","id":"good care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kind%20staff","id":"kind staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lovely","id":"lovely"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/passed%20away","id":"passed away"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/personal%20care","id":"personal care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/praise","id":"praise"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/room","id":"room"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/well%20looked%20after","id":"well looked after"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20for","id":"cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassionate","id":"compassionate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/like%20i%20mattered","id":"like I mattered"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wonderful","id":"wonderful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wonderful%20staff","id":"wonderful staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/held%20hand","id":"held hand"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thanks","id":"thanks"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/forever%20grateful","id":"forever grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ward%20manager","id":"ward manager"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/comfortable","id":"comfortable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/a%20credit","id":"a credit"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/second%20to%20none","id":"second to none"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/938280","id":"938280"}]},{"id":937213,"author":"Matdw53","authorRoleId":8,"authorRole":"a staff member posting for a patient/service user","title":"Very effective and excellent care","body":"My care on the ward has well and truly been excellent and I couldnâ€™t say a bad word about a single thing that I have experienced in the hospital.

The day after, I woke up with my wrist not being able to move, pain, swelling, and stuck in the shape of a claw. I then went back to A&E a few days later, had an x-ray, and ended up being referred to the orthopaedic team. 2 weeks later, I had to have another X-Ray and an appointment with a doctor. At the first appointment, I felt like I was spoken to in a patronising way and left quite upset and still unsure of what was going on with my wrist.  \r\n4 weeks later I had another appointment with the same doctor, who informed me that if it was fractured, there was nothing that the hospital would be able to do for it which left me confused. I was also told that the reason my hand was in the shape of a claw was due to me not using it, when I couldn't use it because of the pain I was in, which left me feeling like the consultant was blaming me for this issue. I then was referred for a CT scan. In December, I had another appointment where I was supposed to find out my results and didn't, and was told I could have regional pain syndrome, but that there was nothing they could do about it.  \r\nIn late January I found out I needed an MRI, which left me having to wait nearly 9 weeks to even find out anything. I have had no check-up appointments during this time and still to this day haven't had an appointment since January. I am left in ongoing pain, swelling, and a wrist that I am unable to use. I still do not know my CT results and MRI results. I was left questioning myself and questioning am I making it up? This has honestly affected my day-to-day life and from a hospital, I expect to be believed. Even though I am having these scans, I am still being made to believe that this is my fault by the consultant. After 8 weeks of waiting, I rang the reception, who said the letter had just been sent out. After 9 weeks of waiting, I was told in a letter from the MRI that one of the findings from the scan was I had a cyst (which isn't the whole MRI findings and CT findings, as I am having to find out my full results from the surgeon) and that I am referred to an upper limb surgeon. I rang up the hospital but they don't know anything about an appointment for me. I have been waiting a further nearly 3 weeks for an appointment when I haven't even had a check-up since January. This whole nearly 9 months of my hospital experience as an outpatient has made me lose faith in the hospital, with feeling like it was my fault, when I was getting sent for further scans. This is still ongoing and after 8 and a half months I'm shocked that I am still having to go through this.  \r\n-MRI results I still don't fully know.  \r\n-CT results from November I still don't fully know.  \r\nThe only good part about it is that the X-Ray, CT, MRI, and Physio teams have all been good and I have felt listened to by them.","criticality":"moderately

Maria was amazing, she explained the induction process that I was admitted for and ensured I was comfortable at all times. I also was cared for by a midwife who's second name was McFaul on the night shift. Again, she was amazing, comforting and reassuring and taking into consideration my wish to transfer to labour ward for an epidural in a timely manner and ensuring this happened.  \r\nWhen I went to the labour ward I met Sr. Joan. I immediately felt safe in the hands of Joan and knew she was very knowledgeable in her role. Joan ensured I received my epidural in a timely manner and escalated concerns when she became concerned about my baby's heart rate. Joan holistically cared for myself, my baby and also my partner, guiding him to the car in a hurry to grab his insulin before I was transferred to theatre, and helping him gown up appropriately. Joan then visited us in recovery to congratulate us and see our baby. I feel Joan is an absolute asset to the labour ward team and noticed the trust the doctors had in her, as they ask for her opinion on matters. I was reviewed by doctors Emma and Catriona who were lovely. They explained all their concerns to me and advised that an emergency c section was in my baby's best interests. I knew I was in safe hands with these doctors delivering our baby and I will be forever grateful for their prompt decision making and the trouble shooting they done, before deciding on the plan of care. Both doctors spoke to us after the delivery of our baby, congratulated us and ask if we had any questions about the decision made or the birth. Midwife Ashleigh also cared for us in the labour ward and recovery, and was very kind and reassuring to us both, staying after her shift to ensure all checks were completed and we were safe and well.  \r\nI am so grateful to the entire labour ward team and will never forget how safe they made me feel in such a terrifying situation.","criticality":"not

My appointment with the consultant was brilliant, informative and helpful. I was admitted a short time later for a procedure. I followed the self isolation guidance pre admission, only leaving home to have my PCR two days prior, which was negative. On the morning of my procedure, my daughter dropped me off, I was welcomed, and told to sit outside the unit for further information. A nurse came around 30 mins later and was a little abrupt, demanding a lateral flow be completed. I didn't understand the rationale and was offered little explanation except for the fact that it had to be done, and they then told me to put my head back. I wasn't allowed the opportunity or time to blow my nose and the instructions on the LFT say this should be done before tests are completed, and as I suffer with sinus problems, I would have liked the opportunity to have done this. The nurse quickly went away and I was called in by a staff member, had some questions, and prepared for theatre. I was waiting in the ward when a nurse came in and said my procedure was cancelled, as I had just tested positive for Covid-19. They left quickly and offered no explanation, advice, support or help in any way with what my next steps were. I appreciate the situation was out of their hands, but a bit of respect, dignity and support goes a long way. I left after getting dressed, no one came near me, or asked how I was getting home, or if I needed something to eat or drink as I had been fasting. I appreciate we are on the other side of a pandemic but I felt that I was treated like I had the actual plague - it was a very demeaning and humiliating experience.  \r\nWhen I eventually got home, I followed the guidance and isolated, however, I did a lateral flow once home which was negative (I believe my technique is fine as my daughter is a nurse and had taught me how to do them properly). I continued to test twice a day until my isolation time ended and I remained negative for my entire period of isolation. It's now around 5 weeks and I am still waiting for someone to contact me with a rescheduled date for my urgent procedure. I will keep trying to get a date. Whilst my initial appointment with my consultant was very helpful and informative and overall a great experience, the time spent on DSU has made me uncomfortable. I should highlight, I'm not questioning the fact that the procedure was cancelled, I understand the reasons etc, but I do have some queries/wonders about the testing process and the after part.  \r\nWhen the lateral flow that become positive was done, there were other patients, is it possible mine was mistaken, or mislabelled, or mixed up? Are there processes to prevent this happening? What is the point in sending a patient for a PCR if a lateral flow is going to be done on day of surgery? I wouldn't want anyone to have the same experience as I did.  \r\nMany thanks.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-05-07T18:29:20.1666667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-05-10T11:12:02.663","readBy":[{"name":"Northern Health and Social Care Trust","count":7},{"name":"Ulster University, MBBS (Medicine) 2021","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/937220","id":"937220"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/937220/responses","id":"937220"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/937220/healthservices","id":"937220"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/937220/tags","id":"937220"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt002_24027_502","id":"ZT002_24027_502","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt002-aah-day-surgery","id":"zt002-aah-day-surgery","score":2},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confused","id":"confused"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/abrupt","id":"abrupt"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/advice","id":"advice"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/brilliant","id":"brilliant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cancelled%20operation","id":"cancelled operation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/consultant","id":"consultant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/contact","id":"contact"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/day%20surgery","id":"day surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/demeaning","id":"demeaning"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dirty","id":"dirty"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/explanation","id":"explanation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/guidance","id":"guidance"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gynae","id":"gynae"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gynaecology%20outpatients","id":"Gynaecology Outpatients"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/help","id":"help"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helpful","id":"helpful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/informative","id":"informative"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lack%20of%20support","id":"lack of support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/respect","id":"respect"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/uncomfortable","id":"uncomfortable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dignity","id":"Dignity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/time%20given","id":"Time given"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thanks","id":"thanks"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/humiliating","id":"humiliating"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%20positive%20test","id":"covid positive test"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%2019","id":"covid 19"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/many%20thanks","id":"many thanks"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pcr","id":"pcr"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/self%20isolation","id":"self isolation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lateral%20flow%20test","id":"lateral flow test"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/939333","id":"939333"}]},{"id":937689,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Frustration overload!","body":"Trying to book travel vaccines - after trying to phone for over 2 weeks, 48th in queue, 46th in queue etc etc etc  ( I canâ€™t pop in as I work the hours they are open) and there being no online option like all other doctors seem to provide, I finally get to talk to someone who advised we need to collect forms to fill in, no online option.

Never been disappointed by this surgery.  Very friendly and efficient.  \nI have to admit, I was a little wary about using one of their (non-permanent?!) Doctors, but pleasantly surprised.  I was completely put at ease and my problems were sorted very efficiently in a non-rushed and friendly manner.  I have been treated by all doctors in the same manner.\nI think it's important to acknowledge the great work the receptionists and people that work behind the scenes do to keep this place running so sharp.  Admittedly there has been once or twice where there's been confusion over prescriptions, this is going to happen in any surgery, but the receptionists have always put this right in a timely manner.  This surgery has it all.  From your first point of call, you are greeted in a friendly manner.  Most often if the reception can't solve your problem immediately, they will call you back the same day, often within minutes.  \nI feel so privileged to be part of such a great medical center.

Turns out MAU had moved location and was in a completely different part of the building from where signs direct you. Due to my condition, I didn't arrive at the new MAU (which was situated in a day surgery unit) until about half an hour later. I wasn't seen until over 5 hours later and wasn't offered any food or drink until then. I think that's a long time for a pregnant woman to be left and not offered food or drink.  \r\nUpon admission, I explained that I was vegan. The HCSW that night gave me soya milk in my tea but for the rest of my stay I was told there were no milk alternatives for me. The toast in the morning was already pre-buttered. No milk for cereal. I was never offered a vegan lunch or dinner (I was in MAU for over 48 hours). I couldn't get a shower the full time I was there as there were no shower facilities. I had to chase up my own chest x-ray to be reported so that a VQ scan could be organised before the weekend, because a doctor refused to phone radiology and chase it up for me, even though this was the only thing holding me back from being discharged with the suitable treatment. I was moved beds in the early morning on my second night. On the third day, I went to QEUH for a VQ scan and when I arrived back the same day, MAU had been moved back to it's original location, but I was to stay at the old, empty location. I had missed lunch and wasn't offered any. I wasn't discharged until after 4 hours later. No food or drink had been offered to me since breakfast.  \r\nNobody recorded hcg levels of my bloods.  \r\nI was diagnosed with clots in my lungs and discharged with injections to take, but no follow up appointments could be made for me as haematology wouldn't take me because I was pregnant. Maternity wouldn't take me as I wasn't pregnant enough, so it was up to me to contact my GP and work out a plan on how someone could take me under their care to ensure my injections were the correct dose (I am now finally under suitable care and have been moved to a higher dose as the dose I was discharged with wasn't working as well as it should. Thank goodness I managed to organise myself outpatient follow ups to check my bloods or I would probably have had to be re-admitted to hospital). I believe the doctor and nurse who finally discharged me did all they could within their power but apart from that my care wasn't great. I was undermined and ignored and I felt like MAU was a lonely (and hungry) place to be. Someone could have at least organised a hot meal for me and to be able to use a shower somewhere. Thank you to the nurse who escorted me to my VQ scan and to the nurse who consoled me when I was crying. Thank you to the radiographer who took my x-ray and took time to speak with me and treat me like a human. Thank you to all porters I met. Thank you to the domestic who cleaned the room I was in. Thank you to the staff at QEUH nuclear medicine for being caring and understanding. I found peace in the chapel in RAH. I wasn't given any information about this but I found it myself and it did bring me some hope when I felt very lonely.","criticality":"moderately

By this point I was told my child would be placed on a waiting list for support with the South Team and we would be placed on a waiting list for family therapy. Unfortunately we are still waiting in May 2022 and, understanding that I had been battling to try and be taken seriously and get support for my daughter we were asked if she would like to take part in a study into trauma in January 2022. As we had received nothing else and my daughter was struggling to cope with daily life we agreed as we felt that something was better than nothing. Unfortunately my daughter did not possess the coping strategies to deal with the study and attempted suicide for the third time in February 2022, each time going one step further in a cry for help. During the assessment at the hospital the following day with a member of the Crisis Team I had to actually tell her to stop talking over me and let me speak, my daughter feels the same way as I do when I say that she did not listen to either of us until I said that. Surely that is not productive when trying to assess the needs and mental state of the young person involved?  \r\nAs a family this has taken it's toll on us, to the point that my younger child is now struggling to cope with what has happened and is now needing support too. It is affecting schooling at a critical time in my children's academic lives as they struggle to attend, my job is now at risk because of the time off I have had to have to support my children, my children barely go out of their rooms and almost 11 weeks after the third attempt we are still being seen by the Crisis Team and not a care coordinator for the South Team. My child hardly sleeps and can go 2 or 3 days on just a couple of hours sleep in total, she did not attend school 2 days ago because her thoughts to harm herself were so bad she refused to get out of bed because she was terrified and we had to call the Crisis Team for support. The 2 team members in the Crisis Team were only supposed to offer 6 weeks support yet 11 weeks in we are still under them as they cannot get my child the support needed from the South Team yet but they are not in place for such a role. I called the South Team 2 days ago to ask if my child was being picked up yet as it is almost 2 weeks since the Crisis Team submitted an IR1 form regarding the delay in working with my child and was told that someone would call me back between 2pm and 5pm that day, over 48 hours later I am still waiting and in the meantime the Crisis medic will not do a medic review because my child is open to the South Team and it should apparently be their medic that does the review. In the meantime my child has to try and deal with her own negative thoughts on very little sleep, not a very good combination.  \r\nI have submitted my second thorough complaint to PALS regarding the service offered and will be discussing CAMHS support with my local MP in conjunction with the student support manager from my children's school as the service offered to not just my children but all young people desperately needing help is severely lacking and at a critical level.  \r\nWith the dramatic increase in a need for such an essential service something needs to change and quickly, parents and young people should not have to face such a battle to try and access help or be heard. I have only briefly skimmed the surface with the difficulties we are facing right now regarding CAMHS support, particularly within a community setting and if we are experiencing this then there has to be thousands more families in the same position. As a mother my heart is breaking every day seeing my children struggle with their mental health and feel so alone and hopeless. I just hope that I can keep my child safe whilst we wait for the support because I dread to think of the alternative.","criticality":"strongly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-05-06T16:15:51.6966667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-05-10T13:56:41.963","readBy":[{"name":"Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust","count":10}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/936987","id":"936987"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/936987/responses","id":"936987"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/936987/healthservices","id":"936987"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/936987/tags","id":"936987"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rha-camhs-city","id":"rha-camhs-city","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hopeless","id":"Hopeless"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20listened%20to","id":"not listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/should%20listen","id":"Should listen"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/alone","id":"alone"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/broken","id":"broken"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/camhs","id":"camhs"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/crisis%20care","id":"crisis care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/listening","id":"listening"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/more%20funding","id":"More funding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pals","id":"pals"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/suicidal","id":"suicidal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting%20times","id":"waiting times"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dejected","id":"dejected"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/community%20support","id":"community support"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/938832","id":"938832"}]},{"id":937241,"author":"older devon maid","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"COVID-19 elective self-swab service","body":"I was sent a self-swab in anticipation of a day case cataract operation in 3 days time.

After seeking advice from 111, I was informed to go the A and E and that I had an appointment within 25 minutes. This burn spread the front and side of my thigh and blistered almost instantly, the burning sensation lasted hours - I was in absolute agony.\n\nUpon arrival at the A and E, I was stood in the reception queue, in floods of tears in pain - I wasn't seen for close to ten minutes at reception, standing on the burnt leg, despite several nurses and staff walking past.\n\n I was then told, there was no appointments and that I could be waiting 2 hours, with patients having waited 20. Why is this appointment service in force? I truly wonder how long I could have been made to stand there excruciating pain.\n\nNext, I was asked to sit and wait, having a panic attack due to the pain, my boyfriend was then asked to leave as it was \"patient only\". I cannot comprehend how grossly unfair this was in the circumstances.\n\nAfter 10-15 minutes, a receptionist took it upon herself to rush me through to give me something for the pain, and I'm very thankful for her doing so and I was finally seen.\n\nHowever, the treatment received in A and E was just as bad. After being seen in a triage bay I felt like a burden - one doctor came in and saw me for a maximum of 15 seconds, stating 'first degree' . He then left. I sat for a further 15 minutes in excruciating pain, with several nurses coming into my bay to grab things they needed (chairs, BP machines - not for me), and nobody updating me on my treatment or giving me anything to cool the burn. After close to 20 minutes in the treatment bay, I asked a nurse in the state I was in why nobody was helping and finally received a dose of morphine. The burn was evidently severe for morphine to be given. \n\nAfter 20 minue passed, a doctor I hadn't seen before asked me to leave my bay and I was placed on a staff chair. \n\nMy leg was eventually dressed, to which a doctor came over and stopped the nurse in her tracks stating the dressing must be removed due to heat, to which it was torn back off. Unnecessary. I was then told I was discharged on ibuprofen, I had to beg for a stronger painkiller. \n\n5 different people treated me, each not knowing the previous persons actions. \n\nThe whole A and E process from start to finish was a mess. It was grossly unfair. I attended in agony, severely distressed from the pain and had to beg for help. I truly wonder how long I could have sat if that lady at reception hadn't took it upon herself to rush me through. This morning, I'm left with 10 blisters over 50p in size, no dressing, with burning continuing. I will be attending my walk in centre to have this dealt with. \n\nTo pride themselves on the values this hospital does, and leave a patient unseen in so much pain is frankly, unbelievable.\n\nThe NHS is at its capacity, staff are overwhelmed, but this is showing in patient care. If that wasn't an emergency - what is. \n","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-05-10T05:25:09","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-05-10T14:25:57","readBy":[{"name":"Blackpool Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/937761","id":"937761"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/937761/responses","id":"937761"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/937761/healthservices","id":"937761"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/937761/tags","id":"937761"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rxl01","id":"RXL01","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/burden","id":"burden"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/burn","id":"burn"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/burnt","id":"burnt"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/distressed","id":"distressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dressing","id":"dressing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency","id":"emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/in%20pain","id":"in pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/informed","id":"informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/leg","id":"leg"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/morphine","id":"morphine"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/panic","id":"panic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/panic%20attack","id":"panic attack"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stronger","id":"stronger"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/torn","id":"torn"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/triage","id":"triage"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thankful","id":"Thankful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/like%20a%20burden","id":"like a burden"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20thankful","id":"very thankful"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/947471","id":"947471"}]},{"id":937771,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Lovely doctors and nurses, shame about theâ€¦","body":"The doctors and nurses have always been helpful and caring - but unfortunately the booking system is anything but straightforward to navigate.
