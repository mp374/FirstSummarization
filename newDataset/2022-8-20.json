They are doing their best in what seems like a nightmarish system.\nAbsolutely zero consistency between reception staff - seems like only one staff member out of the entire reception team knows how to use computers and digital forms, making it extremely challenging to process things like blood forms, medicine requests, even phone appointments. I have been there in person before trying to sort out a digital problem that the practice asked me to sign up for, and have witnessed another staff member essentially shouting from the back office to the front reception with instructions for my receptionist on how to fix it.\nWas recommended to use a system called Systmonline for prescriptions then within about two months was told to use an app called Airmid instead (doesn't work, and I am very comfortable and familiar with how to use a smartphone). Then told to switch to Dr. Iq which does everything in its power possible to prevent you from booking an appointment for genuine reasons. \nAsked to change my personal details at the surgery due to change of name and contact details; given a wonky printout that looks like it was made in the 60s, didn't have half the details one would expect to be able to update in this day and age such as title. Receptionist was stressed and confused about this process.\nMy nhs records were updated but Dr Iq continued to have my old details. I addressed this multiple times with the staff but they have no idea how the app works. I uninstalled it because if I made any requests via the app, they continued to be listed under my old details therefore confusing the staff and inadvertently misgendering me when responding to them. The callback system linked with Dr Iq is awful.\nEvery phone call starts with nearly 2 minutes of my time wasted on a recording telling me to use this awful app.\nOn top of this, 9 times out of 10 when I phone up, I'm told to hold immediately which can be quite a shock - when I've visited in person I've witnessed the staff do this as well and it's obviously distressing the patient calling up from the other end of the conversation I notice. I have been inadvertently hung up on this way, and they never call you back - you have to sit through the same 2 minutes' recording then join the queue then they have no record of your conversation.

But not any more. I lack trust in them now. After seeing a Paramedic person in May 2022 to be told she would refer me to physio, but she failed to do that. I had to chase it up in August 2022. I did get it referred immediately but that was due to my persistence. I had a telephone appointment with a Gp I needed to speak to them. I was told they would ring me sometime in the Afternoon.  I didn’t get to the phone in time. Had I have had a time slot like with a face to face appointment then I would have had the phone in my hand & been able to speak with him. I phoned back within minutes, I was told he would ring me back, but he never did. I visited the surgery as I needed a prescription from the Gp for my problem. I was told there was nothing they could do as I missed the call. Try iHeart Barnsley or visit the chemist. The chemist could give me a £18.00 solution for my problem, But I had to see the Gp to get the solution on prescription. I had no choice but to pay the £18.00 out as I needed the treatment. Something needs to change. I don’t mind having a telephone appointment, but I need a time slot please. Not sometime in the afternoon.  Also there are a lot Of new reception staff at this practice. They are nothing like the old staff. Why all of a sudden are the staff asking Why we need to see or speak to a Gp. That is my business. I feel that I am capable of ringing for a Gp appointment because I have something wrong with me, I am not ringing to waste the time of the Gp.   The appointment system needs to change with regards to the time slot. It cannot be an open time slot. If appointments can be sent from Barnsley Hospital with a time to ring them on then this practice can do The same. \nI have no faith in this practice any more. This practice has a lot of new medical staff too, some of whom are not actually Gp’s I fully understand that the medical practice is changing & there are new schemes being implemented, but the schemes need to actually work for it to be trusted & accepted as the normal way that the practice works","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-08-20T11:57:37","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-08-20T20:14:11","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/968338","id":"968338"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/968338/responses","id":"968338"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/968338/healthservices","id":"968338"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/968338/tags","id":"968338"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/c85007","id":"C85007","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/face","id":"face"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hand","id":"hand"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/normal","id":"normal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/physio","id":"physio"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waste%20of%20time","id":"waste of time"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/capable","id":"capable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/like%20myself","id":"like myself"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/969539","id":"969539"}]},{"id":968339,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Fantastic Clinic","body":"From the initial assessment to the removal of my cataract, I cannot thank the whole team the patient service was professional, friendly and totally committed to every patient nothing was too much trouble,Would highly recommend Spamedica.Thank you","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-08-20T17:33:11","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-08-20T20:14:28","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/968339","id":"968339"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/968339/responses","id":"968339"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/968339/healthservices","id":"968339"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/968339/tags","id":"968339"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/o1p6x","id":"O1P6X","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cataract","id":"cataract"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/968843","id":"968843"}]},{"id":968335,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Great hospital ","body":"Absolutely fantastic staff and hospital.

I spent the day on ward b1. I was looked after and cared for by some wonderful nurses. They did an excellent job of making the stay easy. It was my very first time in hospital (and I am a woman of a certain age) I also had to go across to the pink rose suite for a procedure and that was easy too. I arrived at 7.30 am. I had my operation at 4pm. It was a long day. By the time I had the operation I was very hungry and thirsty.  No sooner was I back on the ward, there was a tray of toast and jam, a cup of coffee and jug of water. Very much appreciated. The aftercare was excellent.

The outgoing message is over a minute long before you can speak to anyone, my own surgery answers my call in 20 seconds. Big difference.  In waiting for my previous calls to be answered, I've started at no.26 in queue, when I have reached no.1 I have then had the phone put down and then on the hook.  Today I gave up after 20 minutes, and then tried again only to wait on a different line for another 25 minutes.  It has happened numerous times. The Reception clearly needs more staff but at any rate needs re-organising. The place also needs updating, there's a sense of things being \"antiquated\".

Our first trip to Hull Royal since taking her out of there as a new born baby. We were seen quickly and he care, nurture and kindness from the staff was incredible, as was the receptionist who was dealing with two abusive parents. In and out in 2 hours and not sitting without an update for more than 15 minutes on a busy weekend. Children's ward was so child friendly and my little girl was really relaxed. Shout out to the X ray team who made a scary situation a positiclve experience.Perfect example of when the NHS works well. Thank you so much.
