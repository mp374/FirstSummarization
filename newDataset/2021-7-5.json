I visited as  usual and was re-directed where a staff member told me that there was no visiting at all on this 'new ward'. My relative was just more confused and placed in a side room. He is very hard of hearing, cannot use a phone properly and thought i had abandoned him!. Since transfer, its not clear to me what plans or treatment are likely or when even though i am able to speak with him upon request. Today he was more upset and wanted me to bring him home. I asked a member of staff and found that my relative had moved back to a side room  again. My relative could not understand why and was distressed. I do understand especially in a unit such as would not make arrangements for restricted visiting. In my relative's case it makes them more muddled and disorientated etc with none of the normal trappings of his life like family, visitors etc. i find inhuman and promoting institutionalisation.

I received a self assessment form which I then returned to the practice around a week later. I have now had a call back from the GP essentially saying that even though I had submitted the form, the NHS wouldn't do anything like offering a diagnosis/assessment as they are more focused on other areas of mental health such as psychosis, suicidal thoughts etc, and that I could either potentially pay to go private and get a diagnosis and then receive NHS assistance or otherwise, just to get on with it.  \r\nI understand that these areas will take priority, as they can be much more concerning and quickly changing. However, the process of filling out the assessment and then receiving the phonecall just to be told that they can't offer any assistance at all seems like a waste of time and has just left me feeling more stressed than before I had enquired. In short, the whole process has just made me feel like I have been palmed off and to get on with it myself, and just seems pointless.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-07-01T16:56:39.4933333","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2021-07-05T09:20:06.537","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Education for Scotland","count":1},{"name":"NHS Borders","count":6},{"name":"Scottish Government","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/859336","id":"859336"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/859336/responses","id":"859336"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/859336/healthservices","id":"859336"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/859336/tags","id":"859336"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sb9-gp","id":"SB9-GP","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stressed","id":"stressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/access%20to%20mental%20health%20services","id":"access to mental health services"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/adhd","id":"adhd"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/assessment","id":"assessment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diagnosis","id":"diagnosis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disheartened","id":"disheartened"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fed%20up","id":"fed up"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gp","id":"GP"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pointless","id":"pointless"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/realistic%20expectations","id":"realistic expectations"}]},{"id":859344,"author":"Naomi D","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Stay in hospital","body":"I have just come out of a stay in Lincoln hospital.  \r\nFirstly, what I will say is that the staff in all the wards I went to, no matter what level, were lovely. They work so hard and the pressure on them is ridiculous, yet they still do it with a smile on their face.  \r\nI first went into the Urgent Treatment Centre and, although it was very busy, I got seen pretty quickly. I was advised they needed to speak to the surgical team as I may need to be admitted. As it’s something I’ve been dealing with for a while, it was what I was expecting.  \r\nHowever, due to how many people were in the hospital at the time, I ended up waiting from 7pm and finally got onto the ward at 11.55 the next day. This was nobody’s fault, it was just how busy they are. The team on UTC were so caring that they ended up making me a bed up in one of their treatment rooms as I was really struggling.  \r\nOnce I got onto SEAU, they worked hard to make sure all the new patients were assessed whilst still dealing with patients already in their care. All of the staff were lovely, helpful and just really looked after you.  \r\nAll the staff I came across in both departments are a credit to the hospital.  \r\nThe only downside for me (aside from the long wait) is the desk at UTC. It really does need to be more private.

My issue is with the procedure waiting time and keeping patients in the loop. I found this intolerable. I have spent the last two years sleeping in a chair because of reflux. I waited over a year to be seen and have a bravo fitted under sedation. This was unsuccessful so I was put on the list to have the procedure under a general anaesthetic. I called almost every week, desperate for the procedure and was told each time by the head nurse that as soon as the list became available, I would be put on it. I had a missed call on Monday so I called on Tuesday I was so excited to finally get an appointment, and see the light at the end of the tunnel finally. What I was told was that I hadn't been put on the list and would have to wait until August to see if I was put on then. I couldn't believe my ears. It felt so cruel and unnecessary that I hung up and burst into tears. I have depression and PTSD, and it triggered me. The thought of having to suffer indefinitely was almost too much to cope with. I can't stop crying. I feel betrayed and mislead.

I was told to wait for my new medication. At 5 pm my medication was handed to me in a pharmacy bag and my husband picked me up.

When I was first on 2 West my buzzer did not work as it took 4 presses of the button to register and when the midwife came to me she said I was pressing on the buzzer as if my baby had fallen out of the cot and I needed urgent attention, however it was merely because my buzzer did not function properly.  \r\nThe second time I was back on 2 West again I was placed into a room where the buzzer again does not work so I am disappointed this is the case 2 weeks later still. I felt left in such a state after this and after just giving birth it was difficult and I couldn't even speak to my own mother on the phone as I just didn't feel up for it. My mother rang the ward to complain and she also felt like the midwife on the phone was cheeky to her too. I felt insulted. I was in agony and they didn't understand. They were rather ignorant to problems which could have been easily fixed. I feel after voicing to the head midwife nothing improved.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-07-03T19:21:33.8633333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-07-05T09:20:09.81","readBy":[{"name":"Southern Health and Social Care Trust","count":7},{"name":"Public Health Agency","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/859853","id":"859853"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/859853/responses","id":"859853"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/859853/healthservices","id":"859853"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/859853/tags","id":"859853"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_32024-2-west","id":"zt003_32024-2-west","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disappointed","id":"disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/insulted","id":"insulted"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood","id":"blood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20transfusion","id":"blood transfusion"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/c-section","id":"c-section"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/giving%20birth","id":"giving birth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/maternity","id":"maternity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/operation","id":"operation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/section","id":"section"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attitude","id":"staff attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/understanding","id":"understanding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20disappointed","id":"very disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/response%20to%20buzzers","id":"response to buzzers"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tired","id":"tired"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20happy","id":"not happy"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/863262","id":"863262"}]},{"id":859859,"author":"Atrial Patient","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"A&E ambulance Admission","body":"Admitted to whiston hospital Via Ambulance service.

When I started experiencing health issues a week ago, it had proven difficult to get medical help straight away.  \r\nI contacted drop-in Sexual Health Clinic, which due to pandemic is no longer a drop-in, I wasn’t able to get an appointment because I wasn’t yet registered with GP.  \r\nFinding a GP office that would take new patients wasn’t easy. Eventually, I got one, rushed there to fill out enrollment form. However, when I asked when would I be able to see a doctor/nurse regarding my problem- I was told to wait until I’m actually registered in the system and can send an online request. I felt uncomfortable saying out loud in front of other people waiting at the reception area, that I’m bleeding like hell for 3 weeks, having abdominal pain and becoming seriously scared, so I just left.  \r\nI tried calling 111, gave up after 27 minutes of waiting on the line with no answer.  \r\nYesterday, when I was absolutely panicking, because I felt that I really needed to see a doctor, I reached out to my GP office and was told the earliest they could speak to me is Monday next week.  \r\nEventually, I reached out to Sexual Health Clinic again and they promised the nurse would call.  \r\nSusan got in touch very quickly, listened to my case, agreed that bleeding heavily for 3 weeks isn’t any good, and thank God for her understanding, as she agreed to see me later that day. I had tears of joy, as finally I was getting help.  \r\nEverything ran smooth during the appointment, she did all the checks, answered dozens of my questions and reassured me when I had concerns, advised me on the way forward, and I left with the medication that is already helping to treat my issue. I can not express how grateful I am to this lady. If it wasn’t for her and the help she provided, I would still be bleeding abnormally and feeling helpless.

She then did a thorough assessment and arranged for him to be seen in the hospital immediately.

He tells me how lovely your manner was and how well you listened to him - so thank you for that too.\nI have a friend who works at the QE who told me later 'it took the hospital 27 hours and several tests to come to the same conclusion the GP had written in her letter.' which says a lot for your clinical and diagnosis skills.\n\nDad is now in the Freeman and feeling much better, but waiting for an aortic valve replacement, so has to stay there until its done. \n\nMany thanks to you both and your colleagues for all of your hard work, but particularly in this case.\n","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2021-07-05T08:50:25","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-07-05T10:13:14","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/860088","id":"860088"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/860088/responses","id":"860088"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/860088/healthservices","id":"860088"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/860088/tags","id":"860088"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/a85007","id":"A85007","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20listened%20to","id":"not listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diagnosis","id":"diagnosis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/failure","id":"failure"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/heart","id":"heart"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/heart%20failure","id":"heart failure"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tests","id":"tests"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/valve","id":"valve"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/valve%20replacement","id":"valve replacement"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thanks","id":"thanks"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/saved","id":"saved"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/860295","id":"860295"}]},{"id":860097,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"useless","body":"never  try to  ring  waist time   and when  confronted  sorry  all  appoinments  taken  phone  always  ingaged   not  polite walkd  in  asked  why  phone engaged  all  time   when  i even  had  phone  in  my  hand rining it  it  said  same thing  reception  wasnt even  on  phone   ","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2021-07-05T09:07:00","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-07-05T10:18:27","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/860097","id":"860097"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/860097/responses","id":"860097"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/860097/healthservices","id":"860097"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/860097/tags","id":"860097"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/d81603","id":"D81603","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hand","id":"hand"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/876176","id":"876176"}]},{"id":860098,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Tick box exercise","body":"I had a telephone consultation with the bowel specialist and felt it was a tick box exercise.

I’ve tried desperately not to bother the drs throughout Covid & lockdown.

This is simply not good enough when you have an infection that needs antibiotics that day… not another day of waiting. It causes patients unnecessary stress, anxiety and discomfort.  Ringing first thing in the morning is terribly difficult and requires more time off work and still does not guarantee you will be seen. Plus it takes all morning to get through and by then the appointments have gone. I am a teacher, taking time off is very difficult and stressful. Today, I have just been told I cannot even have a telephone consultation, as there is no availability and to attend an acute walk in centre in Corby or ring back tomorrow. What if I can’t get to Corby?! What if I’m too unwell to get to Corby?!  Does this happen to elderly patients or people without transport. It’s just so sad and uncaring. I feel sorry for the ladies on reception and this is not a complaint to anyone personally. But it really is dreadful service and completely unacceptable. Lastly, a review of my repeat prescription was completely missed. I rang to chase it up and get a blood test sorted but I was rudely told to wait to be contacted by them. I waited.  Four months later, I had still not heard anything, so I’ve left a message on my app. Thankfully, I have now had a blood test but again, terrible service.

Here are my reasons: 1). Some of the receptionists are rude and in a rush to speak to or answer my questions about appointment bookings (especially on the telephone)  2). I requested to have access of my medical records and test results online but receptionist said I am not allowed (my previous GP allowed me to have access).  Patients should have the right to access their own medical records.  3). One of the nurses and a few doctors does not seem to know what they are doing or talking about or maybe they are in a rush to even bother to establish good patient care and answer patient concerns and questions properly. I didn't have this issue with my previous practice, the doctor there was very kind, open and knowledgeable. 4).  Since I don't feel comfortable with some of the doctors and nurses in the practice, I don't seem to have a freedom of choice to choose which doctor or nurse I want to have an appointment with. 5).  The practice (especially some of the doctors I have encountered) doesn't seem to acknowledge mental health issues. I have mentioned I have anxiety a few times (that could be related to my symptoms) but none of them suggested any form of therapy. I have to find out about talking therapies myself. 6). You cannot book appointments online or on their app even if their website says so. You have to call them at 8am and queue for 20 to 30 minutes. 7).  They sometimes make you stand and wait outside to be let in for face to face appointment.  They should have a system for this or let the patients know what exact time they can check in so that elderly, vulnerable, people with disabilities and pregnant women doesn't have to stand and wait outside for long. The area outside to wait is small that sometimes it gets crowded with people coming in and out the same entrance and there is not enough space for social distancing. They don't have a one way system for COVID precaution unlike other surgeries.\n\nThe only 2 good things about this practice are: 1). The midwife team is really good, caring and understanding. 2). The location is good, there is a good parking space and the practice building, rooms and sitting area are spacious and clean.

I owe the wonderful resus team a huge debt of gratitude not only for their emergency treatment but for communicating  at regular intervals with my husband. I was admitted via an ambulance at approximately 6.30 AM on 6th January and have no recollection of events until I awoke hours later in Intensive Care. To each and every member of staff that responded to my medical needs so swiftly, efficiently and with such professional skill and competence - saying thank you sounds rather hollow. At a human level my natural instinct is to give each of you a big hug: [ being 75 years old I think I could get away with that]. You are faceless individuals to me and yet I feel a deep personal connection with you- Your compassion and whatever words you expressed to me on that remarkable day in my life has made its mark in my heart. \nMay the warmth of this message from myself and my adoring family help to sustain you in all the medical emergencies you face.\nYours affectionately \nJoan Wellington [Joannie]","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2021-07-05T12:34:40","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-07-05T18:33:05","readBy":[{"name":"Barts Health NHS Trust","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/860196","id":"860196"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/860196/responses","id":"860196"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/860196/healthservices","id":"860196"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/860196/tags","id":"860196"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/r1hkh","id":"R1HKH","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency","id":"emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/face","id":"face"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/heart","id":"heart"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/intensive%20care","id":"intensive care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/memory","id":"memory"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gratitude","id":"gratitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wonderful","id":"wonderful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/saved","id":"saved"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/860643","id":"860643"}]},{"id":860203,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Great practice","body":"All reception staff are friendly, professional, patient and knowledgeable. \n\nAll doctors and nurses are approachable and thorough. They use their listening skills to understand the problem enabling them to make an informed decision going forward. Referrals are always very prompt. \nIt’s brilliant also that so many additional services are offered at the practice eg blood tests, ultrasounds, skin biopsies \n\nThe facilities are super clean and social distance systems are excellent. I always feel safe and protected. \n\nObviously the practice is under pressure since the pandemic but the staff and systems in place make getting an appointment relatively easy. \nI think the telephone consultation is brilliant. This determines whether you need a face to face appointment. Pre pandemic I think perhaps time was wasted actually seeing a physician when a telephone consultation could have saved time for both patient and GP. \n\nThis is the third practice I have belonged to in Luton and Larkside is more than head and shoulders above. \n\nYou all do a fantastic job and offer a brilliant service. \n\nI have no hesitation in recommending Larkside.
