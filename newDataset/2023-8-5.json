I had to keep drinking water but the machine was broken and staff had to keep filling two jugs. They apologised but this added to their workload. \r\nManagement please take note.\r\nThe complainers had now disappeared.  Within 15 mins I was called into a room for my scan which involved pumping a saline solution into my arm and filling my bladder before resting for ten minutes. The radiographer explained how I would feel and never left me alone in the room keeping me informed.\r\nI only waited about five minutes before the cannula was removed gently. Thank you.

I had experienced a traumatic event in October 2022 falling 40 meters down a ravine in Snowdonia and was finding it difficult to move on. I was experiencing nightmares and flashbacks and ruminating about the accident and the injuries that I had sustained. I was unable to get back to normal life and work and feeling increasingly isolated as I avoided social situations where I might be asked about the accident.\r\n\r\nMy therapist was excellent. She explained to me the process of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) in a way that was easy to understand. She was empathic, kind and patient, which is so necessary when emotionally vulnerable. She allowed me time to discuss my concerns. \r\n\r\nAs part of the CBT, we practiced 'Reliving’. With my eyes closed and talking in the first person as if I was experiencing the fall for the first time, I talked about what had happened to me. I also recorded it. Although distressing, I was given encouragement and a longer session to do this in a safe manner. Both my therapist and I identified a list of hotspots that had caused me distress. We then went through a structured plan, about what I was thinking at the time, what I feared would happen to me, what the real outcome was, and how I could remind myself of this real outcome. I thought about these points as I listened to the tape again many times. \r\n\r\nThis process was extraordinarily helpful. Up until then intrusive frightening thoughts and memories of the event would jump out and derail me at unexpected times and would often keep me awake. Breaking down the traumatic event into sections allowed me to process what had happened to me in a logical way. Initially I felt overwhelmed when listening to my recording, but with time this lessened to the point that eventually the tape even became boring!\r\n\r\nI found myself coming to terms and processing and accepting what had happened to the point that it became a memory, rather than something that intruded every day.\r\n \r\nUnfortunately, during the last few weeks of treatment I experienced another near-death traumatic incident. I am quite sure that the skills I learnt during my therapy that I applied during this trauma, kept me calm and contributed to my 8% chance of survival.  I am indebted to my therapist at Mind Matters.\r\n\r\nI am also sure that with this second trauma I can use the skills that I have learnt to prevent me getting PTSD from this event. \r\n\r\nI have also learnt so much about myself through this process. I have learnt to be kind to myself and look forward positively about the things I can do, rather than the things that I now can't. These skills will help me to embrace an optimistic and positive future, something that in my darkest hour I never thought I would achieve again.\r\nI cannot recommend Mind Matters more. I am so lucky to have been treated with such professionalism, kindness, and empathy, thank you so much.\r\n","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2023-08-05T13:19:26","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2023-08-05T13:27:42","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1100795","id":"1100795"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1100795/responses","id":"1100795"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1100795/healthservices","id":"1100795"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1100795/tags","id":"1100795"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rxx1y","id":"RXX1Y","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/distressing","id":"distressing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/isolated","id":"isolated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20listened%20to","id":"not listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cbt","id":"cbt"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cognitive%20behavioural%20therapy","id":"cognitive behavioural therapy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/death","id":"death"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/eyes","id":"eyes"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/indebted","id":"indebted"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lucky","id":"lucky"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/memory","id":"memory"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/more%20positive","id":"more positive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/normal","id":"normal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/optimistic","id":"Optimistic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/overwhelmed","id":"overwhelmed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/positive","id":"positive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ptsd","id":"ptsd"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/safe","id":"safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20lucky","id":"very lucky"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vulnerable","id":"vulnerable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/calm","id":"calm"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20safe","id":"very safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/in%20the%20way","id":"in the way"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/listened%20to","id":"listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/feared","id":"feared"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/injuries","id":"injuries"}]},{"id":1100794,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Great practice","body":"Attended with hubby Chris,im 78 and was nervous.

is a brilliant hospital kind and caring ","body":"went to burnley hospital had polyps removed on 04/08/2023  and everyone from the cleaners and domestics and receptionists nurses doctors consultants were so helpfull and kind and caring and from my arrival and first  seeing the receptionists it was only 5 mins later that a nurse took me to the endoscomy ward she was so kind and helpfull she answered all my questions to perfection giving me so much useful information I told her I did not want any pain relief or sedation she said if I wanted or needed any pain relief or  gas and air  I could still have it in case I changed my mind, then when I was in theatre she sat by me and held my hand and she kept me so reassured and feeling safe asking if I was OK then the doctor who performed the endoscopy was so brilliant I never asked for or needed any pain relief or sedation or gas and air because  I was never in pain and the only discomfort was when he put c02 in its like feeling bloated and feeling like you need to pass wind  I think the c02 is so he has more room to take out the polyps and see everything more clear, and as I watched everything he was doing on the big tv monitor it took my mind of any discomfort and it helped  the time go by so quickly then after I was took to the ward and given a nice cup of tea and a nice sandwich then another kind nurse told me everything I needed to know and about things like how there could be blood leaking for a while from the procedure but if there is a lot like half a cup full I would need to ring some contact numbers  and she gave me even more really good advice as well,  so anyone having any doubts about having any polyps removed please go to burnley hospital you will be treated like a friend rather than just a number I am 71 years old and been to many hospitals like preston royal and chorley but burnley is by far the the best by a country mile so thank you burnley hospital  for really caring about my feelings of trepidation and making me feel safe and treating me like a friend may God bless you all for the wonderful kindness and  service you gave to me I wish you all good health and happiness in your precious lives for the years ahead kind regards jimmy","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2023-08-05T19:35:31","progress":"Story has a

I work and pay taxes in this country, I even work for the nhs myself and then to get to the assessment area and waited patiently for a Dr for 5 hours get seen and reviewed and then the Dr has to then speak to their senior to know how to deal with my case, waited for 1hour. When I then saw the Dr and just asked if there was any update. I get a attitude 'the Dr is with a sick patient' because I believe now I am being judged because the Dr don't feel my problem is big. Was it so difficult to come back 10minutes after you said you will speak to your senior and say my colleague is really busy at the moment so It may take a while, so I am seeing other people as you will have to wait. What has happened to communication. Then I see another patient older than me in pain so I ask if the patient had something for then pain and they had not even helped this older person, the patient had their own pain medication and as they was unable to walk I got them some water so they could help themselves to take their own tablets and then I went to the nursing desk to alert the nurse in charge and was dismissive 'oh they are all getting tablets' then the nurse turned back to the computer and chatting to the computer and ignored me when I was making them aware the patient had taken some painkillers so they could document. \r\n\r\nI understand there is pressure, in jobs but if you don't feel the compassion and care to people then why do the job, that is all apart of the experience of feeling better. People showing empathy can ease patients when in that already stressful environment. \r\n\r\nI am not saying all the staff are like that but there are a few amongst them and they need to communicate more effectively, people have to wait but explain to them. Advise them you will be number 30 in the line, when you go round to the assessment area you are just told to sit down and wait. They have a line system which they are aware which patients are next based on checking in, why can they not tell people at least they have something. Then you see them and say your going to get back to them, just inform the patient that whilst you are waiting, for their stuff they will be seeing others in between.  So people are well informed. They just treat people inhumane no proper communication, it was so sad to sit there and watch. Especially the older patient we was there the same time and no one offered a drink of water nothing. The service is extremely poor I am so sorry to say that and that job is not for people that cannot work under pressure because they start to treat people like they are a burden. A lot of Dr's and nurses lack compassion. The love of helping people and treating people with kindness is gone its just a job very sad.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2023-08-05T08:44:17","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2023-08-05T20:30:26","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1100881","id":"1100881"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1100881/responses","id":"1100881"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1100881/healthservices","id":"1100881"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1100881/tags","id":"1100881"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rj122","id":"RJ122","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ignored","id":"ignored"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sad","id":"sad"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/better","id":"better"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/burden","id":"burden"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helped","id":"helped"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/in%20pain","id":"in pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/informed","id":"informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/judged","id":"judged"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lack%20of%20compassion","id":"lack of compassion"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/painkillers","id":"painkillers"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stressful","id":"stressful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20ease","id":"at ease"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doing%20well","id":"doing well"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/like%20a%20burden","id":"like a burden"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20judged","id":"not judged"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/under%20pressure","id":"under pressure"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20at%20ease","id":"not at ease"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/like%20myself","id":"like myself"}]},{"id":1100884,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Great Service","body":"Can t fault the service given.\r\nStaff were excellent, nothing was to much trouble. \r\nKept well informed throughout the stay, and everything was explained clearly.\r\nFood was great to, just an excellent service\r\nCan t thank you enough.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2023-08-05T08:42:55","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-08-05T20:31:10","readBy":[{"name":"Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1100884","id":"1100884"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1100884/responses","id":"1100884"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1100884/healthservices","id":"1100884"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1100884/tags","id":"1100884"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rwp01","id":"RWP01","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/informed","id":"informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doing%20well","id":"doing well"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20great","id":"not great"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1102420","id":"1102420"}]},{"id":1100885,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Confused","body":"Seems like doctor does no prep on why they are calling me and seem to have no idea how to use technology so can't see blood test results \r\n\r\nI find baffling why it takes months for a gp to abllod test and results reviewed.

I have been able to get appointments relatively promptly and received excellent support from clinicians who clearly are very knowledgeable and empathetic. The support staff have been equally helpful - particularly on my most recent visit where I was unfortunately late - whilst patently my own fault, the lady at reception was in no way rude - despite being well within her rights to be so, especially when our GP services are so stretched. The GP was equally understanding and just reinforces the excellent service I've had from this practice.\r\n\r\nI've had medication dispensed and the dispensary could not be any more helpful. I've been patients at other practices in the past, but they've in the whole been inferior experiences to those had at Peninsula Practice.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2023-08-04T12:01:32","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2023-08-05T20:58:07","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1100893","id":"1100893"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1100893/responses","id":"1100893"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1100893/healthservices","id":"1100893"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1100893/tags","id":"1100893"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/d83054","id":"D83054","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doing%20well","id":"doing well"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/in%20the%20way","id":"in the way"}]},{"id":1100892,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Absolutely disgusting service ","body":"We ordered our medication nearly a week  ago and still they have not even put the request through to the GP.

I do think,however, the new booking system is appalling. You can longer go to the surgery to make an appointment...although the receptionist will fill in the form for you I don’t think this is acceptable as it doesn’t actually make the appointment. Not everyone has access to either a computer or smart phone which makes this system useless to them. From my point of view it was much better when you could book an appointment online or actually speak to a person and not have to wait more than an hour hanging on to be told you were number 3 in the queue and having to wait a further 45 mins before being put through. I appreciate it’s a new system which it will take time to get used to but don’t feel it’s a very acceptable system. As I said before I have no complaints against the staff just the system.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2023-08-05T08:01:06","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-08-05T20:59:22","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1100891","id":"1100891"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1100891/responses","id":"1100891"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1100891/healthservices","id":"1100891"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1100891/tags","id":"1100891"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/f81122","id":"F81122","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appalling","id":"appalling"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/better","id":"better"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/much%20better","id":"much better"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1101877","id":"1101877"}]},{"id":1100902,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Adequate practice ","body":"Was seen on the day I needed the appointment which was made online and I find it is too difficult to make a telephone appointment ","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2023-08-04T12:06:34","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2023-08-05T21:01:26","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1100902","id":"1100902"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1100902/responses","id":"1100902"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1100902/healthservices","id":"1100902"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1100902/tags","id":"1100902"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/c83040","id":"C83040","score":null}]},{"id":1100901,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"I recommend this practice","body":"Called at 08:00, was No.21 in queue after just 10 minutes, got through to a lovely receptionist, she was very efficient.
