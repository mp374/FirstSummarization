No question was too ridiculous and I was actively encouraged to seek help when I needed it. Two spells of reduced movements and the midwives could not have been more amazing (even very late one Saturday night!).  \r\nMy midwife Kirsty was absolutely wonderful - extremely knowledgeable, caring and she made me feel that she invested very much in my care - I certainly wasn’t just another number on her case load. Every midwife I came into contact with in Oban was absolutely lovely - I cannot praise the Unit highly enough. Women really looking out for other women during, what can be, a worrying time. Just wonderful.  \r\nScans were regular due to my age and the gestational size of the baby and the sonographer Lorraine could not have been nicer or more professional.  \r\nMy baby girl was born with midwives Sheila and Kirsty. Again, no praise high enough for the care and support I received - I am incredibly grateful for the positive experience which was night and day compared with the birth of my twins. You feel quite special giving birth here because you are so well looked after.  \r\nCare afterwards has been excellent. I’ve felt very supported with regular visits and good advice. Lots of support and help with breast feeding too which has gotten me off to a great start.  \r\nThe whole experience, from the first appointment to the last has been fantastic and I feel incredibly lucky. A massive thank you to the Oban midwives!!

Hated my experience there. They don't actually help you unless your 'severe' which even then all they really do is put you in an impatient and then send you back out. The workers are horrible and inconsiderate as well. I've been told many things from crisis team and camhs like \"it's only superficial\" or \"it's just hormones\" which was extremely invalidating as i really did want help at the time but it seemed like i was the only one that wanted to help myself. Camhs also struggle getting information correct if it doesn't fit their needs to get the session done with. And you would think crisis team would be open for call or referral appointments 24/7 because it is the suicide team that helps with things like that. But i was so shocked when i was told it closes at 9am and opens at 10am. I don't think any child or teenager is going to put a suicide on hold. But of course to fit camhs needs it seems totally appropriate. Overall never would ever say anything good about it but everyone's experiences are different so who knows. 1/10 merely because it made ME look into the mental health part of psychology and do read to help myself which i don't even think i should of been doing when there's people getting degrees for it and paid.

They do some great things but don’t always rise to the challenge of making improvements as timely as they could, innovation is slow. Technology is not their forte. Some wonderful staff at all levels and the odd bad ones who tend not to stick around for too long. However recent(ish) new practice partner additions and salaried gps seem to be working to a diffident patient care agenda than the other longer established staff making it in my opinion a less responsive, patient centric and caring practice. At recent times it’s been rather unpleasant and difficult to deal with. There is a lack a willingness to support patients with poor service received from the secondary care providers and the wider NHS making it a real struggle, almost to the point of  them refusing to recognise and deny the existence of the wider failings. Reviews of surrounding gp practices don’t seem enticing enough to jump ship so we are forced to remain, better the devil you know, and put up with an increasingly poor service rather than no service. Patients shouldn’t be held to ransom by poor primary care provider options. Just because you don’t seem to be the worst in the area doesn’t mean you should not try to address shortcomings and make improvements.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-02-25T10:33:32","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-02-25T14:17:08","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/919573","id":"919573"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/919573/responses","id":"919573"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/919573/healthservices","id":"919573"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/919573/tags","id":"919573"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/f83652","id":"F83652","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/great","id":"great"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wonderful","id":"wonderful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1065754","id":"1065754"}]},{"id":919572,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Getting better ","body":"I have struggled to get in contact or make appointments during the last few years which I understand is part of the pandemic however this has started to get better and they are very good at being through when doing bloods and ensuring me and my child are well and have what we need.

This came as a huge shock as I had utterly convinced myself it was only a cyst and hadn't really expected the worst!  \r\nI was scared and fearing the worst but my consultant Ms McLean and the Breast nurses at Stobhill were just amazing! Ms Mclean could not be any more perfect for her role and what she does! She just makes you feel like a friend, like she truly cares and that you really matter to her! Complete empathy and sincerity at all times you really do feel better each time you speak to her regardless as to what awful news she's having to give you.I was lucky. IF you can use that word! In that I was graded stage 1, my cancer was small and although I did require surgery and radiotherapy I avoided Chemo! So far I've had my lumpectomy and sentinel node biopsy and have to say, the wait for results is the scariest part of all of that! The surgery was fine, staff cared for me well and the overnight stay comfortable and as nice as a stay in hospital can be! I recovered well and quickly and was back to work in 3 days and the gym in a week. Although I do not advise that to everyone, I just believe you know your own body and its capabilities! I'm now waiting on, and most likely due any day now, to begin Radiotherapy. This doesn't scare me as much as the medication which to be honest I have yet to start and I'm awaiting a call back to discuss this further as I'm just not convinced that it's the best course of action for me personally.I'm grateful or all the care and patience I've received this far and I am SO grateful, that I was lucky enough to fall into the care of Ms McLean and her team.

He was assessed promptly by the nursing and medical team and the families anxieties were listened to and acted upon. He had a full physio, occupational therapy and speech and language assessment and ECHO examination all on the same day.

We were all devastated. Very quickly she was started on a treatment plan with included surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy.  \r\nShe had a PICC line inserted and was referred to a local team of nurses in Omagh called the rapid response nursing team. This team would become so central to mum's treatment and end of life pathway.  \r\nThey dressed her PICC line weekly and reserved her bloods, if she needed a blood transfusion they provided this close to our home. It was the loveliest environment the clinical care centre where mum was treated with such dignity, respect and above all else she felt like she was part of an additional family. Mum got to know all the nurses and ancillary staff. They treated her with the highest standards of care and attention.  \r\nMum did not get good news after her treatment was complete unfortunately the cancer had spread and she quickly became palliative. What was so personal and lovely was these nurses whom she got to know were now caring for her in her own home providing intravenous antibiotics, symptom relief and support for the family.  \r\nThe most amazing part was mum knew them all, she felt that she had her family caring for her at the end of her life. The whole family were so comfortable that this amazing team had been with us on our journey from the beginning of mum's disease and were now here at the end of her life.  \r\nIf I could plan end of life care for anyone I would place this team at the forefront and I would want the experience we had for any family going through this very difficult time. We have to say the rapid response nursing team were pivotal to mum's care and to have the same team from beginning to end was so special.  \r\nWe cannot recommend this highly skilled and dedicated team enough. May the service they provide continue to grow and flourish and may the Western trust be so proud they have developed such a wonderful service. We will always remember the nurses who cared for mum so fondly.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-02-23T21:32:43.5766667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-02-25T16:00:04.697","readBy":[{"name":"Western Health and Social Care Trust","count":11},{"name":"Public Health Agency","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/919111","id":"919111"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/919111/responses","id":"919111"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/919111/healthservices","id":"919111"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/919111/tags","id":"919111"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt005-rrt-omagh","id":"zt005-rrt-omagh","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/antibiotics","id":"antibiotics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood","id":"blood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20transfusion","id":"blood transfusion"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cancer","id":"cancer"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/chemotherapy","id":"chemotherapy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/continuity%20of%20care","id":"continuity of care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/end%20of%20life","id":"end of life"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/endometrial%20cancer","id":"endometrial cancer"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/expertise","id":"expertise"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/palliative","id":"palliative"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/radiotherapy","id":"radiotherapy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20relieved","id":"very relieved"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confident","id":"confident"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dignity","id":"Dignity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thankful","id":"Thankful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/picc%20line","id":"picc line"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing%20team","id":"amazing team"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/920066","id":"920066"}]},{"id":919327,"author":"Farzana","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Care from A&E and Ophthalmology Dept","body":"I was visiting N. Devon when Shingles affected my trigeminal nerve. My eye was painful and the rash was around my eye. A GP on holiday drove me 30mls to Barnstaple. A&E were excellent with the triage nurse asking if I needed paracetamol - a kind thought. The doctor I saw did some tests and liaised with Ophthamology. They worked out 'a plan' for me. I was asked to return two days later when I saw a consultant from Ophthamolgy. I could not have received better treatment, care, consideration and kindness. I was only sorry I was unable to return to the N.
