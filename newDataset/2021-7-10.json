Being transfered to the actual ward is where my care went rapidly downhill. I was told by staff on the triage was that once I got onto the ward staff would monitor my child administering oxygen as and when required. Once transfered to the ward in the middle of the night I was left with my child attached to the monitor, for it to bleep for over an hour before I had to press the buzzer for the staff nurse to come and check my child's observations. This was reoccurrence throughout the night where no staff came to the monitor bleeping, most nurses sat around the nurse station having a good laugh and joke and ignoring all monitors bleeping. I am not medically trained but felt I needed to be to make decisions around oxygen for my child's care due to the lack of support from the nurses on the ward. Support needs to be given rather than nurses expecting the parent to know whats best.

It is a concern that as a provider of healthcare the staff on reception were not wearing masks correctly and setting an example to people using the service.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2021-07-10T09:16:37","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2021-07-10T20:26:32","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/861803","id":"861803"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/861803/responses","id":"861803"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/861803/healthservices","id":"861803"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/861803/tags","id":"861803"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/b84004","id":"B84004","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/concern","id":"concern"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/concerned","id":"concerned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good","id":"good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20good","id":"not good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20concerned","id":"very concerned"}]},{"id":861806,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Absolutely brilliant ","body":"I rang 111 at 8:44 this morning (Saturday) in severe discomfort from a bladder/ kidney infection.\nMy call was triaged very efficiently, I was told to expect a callback within 6 hours.\nAt 8:55 I got the promised call, nurse took further details and said I would need to speak to out of hours GP, expect a call within 6 hours.\n10:34 I received the promised call from a very friendly GP,  a few questions and history taking and was asked if I would like a prescription sent to my nominated pharmacy, I said “yes, when would they receive it”.\n“It’s there now” she said.\nAs my local Boots is only a short walk, my partner was there and back by 11am and the first dose was administered.\n\nLess than 2 hours especially in this current crisis is unbelievably good, very very happy with the service I received 👍❤️\n\n","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2021-07-10T13:41:29","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2021-07-10T20:36:03","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/861806","id":"861806"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/861806/responses","id":"861806"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/861806/healthservices","id":"861806"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/861806/tags","id":"861806"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/ntp","id":"NTP","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/crisis","id":"crisis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bladder","id":"bladder"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good","id":"good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/infection","id":"infection"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kidney","id":"kidney"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20good","id":"not good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pharmacy","id":"Pharmacy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happy","id":"happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20happy","id":"not happy"}]},{"id":861805,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Outstanding service","body":"Appointment went to private imaging of which I left messages that I wanted it at the GUEST .. failure of private to even return my calls & their communication was incorrect.

The longest I waited was an hour and forty five minutes (as it was urgent) to then have them cancel the call. This was not at peak times 8.30 am / 2pm). It shouldn’t take this long to speak to someone.  \r\nI can only assume that reception don’t man the phones in a normal way. I appreciate they may have other responsibilities in the practice but communication with patients is absolutely key and will put people off trying to see their doctor. Once you do get through I have found the person on reception helpful and polite but this service is just not good enough.  \r\nI have only dealt with two of the doctors, one them really listened to my medical issues but the other had no bedside manner unfortunately.

AT 2: 30am the pain was so bad I could not cope. I attended A& E and this was a bad and horrible experience as I was informed they were understaffed for the night duty, it was almost half the number of staff they would have during the day.  \r\nI was then transferred from A& E up to here on 4 North and have since been told I have a gallbladder infection. The staff here are all great and is a big difference from casualty. Unfortunately for myself I haven't made much improvement and I would be in agony if it weren't for the drugs they are giving me.  \r\nI have had 3 days of IV antibiotics and painkillers which are strong but don't seem to be doing the job. I also have a high temperature at the moment.  \r\nIf I could suggest an improvement it would be the flow of information from the doctors to myself as I have only been able to speak to them once since I have been here. there was a mistake with my scan which was accidentally booked as an outpatient instead of an inpatient for me. This then ended up delaying things which wasn't great.  \r\nI feel like there was miscommunication from doctors to myself and I have no clue at times what is going on. I have noticed a difference in the nursing levels too of the permanent vs the temporary staff and this seems an inefficient way to run a ward.

I went to my dentist who referred me to the hospital to see about jaw surgery (this was January last year) of course after that we had the pandemic so services have been delayed. I got a letter in for an appointment for July 2021. The letter states how I will need x rays and this appointment will take up to 2 hours. When I came into the hospital at the ENT reception a receptionist had no mask on! Then when I got seen you were lucky I was only there for 10 minutes and was a check up! The consultant gave me information which I already knew about and said they have a major back log and not to mention there has been no surgeon since before the pandemic. So I’ve to get x rays and molds done which will take another year ! It’s beyond a joke! Another waiting list- seriously ! It’s not like at this stage I need a surgeon to put braces on me! This is really affecting my mental health I have a jaw which clicks, jaw pain, over lapped teeth which makes me feel self conscious - I don’t want to smile because of it.

We had a number of midwifes allocated to us from LMU due to unforeseen circumstances relating to sickness absence and people leaving which resulted in a lack of consistency in care up until 33 weeks of pregnancy. This had quite a knock on effect being a first time mum (all the questions!) - having to explain situation multiple times, and a lack of structure, organisation (missed appointment at 31 weeks!) and no communication from 21 weeks until 33 weeks (coupled by no antenatal classes due to covid) contributed to an anxious time.  \r\nHowever when care was taken by over by midwifes Brenda and Lorna at 33 weeks we could not of asked for more supportive, on the ball midwifes - who have gone over and above the duty of care - from 33 weeks to our postnatal discharge. We are so grateful to for their support, knowledge and reassurance during the pregnancy and the weeks thereafter. Both midwifes are highly skilled professionals and made our experience extremely positive and gave the tools we needed to prepare for labour.  \r\nI was scheduled for an induction at the RAH last week due to a growth scan flagging that our baby's growth may be tailing off and I had had an episode of reduced movement. From being admitted to triage and then to Ward 31B for induction the process was very smooth - we felt properly informed to be able to make a choice on induction. My experience of being on Ward 31B (before and after birth) was extremely positive, the midwifes there are so caring and attentive. I would like to mention midwifes Dawn, Stacey and Robyn who supported me and provided first class care before and after my very quick labour.  \r\nMy labour in total lasted just over 1 hour after a third successful pessary! I started getting very strong contractions on the antenatal ward which resulted in a quick transfer to the labour ward. I had requested a VE on the antenatal ward but as the labour ward had requested I move down to room 2 quickly - it was decided that the staff on the labour ward would perform this. I was in quite a lot of pain and distress by the time I arrived in Room 2, however no VE was performed and I was told that I was 2CM dilated, which I couldn't understand due to the level of pain. However I was a first time mum and trusted that this was the case.  \r\nDue to this fact I had requested an epidural asap to help me cope to which I was told that the anaesthetist was busy in the next room with another woman. My partner became increasingly agitated as I was becoming more in more in distress with the pain and the sister at the time would not communicate openly as to what the situation was with the epidural. It was as if we kept being palmed off for another \"15 mins\" as the anaesthetist was busy with \"more important woman\" who had been in labour for 4 hours. It was only when I suddenly got the urge to push that a proper VE was performed and I was told I was 10cm dilated and ready to go?!  \r\nThis lack of communication as to what stage of labour I was in and and attitude of the sister created additional anxiety and stress to what was already a very emotive time. It also mentally affected my ability to labour confidently as my body was clearly at a different stage to what I was being verbally told. I held back in the pushing phase having been told I was only 2cm which increased my pain massively. I felt that my partner was not listened to as he advocated for me to have some sort of pain relief and I was let down as a result of one sisters attitude and incompetency.  \r\nDuring the pushing phase my partner was told by the sister that he was not allowed to film the birth and told to put his phone away- we have since been advised that this is allowed as long as midwifes are not filmed, however that moment has now passed. After the birth I was getting stitched for a second degree tear which was extremely painful but the sister thought it was appropriate to keep taking a cold tone and attitude with me to sit on my bum and not move (really difficult after just having given birth and now getting stitched).  \r\nWe cannot fault the second midwife who also assisted the birth and to be quite honest if it had just been her I think our experience would have been much more positive. She was brilliant and caring and really looked after the three of us after the birth and we give our thanks to her for this. It is a shame that one person's poor attitude, aggressive tone with my partner and coldness tainted the birth of our daughter. I would ask that they are given additional training with respect to communication, empathy, dealing with stressful situations and the way she treats the staff who assist her, it did not go unnoticed.  \r\nOverall we feel that we had a positive experience with both the Lochgilphead and Paisley Maternity Units, there are huge unsung heroes in each of the services we used which include, midwives, auxiliaries, cleaners, security guards, paediatricians (Brian). However the lack of communication is something that I think clearly needs addressed and I hope this feedback is helpful in providing insight into my experience as a first time mum within the

When I arrived I was told to sit in the car for over an hour. I phoned them and they said I just have to wait. I was concerned that I was in labour when I was meant to be having a C-section. They really didn't speak to me nicely at all. The hospital should employ people that are empathetic and polite on the phone for this job. I was panicking and they made it worse.  \r\nThe nurses in the delivery suite and on this ward are amazing. The doctors are really good too. They have kept me up to date on everything that is going on.  \r\nIt is really warm on this ward and we aren't allowed to open the windows. I am sweating a lot. We aren't allowed to bring in fans unfortunately.  \r\nUnfortunately the food menu has changed from the last time I was here. It is a much shorter menu with not much of a variety. I understand that this may be because of the covid situation. The vegetable soup is nice.  \r\nVisiting is a tough topic. I understand that sisters/brothers or grandparents etc aren't able to visit however, I think our partner should be able to stay with us especially when we need them. I had a section and am very sore. I have to ring the buzzer each time I need to move my baby etc whereas if my partner was here with me he could do this instead. It does get very lonely. It isn't nice being alone when you have just had a new baby.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-07-09T17:57:46.9866667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-07-12T09:20:06.797","readBy":[{"name":"Southern Health and Social Care Trust","count":4}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/861569","id":"861569"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/861569/responses","id":"861569"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/861569/healthservices","id":"861569"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/861569/tags","id":"861569"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_32024-2-west","id":"zt003_32024-2-west","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_32024-maternity-admission","id":"zt003_32024-maternity-admission","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/alone","id":"alone"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing%20staff","id":"amazing staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/concerned","id":"concerned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/delivery","id":"delivery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctor","id":"doctor"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/empathy","id":"empathy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/food%20choice","id":"food choice"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kept%20informed","id":"kept informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/labour","id":"labour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/maternity","id":"maternity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/partner%20accommodation","id":"partner accommodation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/polite","id":"polite"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/temperature","id":"temperature"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/visiting","id":"visiting"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting%20time","id":"waiting time"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/well%20informed","id":"well informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/too%20warm","id":"too warm"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/863284","id":"863284"}]},{"id":861946,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Kind, caring and helpful staff","body":"I have always found the staff here are highly professional and caring.
