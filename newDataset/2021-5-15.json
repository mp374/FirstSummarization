The practice is run extremely efficiently and communication via text message throughout the pandemic has been much appreciated. The practice really has put a lot of thought into providing an efficient service that remains very patient centred, and have provided face to face assessment for me and my family when it has been needed.

I’m not that old but the on line procedure is not easy and must be very difficult for some people to use. I have no idea where all the five star reviews come from. I tried to ring the practice at 3 pm yesterday and phone was answered gone 4 o’clock.I was redirected to Katie Rd. I rang Katie Rd straight after who told me they were full and not taking any more appointments and ring my GP the next day. I’m on the phone again @ 9 am 28 in the queue. 31 minutes later I’m now number five in the queue... This is not five stars \nI wouldn’t mind but this was like this pre covid but now possibly worse","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2021-05-13T08:40:37","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-05-15T16:50:54","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/846726","id":"846726"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/846726/responses","id":"846726"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/846726/healthservices","id":"846726"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/846726/tags","id":"846726"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/y00159","id":"Y00159","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid","id":"covid"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%2019","id":"covid 19"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/847272","id":"847272"}]},{"id":846725,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Can't fault this gp surgery!","body":"I have been registered with this GP practice for over 20 years now and within the last year I have had nothing but continued support and care and great empathy not only from my GP but also other members of staff at this practice.

My first Covid Jab was on a Saturday in January 2021 and I arrived early and joined a short queue and was then asked when my app was and told to go in. All was quick and efficient.  My 2nd Jab was on a Thursday-therefore I needed to take time off work - I arrived early and joined a very long queue that stretched up the road and around into another road.  Eventually I was seen over 20 mins after the scheduled appointment.   Really happy to have received my vaccination and the NHS staff were very good but not as well organized this time.

I emailed the surgery, reported my result & asked for antibiotics. The surgery replied on Wednesday asking me some questions, which I answered. On Maundy Thursday in the middle of the day (I was at work) the surgery emailed me asking me to bring in a urine sample by 1300 hours “for the nurse to check”. Of course I was unable to do so. The surgery was then closed until the Tuesday after Easter. Just before 1500 hours on the Tuesday after Easter I took a urine sample to the surgery and was told that I was too late. I explained that I had had an infection for a week, had not been able to get there earlier in the day and suggested that surely there was someone on the premises who could test the urine and prescribe appropriately. The staff member said she would see what she could do and would ring me later. The very polite staff member did ring me & advised that I would need to bring in another sample before 1300 hours the next day & that the surgery would be open at 0800 hours. I explained that I would be at work and could not attend then. The staff member was adamant that no-one was available at the surgery to help me despite my having had an infection for a week. I enquired as to which day the surgery opened early, so I could get there before work, & was told that the next day of early opening would be the following Monday. I explained that this would mean that I would be waiting 2 weeks for antibiotics in the presence of clear infection & that this is not good practice, with potential for sepsis, but to no avail. On the following Monday, 2 weeks after my initial contact with the surgery regarding this matter, I took in a urine sample. Whilst at the surgery I asked if I could arrange to speak to a Doctor about my elderly mother. I was told “this cannot be done at the window”. I explained that I was not requesting to speak to the Doctor at the window but wanted to make an appointment for a doctor to ring. The staff member was adamant that I must ring in to make an appointment & that she would not be able to help. I duly rang & spent precisely 1 hour waiting for the surgery to answer the telephone. Once the telephone was answered an appointment was arranged swiftly and politely.\n\nI eventually got antibiotics over 2 weeks after my initial contact with surgery & an appointment was arranged for my mother. However, I feel that the overall experience represents incredibly poor patient service. Why turn someone away from a face to face conversation to make them wait on a phone for 1 hour? Why not recognise the importance of dealing with infection swiftly? I urge Monton Medical to consider better training/support of its staff.

The private GP has referred me to a specialist, but Bupa need my NHS GP to complete a short form to authorise this. I rang on Tuesday morning, the receptionist found my email with the required form and asked me to ring back after 15:00 to check on status. I rang back at 15:30 and spoke to the same woman. She had no idea who I was or anything about the form so we had to start again. She said that my form had been sent to the GPs. I asked what time that day they would fill this in (bearing in mind this form requires a few sentences from them only) and she told me they may be able to fill it in by Friday and for me to ring back on Friday. I asked why they couldn't fill it in today and she said she couldn't help me on that point... I rang back on Friday and spoke to the same woman. She had no idea who I was or anything about the form. I had to go through the whole explanation again. She put me on hold for a few minutes and then came back on to say she would ring me back later that day. As expected, she never rang me back. This surgery is one of the worst I have ever experienced. Not only are they continuing to deny me access to a NHS GP, but they now deny me access to a private healthcare too - shame on you! I note that this surgery has replied to all the other negative reviews on this site, but they have not replied to mine - why is that? You have all my details.

The receptionist will just fob you off with any excuse under the sun. I’m not sure if it is the same woman every time but they are extremely rude and do not want to help. The worst surgery I have ever dealt with, I was told to drop a repeat prescription into a box located at the back of the surgery but was not told this box is not accessible at weekends. Every surgery I have had in the past you can call the reception and the repeat could be pushed by the doctor. I work mon-fri 8-6 so people like me have absolutely no way of putting in a repeat prescription. I now have had my condition flare up again as I cannot get my second monthly anti biotic prescribed on my last visit. If there is another way then I was not notified by this rude receptionist she couldn’t wait to get me off the phone. My partner also called in with a bad back and eventually got her to make an appointment after she tried to tell him he had ‘back spasms’. It’s not a one off, there is clearly an unhelpful cycle at this surgery. I have also recently found out I was pregnant.... (unhelpful again when I asked for info from the receptionist) and the only reason I do not swap surgeries is because the assigned midwife is so lovely. However if this is what it is to be for the foreseeable future I will have no choice but to change. Coming from the Old Exchange surgery the Grove Medical has a lot to answer for. I would like to say the doctors and nurses are all so great and really do care for their patients when you finally get to see them just a shame the call time and reception who let the place down.

People with severe mental health problems are left to their own devices, as though these are problems that can be easily fixed with a positive mental attitude. I am always frustrated at the management of our local services, and often find the situation entirely upsetting.
