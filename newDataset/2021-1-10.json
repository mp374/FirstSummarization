They worked tirelessly all day and night and I cannot praise then highly enough.

Thankfully as I was in so much discomfort I was swiftly triaged and after various blood tests I was admitted to AAU. I stayed in purple suite for one night and was transferred to EAU on xmas day! I was very weak as I'd not retained food for over 3 weeks. The staff were gentle and caring and encouraged me to eat. Being xmas there were not many doctors around but nevertheless I felt safe and cared for at all times. On the Sunday after christmas, services started kicking in and I had an xray with another procedure the following day. Tests started in earnest and I was monitored all the time by the wonderful nurses. I ended up being in EAU for a week.  I was broken when I went in but came out repaired and diagnosed with full follow up plan. In all my years I had never spent a night in hospital! This episode came as a complete shock to me but I wanted to record my utmost thanks and appreciation for all the care and attention I received at a time when covid was running rampant through other parts of the hospital.

I ended up waiting 4 hours to be seen and due to covid my mum wasn‚Äôt allowed to wait with me. After 4 hours I was taken to S.A.U and waited another 3.5 hours to be seen by a doctor only to find out that at 11:30 in the evening I was going to be kept in overnight. Credit to the staff in the S.A.U who were friendly and helpful. I was then eventually moved to the ward at 2am and had surgery around roughly 10am. Some staff on the ward were rude and ignored the requests of patients, including myself, leaving me in the dark despite asking on several occasions what was happening. After being discharged on New Year‚Äôs Day at 6pm I was told to return to the urgent treatment centre to get my packing and bandages changed. I did this the following day and found myself waiting another 3 hours to be seen to then be told the packing the hospital had given me was the wrong one. I have found that on further visits to the urgent treatment centre, despite making appointments, there is still a lengthy wait (for example, for when I arrived for one appointment, I waited an hour and a half). Not only this but there have been occasions where there have been so many people gathered in the small space, with very little ventilation not adhering to the 2m social distancing (which is on posters and stickers on the floor around the hospital). I do understand that the NHS is under a lot of pressure but I feel that the waiting times and the attitude of some of the staff is unacceptable.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2021-01-10T16:40:37","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-01-10T19:27:06","readBy":[{"name":"Walsall Healthcare NHS Trust","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/815476","id":"815476"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/815476/responses","id":"815476"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/815476/healthservices","id":"815476"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/815476/tags","id":"815476"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rbk","id":"RBK","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ignored","id":"ignored"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/abscess","id":"abscess"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ventilation","id":"ventilation"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/816008","id":"816008"}]},{"id":815477,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Great practice","body":"Today I broke my wrist.

I have been prescribed strong analgesia for over a decade now for chronic back and hip problems. On numerous occasions I have gone to collect my prescription and there‚Äôs nothing there for me. It is usually sorted within a day or two, but thats 1-2 days with no medication which you should not suddenly withdraw from.  \r\nDuring covid, it has become even harder to collect a prescription while also working for the NHS on the frontline. Doing shifts makes going to the pharmacy difficult and more time consuming considering queues. This is something we all just have to accept and be considerate about. Last month I ordered my prescription 6 days prior to when I would run out. I waited purposely until the last day, knowing how busy GP practice‚Äôs are and pharmacists are. I got there to discover no prescription. This left me with no medication for the next day. I had to take a day off work as I struggle to walk due to the pain.  \r\nThis month I ordered my prescription 8 days early, worried I may end up in the same situation if a problem arose. I waited until the day before I had none only to discover it had not been done again! On enquiry as to why, I was told it was because I ordered it too early this time and there is also a note saying my prescription needs reviewed! I completely understand the need for review, however I dont understand how a patient is supposed to be aware of this , or that its going to leave me without any analgesic until its too late.  \r\nThis is utterly disgraceful! I purposely try not to bother my GP practice as I know how busy they are. Im not sure how ones deals with a situation where appointments are scarce, yet if I dont get one I am left in severe pain. I appreciate reasons why reviews need done, but surely the patient should be made aware a review is needed!  \r\nThis has happened to me so many times, even pre -covid & I never do anything because I work in the NHS and completely understand the pressures. But this is just outrageous! I am extremely angry and upset as I go out my way to try and think of the GP practice and the pharmacy, only to find myself suffering.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-12-16T13:14:00.1933333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-01-11T09:20:00.467","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Ayrshire & Arran","count":8}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/811156","id":"811156"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/811156/responses","id":"811156"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/811156/healthservices","id":"811156"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/811156/tags","id":"811156"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sa9-gp","id":"sa9-gp","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/angry","id":"angry"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disgraceful","id":"Disgraceful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frustrated","id":"frustrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20frustrated","id":"very frustrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20upset","id":"very upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/worried","id":"worried"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back%20pain","id":"back pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/chronic%20back","id":"chronic back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/consideration","id":"consideration"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hip","id":"hip"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pharmacy","id":"Pharmacy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/prescriptions","id":"prescriptions"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/respect","id":"respect"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/run","id":"run"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/walk","id":"walk"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassion","id":"compassion"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/access%20to%20medication","id":"access to medication"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/835568","id":"835568"}]},{"id":814369,"author":"SLeo","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Very rude staff","body":"Been trying to get through to them was hard enough, didn't matter what time of day it was.
