I said I was on the phone now and it was the surgery who had asked me to call and was told it was out of their hands. The lady I spoke to was all very nice and not her fault but now Im left wondering why the need to talk to me knowing that it could be weeks before I get to speak to a Doctor.

With the form only being available during surgery hours, this stops anyone who leaves early for work, spends the day at work, and then travels home, with no opportunity to book an appointment unless they have internet access at work. \n\nWhilst many people have smartphones and laptops, my job often means I don't have an internet connection at the customer site, so I am being made to wait until I am not at work just to be able to book an appointment.\n\nI tried to book an appointment over the phone but the very rude receptionist said I must do this online. When I pointed out that their policy is discriminating against those who do not have online access, the lady was patronising and said \"i'll do it for you once this time, but next time you'll have to do it online\".\n\nThis surgery regularly fails to pick up on important clinical findings, only really choosing to select a course of treatment if it involves them prescribing something, or drug pushing as I call it.\n\nIf you do manage to get an appointment, god help you if you bring more than one thing to the session as you are told off, even though you can't get double appointments.\n\nThe lack of care and compassion seen in the past months with this surgery is appalling. Unfortunately I became frustrated during an appointment because the doctor dismissed my claims. Everything is \"functional\" according to them. When I got a little frustrated I was patronised and said I could be referred for counselling.\n\nNot fit for purpose anymore this surgery, so will be changing.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2023-05-18T19:58:38","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-05-20T18:50:29","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1068791","id":"1068791"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1068791/responses","id":"1068791"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1068791/healthservices","id":"1068791"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1068791/tags","id":"1068791"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/h85101","id":"H85101","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appalling","id":"appalling"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frustrated","id":"frustrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lack%20of%20care","id":"Lack of care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/patronised","id":"patronised"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20frustrated","id":"very frustrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/counselling","id":"counselling"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dismissed","id":"dismissed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/drug","id":"drug"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/get%20fit","id":"get fit"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/important","id":"important"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1069157","id":"1069157"}]},{"id":1068790,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Good experience","body":"I understand the other reviews are very negative, but my experience of this practice has been very good so far.

They just did a urine and blood test. I was then sent home with some medication, which didn't work. First time they said that the gynaecologist had refused to see me (!), second time that they don't have an ultrasound machine (an entire hospital without an ultrasound machine...), and the third time that my problem had now become long-term and I should go to the GP. They basically refused to treat me. Apparently, a woman my age shouldn't expect any better. \nOf course, it goes without saying that a GP cannot deal with such a situation, and is not qualified to do so. As indeed their own GPs in A&E had failed to provide effective treatment.\nNext day the bleeding got into a super heavy flow. 111 said that they are sending an ambulance (from Barnet General). Then they called to say, since the ambulance is too busy can I go to A&E instead? Hell, no, I can't go anywhere, that's why I am calling you. I am a prisoner without a life because you are not treating me. You just take the NHS tax from my salary without asking me and then you neglect my health.\nWhile I was being sent away without any treatment I could see that male patients were being referred for emergency scans.\nAfter I got the bleeding under some control on my own and without the help of anyone here, I flew to Greece to see a gynaecologist urgently privately. He offered to see me and operate at a very short notice after hearing that I'd been bleeding for 2 months non-stop. That is considered an emergency... \nI was seen and operated on the same day. The ultrasound took 2 minutes and the operation 15... Apparently, the bleeding would have carried on for a year at least without the op. \nI got no help and no patient care here. I got treated like a nuisance and like a second-rate patient just for being a woman. The medication prescribed made things worse in the long term. It was only good enough to allow me to board a flight safely to go and see a proper doctor away from Barnet General. There was no interest in my quality of life or well-being. Your doctors are rude and lazy.\nMy best advice to anyone is to not bother with this A&E Department at all. This department here is not up to modern medical standard. It only wastes your time and delays you going to someone that is actually going to treat you. The main objective of Barnet General A&E doctors is to keep their workload down without any interest for the outlook for the patients. They are happy for you to suffer and let your life bleed out of you so that they don't have to do anything about it. They told me they only do blood transfusions and resuscitation. They just don't want you dying on their premises. They don't care if you do in the next hour after you have left the hospital. \nIf it hadn't been for the false hope of treatment here I would have got it much earlier privately. So, use my experience to your own benefit. \nThe best thing that can happen to Barnet General A&E is to close it down.

The dispenser at the entrance door to Channel was empty, and had been for some time. No dispensers were available on the wall racks. I thought hand hygiene for all was important.\nOn Cambridge K, I visited at dinner time and both my friend and the patient in the next bed had their meal tray just left on their side-tables.

We are only allowed to rebook medication 4 days before the reissue date.  Which is what I adhere too and diarise in order not to run out of repeat medication.  Once recorded it should only take 72 hours to reach the pharmacist.  However I have notice that recently that it takes the prescriptions to be signed a week and then it takes another two days for the pharmacy to make up the prescription which in total means a delay of 7 days to obtain once medication.   When I called the surgery today to enquire why my repeat prescription has not yet been sent to the pharmacy to process I was advised that it usually takes a week.  I disagree, in the past my medication was processed within two days but I noticed over the last year things have gone from bad to worse.  I was advised by the reception staff member that they will mark the prescription as urgent and get it sent to the pharmacy today however that it most probably would only be ready by Monday /Tuesday.  Therefore a delay of 7 days to receive my repeat prescriptions and running out of my medication didn’t seem to be of concern.   To sum up, one can’t get to see a doctor at this practise; one’s medication is delayed so I don’t see the function of this practise anymore.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2023-05-19T14:22:01","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2023-05-20T22:14:44","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1068855","id":"1068855"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1068855/responses","id":"1068855"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1068855/healthservices","id":"1068855"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1068855/tags","id":"1068855"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/k82033","id":"K82033","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pharmacy","id":"Pharmacy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/worse%20than%20before","id":"worse than before"}]},{"id":1068854,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Medium","body":"Phoned at 8.30am, 22 in the queue held on for 1 hour 35 minutes then told there were no appointments.

experience ","body":"I’m a 39f with no health problems so when I’m December i got sciatica in my left leg I just though it was a trapped nerve and after a week it felt better but was never the same so after Christmas I called the surgery to see a doctor as the pain in my hip wouldn’t go, of course like the rest of the reviews I could not get an appointment and called throughout the month with no success so in February I spoke to receptionist and told them my problem only to be told very rudely with no compassion or empathy well nothing they can do keep trying, told them the pain is not going it’s getting worse the receptionist did not care at all. So I gave up it’s now may the pain is still in my hip and has now gone to my back as well. I been trying since February on and off to get an appointment with no success so called the receptionist today, to see if the receptionist could tell mehow else I can, I was the phone crying telling this receptionist that I’m getting scared now as all I know this could be cancer, I didn’t get a chance to ask the question as the receptionist was very rude, constantly over talking me, snapping at me telling to call at 8 tomorrow. I don’t write reviews but my experience has been awful, no one has the right no matter ur job title is, to treat people so poorly like there less than people","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2023-05-19T16:52:46","progress":"Story has a

I was informed it had not been sent by the surgery.  I attended the surgery and spoke to the receptionist, who was most helpful, I was informed it had been refused by the pharmacist, no documentation stating why.   I was slightly annoyed by this.  I was advised by the receptionist to contact NHS 111 for an emergency prescription, which I did.  I was also given an appointment to speak to the pharmacist.  I attended another pharmacy to collect the prescription.  I was given 9 tablets for the same price as a 3 month prescription of the same medication.  I was contacted by the pharmacist four days later to discuss the matter.I asked why it had been stopped as my HRT medication had changed to patches.  I don't recall being advised to stop Utrogestan.  The pharmacist advised that I would have to contact the practice nurse to clarify why it had been stopped.  I managed to get a cancellation phone appointment for a couple of days later.  I received an evening call and it was clarified why the medication had been refused.  If I had been aware of why, it would have saved time for all concerned and a great deal of anguish for me.  In all, the process took a week, communication between Practitioner and patient wasn't clear, it was an expense that I didn't need.  Maybe when patients medication is on repeat prescription and it is stopped, an email to inform the patient could be helpful?  Emails are sent to patients regarding other services that are available at your surgery.  Just a thought. \n\n","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2023-05-19T17:39:44","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-05-20T22:27:06","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1068882","id":"1068882"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1068882/responses","id":"1068882"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1068882/healthservices","id":"1068882"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1068882/tags","id":"1068882"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/b85028","id":"B85028","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/annoyed","id":"annoyed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/concerned","id":"concerned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency","id":"emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hrt","id":"hrt"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/informed","id":"informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pharmacy","id":"Pharmacy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20concerned","id":"very concerned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/saved","id":"saved"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20great","id":"not great"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1071655","id":"1071655"}]},{"id":1068881,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"No time!","body":"3 times I've been told by the same GP she doesn't have time to explain my illnesses to me as she is too busy!
