I was asked to carry out a home testing kit on the Friday in preparation for my hospital procedure on the Monday. I was sent the kit along with instructions. The instructions stated that the test should be dropped off at one of the various location within an hour of completing the test and to also drop off before 10am that day, which I did.  \r\nOn the Saturday I got a call from the hospital questioning whether I had done the test or not which was rather worrying. It seemed the test had somehow gone missing.  \r\nI was asked to go to the drive through Covid test station at Barnstaple, that day to complete a 2nd test. The staff member (Sarah) I spoke to on the phone was very helpful and went above and beyond to help me. The other staff member (Kirsty) at the testing centre was also super helpful, so thank you for that.  \r\nLuckily both test results came back negative and I was able to have my procedure carried out on the Monday as planned.  \r\nMy questions are: as there was little information on what the procedure is if a test does go missed, would it not be a good idea to make it clearer to patients that in this unlikely event the 2nd test will be prioritised so not to hold up any forth coming procedure or appointments?  \r\nI felt I had to push a little bit to find out if the test results would be back in time and after waiting so ,long for the actual procedure in the first place it would have been such a shame if it couldnt have gone ahead.  \r\nMy other question is why are some patients given a home testing kit and some sent to the drive through, what are the distinctions and reasons for which type of test a patient is allocated?  \r\nMy final thought is, the instructions that came through with the home testing kit stated to drop off the same day before 10am then on the bottom of the same page it stated 11am, has this not been proof read? I feel this could be quite misleading to some people.  \r\nThank you again to all the staff who helped me on this occasion, you were all very helpful.  \r\nI would also like to say how nice it is to have the opportunity to call up Care Opinion and speak to an actual person to share my story/feedback rather than having to fill in a paper tick box form, and to know that I will also receive a response from staff is even better :-)","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-06-23T11:53:33.9666667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-06-25T10:08:09.69","readBy":[{"name":"Royal Devon University Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust","count":5}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/856915","id":"856915"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/856915/responses","id":"856915"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/856915/healthservices","id":"856915"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/856915/tags","id":"856915"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/careopinion","id":"careopinion","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rbz12-covid-swabbing-unit","id":"RBZ12-covid-swabbing-unit","score":4},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/worried","id":"worried"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/above%20and%20beyond","id":"above and beyond"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care%20opinion","id":"care opinion"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helped","id":"helped"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helpful","id":"helpful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/test","id":"test"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pleased","id":"pleased"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/inconsistent","id":"inconsistent"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/clear%20instructions","id":"clear instructions"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%20test","id":"covid test"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid","id":"covid"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid-19%20test","id":"covid-19 test"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%2019","id":"covid 19"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/857643","id":"857643"}]},{"id":857563,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Very dissapointing","body":"I am highly disappointed and frustrated by the services of Leister Terrace healthcare and I can say it's absolutely no care provided since the last 6 months we registered and they have only made the process more difficult for us, delayed response, very very callous attitude which is unexpected of a medical center.

Part of this process also included checking of my blood pressure. It was diagnosed as slightly high and a scheduled visit to the nurse was arranged for the following week.  \r\nTwo days after I attended the initial visit, I attended a work related medical. Again, my blood pressure was taken and returned values of 169/105. I was referred to my doctor and restricted at work. A few days later I attended a blood pressure test again at my surgery. My blood pressure returned results of 159/101. The results were escalated to the GP from the nurse. I hadn’t heard anymore information until I collected a repeat prescription for my diabetes. Enclosed was Ramapril and the instructions on the box were to take one per day.  \r\nAfter 1 week, I contacted my surgery to ask if I was required to have my blood pressure checked periodically to determine if the tablets were effective. I was told I would be checked annually but they would put the question to a GP. I had no response for 5 days. I contacted the surgery again but they had no information about the phone call 5 days earlier. They said they would pass it to a GP.  \r\nI was contacted later that day and told I would be checked annually and the dosage I was given was correct. Ten minutes later I was called by the surgery again. The details had also been passed to the Practice nurse who insisted I make an appointment to see her. What annoys me more is there was intention of any follow up to find out if the medication was making an improvement in my blood pressure or hypertension and quite frankly the gp’s dismissive response I believe is not acceptable, given this could cause long term damage to my heart or lifespan.  \r\nThe nurse has taken the correct course of action in my opinion. Is this worth complaining about? I feel the service has been unacceptable in this instance for an illness which could be life threatening if not treated correctly.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-06-23T15:38:39.1966667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-06-25T10:26:11.053","readBy":[{"name":"Fife Health & Social Care Partnership","count":2},{"name":"NHS Fife","count":10},{"name":"Scottish Government","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/856963","id":"856963"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/856963/responses","id":"856963"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/856963/healthservices","id":"856963"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/856963/tags","id":"856963"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/fifehscp-gps","id":"fifehscp-gps","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood","id":"blood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20pressure","id":"blood pressure"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20test","id":"blood test"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diabetes","id":"diabetes"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dismissed","id":"dismissed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/end%20of%20life","id":"end of life"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/failure","id":"failure"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/follow%20up","id":"follow up"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gp","id":"GP"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/heart","id":"heart"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hypertension","id":"hypertension"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/included","id":"included"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/practice%20nurse","id":"practice nurse"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/receptionist","id":"receptionist"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/test","id":"test"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/conflicting%20information","id":"conflicting information"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/under%20pressure","id":"under pressure"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/861950","id":"861950"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/862565","id":"862565"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/862596","id":"862596"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/864177","id":"864177"}]},{"id":857577,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Excellent Nurse-led Child Immunisation…","body":"Thanks to both nurses today who cheerfully, quickly and competently vaccinated my three year old having taken the time to explain exactly what was happening to both me and most importantly, to her.

Reception staff phoned me from the surgery on Monday to book in for a follow up for today.

Ive always felt that the care provided there was of the highest quality in often very difficult circumstances and probably doesnt recieve the plaudits it deserves.  \r\nI have used drugs since i was 18. Actually well before then but only in earnest then.I started with cannabis and grew up in the 90s when there were a lot of all sorts of drugs about. I dabbled with ectasy, speed and cocaine and then heroin. When i was about 25 I stopped using heroin without getting a habit and my drug use calmed down. I was really only using cannabis at nighttime and the occasional binge at the weekend. I was drinking pretty heavily and using valium too to dampen my anxiety.  \r\nWhen I was turned 40 I had a very low period. My relationship was struggling and I felt very lonely. I realised that I could buy heroin online via the darkweb and have it delivered the next day. So I did. This turned into a habit and over a couple of years I got myself into a real tangle. I started knocking about with people who scored on the street and got a few phone numbers. Before long I was scoring in stairwells and using every day. I was somehow managing to hold down a job and help look after my three kids.  \r\nI was using then, i now know through the help of Eileen and James at Fitzwilliam ,because i was deeply unhappy and wanted to self medicate to keep those feelings at bay.  \r\nI've been on a script for buprenorphine and diazepam from Fitzwilliam since about 2013 I believe. I have been through ups and downs during this period but feel that I've made a lot of progress and am currently doing well. A lot of this is down to the dedication and wise guidance of Eileen and James.  \r\nEileen is a prescribing nurse with a therapeutic background and James is a therapist. They have really supported me at a level i needed to make the steps i needed to make to stop using and get myself back on track. This was much about addressing the underlying reasons for my use and I cant thank them enough for their dedication and professional skill. I believe that I may well be dead or homeless or in prison without them. I found out that you cant maintain a heroin habit and go anywhere but down. The only question is how fast.  \r\nI just want to put on record my thanks for this and also for the future of any funding that may be in question for this service. I've spent many hours in the Fitzwilliam centre and I've seen the wide range of clients there. From folk that are homeless and living fix to fix to professionals who've picked up an opiate habit somewhere along the line and everyone in between. We're all the same really. But the calmness and caring nature of the staff there is unbelievable. I have had support from plenty of others along the way - Dave, Rod, Sarah, Andy and Sid are some of them. They've all been great.  \r\nBut I want to say a special word of thanks to Eileen and James. I went to my GPs surgery for the first time a few months back and was surprised to see that the level of care and attention there wasn't anywhere near that of Fitzwilliam. Its not a fashionable area of healthcare and is unlikely to be a priority for some commissioners. The lives of many of its clients are very tough and they present a variety of challenges on a daily basis. I don't know how many give feedback but I've never seen anyone treated with anything other than kindness and respect even when behaving occasionally pretty badly.  \r\nI'm now living by himself and with access to my three children regularly - a better father to them and a happier person.  \r\nIn summary my view is that this is an excellent service and vital for supporting people who get themselves in difficulties with opiates. It can happen to anyone. I would recommend that this service is maintained in its current structure if the opinions I've heard from opiate users in other cities who have had their services run by other companies is anything to go by. I'm certain i got a far better service than my friend in other cities for example. On a wider level have a look at other countries to see what can happen if you don't fund and prioritise this work properly. The worst drugs deaths figures in Europe.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-06-23T14:20:17.6866667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-06-25T10:39:27.74","readBy":[{"name":"Sheffield Health and Social Care NHS Foundation Trust","count":5},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2021)","count":2},{"name":"Healthwatch Sheffield","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/856945","id":"856945"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/856945/responses","id":"856945"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/856945/healthservices","id":"856945"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/856945/tags","id":"856945"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/tah-drugs-opiates","id":"TAH-drugs-opiates","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/attention","id":"attention"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/calming","id":"calming"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/caring","id":"caring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cocaine","id":"cocaine"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dedication","id":"dedication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/drinking","id":"drinking"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/drug","id":"drug"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/drugs","id":"drugs"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/excellent","id":"excellent"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/great","id":"great"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/guidance","id":"guidance"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happier","id":"happier"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/help","id":"help"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/heroin","id":"heroin"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/homeless","id":"homeless"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kindness","id":"kindness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/more%20funding","id":"More funding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/overall%20care","id":"Overall care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professionalism","id":"professionalism"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/respect","id":"respect"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/run","id":"run"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scoring","id":"scoring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/skilled%20staff","id":"skilled staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/speed","id":"speed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surprised","id":"surprised"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported","id":"supported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tolerance","id":"tolerance"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thanks","id":"thanks"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/860120","id":"860120"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/860224","id":"860224"}]},{"id":856964,"author":"Debzter","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Recovery from alcohol","body":"Came in to get a rescue kit due to an experience a few days ago finding someone who had overdosed.

Her referral was done on November 2018 and we have only had a consultation call from the community paediatrician on June 2020 but we’ve had no face to face appointment. I’ve been trying to chase this up and yesterday at the speech and language appointment I asked about her referral and it’s came to their attention that my daughter is down on the waiting list for seeing the community paediatrician but she’s not in the list for the NDP. I was told she would be seen by both. This morning I did a bit of investigating to find out why she’s not on the NDP system (it’s been confirmed to me she never was either) all because her previous speech and language therapist didn’t complete the input requested by the community paediatrician.  \r\nMy daughter has been failed by speech and language countless times and this is a very important part for her development. She had over 6 months of not being seen by her previous therapist (prior to covid) after being passed onto their caseload. This therapist was not truthful to both myself and my daughter’s school, from denying conversations have taken place to not providing what they said they would. The list is honestly endless but this new revelation is the tip of the iceberg.  \r\nI’ve done 3 placement requests for my daughter to be put in a school with a unit to help with her speech and language all 3 were rejected and after the 3rd I was told no appeal would be heard. School try their best but they simply cannot cope with her. Every day last week I had a phone call to collect my daughter from school and it happened Monday and Tuesday this week to. This is having a huge impact on her education especially when she was on a part time table right up until December last year.  \r\nI’ve been to my local MP, councillor no one wants to know and I’m a total loss what to do. I feel I’m failing my little girl and it doesn’t matter how much noise I make with these different agencies no one wants to know.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-06-23T20:31:53.96","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-06-25T11:03:47.95","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lanarkshire","count":5},{"name":"St. Andrews University ScotGEM Medical Students","count":1},{"name":"North Lanarkshire Health & Social Care Partnership","count":1},{"name":"Partnership for Change","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/857062","id":"857062"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/857062/responses","id":"857062"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/857062/healthservices","id":"857062"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/857062/tags","id":"857062"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sl9-community-services","id":"SL9-community-services","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sl9-speech-and-language-therapy","id":"SL9-speech-and-language-therapy","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/angry","id":"angry"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stressed","id":"stressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appeal","id":"appeal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/autistic","id":"autistic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diagnosis","id":"diagnosis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/face","id":"face"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/follow%20up","id":"follow up"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/honesty","id":"honesty"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/important","id":"important"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/language","id":"language"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/noise","id":"noise"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/referral","id":"referral"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/speech","id":"speech"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/speech%20and%20language","id":"Speech and Language"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid","id":"covid"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/access%20to%20specialist%20services","id":"access to specialist services"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%2019","id":"covid 19"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/857627","id":"857627"}]},{"id":857609,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Feel at Ease","body":"Staff were so pleasant and understanding.

I never believed that anyone could do anything to help me and actually did I ever want helping?  \r\nJoining the CGL Programme enabled me to access my life, see the wider picture and begin to plan positive steps ahead.  \r\nAt no point was I made to feel pressured to do anything - in fact, the first time I took part, I didn't want to do anything and thought I was ok.  \r\nSlowly but surely things started to change, the mist cleared, the steps of the staircase were easier to climb, goals (however small) could be achieved.  \r\nWinston supported me all the way and was always friendly, honest and professional - never afraid to have that blunt conversation - when needed - only happened once. And boy did I need it!  \r\nI owe so much to the CGL Programme and Winston. He was always there when I needed him. He always understood what I was going through!  \r\nI must also thank Mark who works alongside Winston. He knew my position and situation and spoke from experience with understanding. It was by talking to Mark that I decided to stop drinking. Mark, you are a star! You helped me so much and I can never thank you enough.  \r\nFollowing 'the conversation' with Winston who then referred me to Mark, my life changed dramatically.  \r\nI could now see the horizon and even today I feel I am still sailing and continuing to see, seek and discover new horizons that I could never have imagined before.  \r\nI am now 82 days free of alcohol and 47 days smoke free.  \r\nI am now able to get in my car and drive whenever I want, make appointments for late afternoons, go and do whatever I want, when I want.  \r\nIt has not been easy and I am sure there will be challenges and hurdles along the way but Winston, Mark and the CGL Programme have given me the tools and strategies to put in place and keep me on this positive, bright journey.  \r\nThank you again Winston - and like you said - with the best possible intensions, I hope our paths never cross again, and if they ever do it will be nothing but celebratory.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-06-23T16:22:54.1933333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-06-25T11:54:53.033","readBy":[{"name":"Change Grow Live","count":6},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2021)","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/856966","id":"856966"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/856966/responses","id":"856966"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/856966/healthservices","id":"856966"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/856966/tags","id":"856966"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/nms-cglb","id":"nms-cglb","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/addiction","id":"addiction"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/alcohol","id":"alcohol"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/drinking","id":"drinking"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helped","id":"helped"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/positive","id":"positive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/smoking","id":"smoking"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/strategies","id":"strategies"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tools","id":"tools"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/understanding","id":"understanding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/understood","id":"understood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported","id":"supported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thankful","id":"Thankful"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/858124","id":"858124"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/858136","id":"858136"}]},{"id":857613,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Children’s a&e amazing staff","body":"The staff are amazing with children and helped ease nerves they make sure every child is seen to and best care is given ","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2021-06-25T02:20:03","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-06-25T11:55:29","readBy":[{"name":"East Kent Hospitals University NHS Foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/857613","id":"857613"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/857613/responses","id":"857613"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/857613/healthservices","id":"857613"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/857613/tags","id":"857613"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rvv01","id":"RVV01","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helped","id":"helped"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing","id":"amazing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20ease","id":"at ease"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/866710","id":"866710"}]},{"id":857612,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Superb maternity care ","body":"The care myself , husband and baby have received by the maternity team between 22/6-24/6 has been outstanding.

MAU needs an overhaul as well as the recovery and postnatal unit. I found the facilities dirty and in poor working order (the toilets) in the ward were frequently clogged. My clinical care prior to giving birth was good and birthing midwives hit and miss, one in particular was amazing.\n\nThe nightmare started following birth. Recovery unit whilst waiting for transfer was dirty, midwife had pulled off my canula leaving blood exposed on hands, not hearing my worry about this and walking off. Food given was cold and stale haven’t not eaten for few days.\n\nI was transferred to a hospital bed in the ward where the lights were broken and toilets not working. The alarm didn’t always work and sometimes when it did, staff will not come to help. I had the main light on over my bed, making it difficult to sleep - reported many times not fixed during my long stay and wasn’t offered to change until my last day.\n\nInstead of having open access to showers you have bathrooms in the ward, which is awful if you’ve had surgery needing to climb into the bath and avoid getting incision area wet. \n\nThe worst part of all were the staff. I found most of them uncaring, some extremely rude and left feeling fearful with my newborn. The receptionist was rude as well as one of the kitchen staff. Food isn’t fresh and nutritious. The clinical assistants, including the midwives were shocking. You will regularly hear they were looking after 8 women and run off their feet. Perhaps if they were given fewer patients to look after they may remember why they chose to come into the caring profession and be kind. \n\nSome midwives pushed their personal agenda for breastfeeding and disregarded clinical advise from doctors to offer formula to manage my child’s clinical condition were confusing, especially being shouted, left me in tears many times. \n\nGiving birth in lockdown as a first time mum was challenging navigating the system. Finding ones self in the postnatal ward in the situation l was in was traumatising. My husband was only allowed to see me for an hour due to pandemic, which l understand but this should have been extended to provide us with help seeing help from the staff wasn’t always at hand.\n\nThere were a handful of midwives and clinical assistants who were caring and although pressured on the whole were kind. The paediatric doctors were wonderful and registrars lovely - I never met a consultant during my stay.\n\nYou wouldn’t expect this from a world class centre and it’s a great shame. Unless there is serious improvement in the facilities and attitude of staff, l cannot see myself returning especially now revealing the negative aspect of my experience.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2021-06-25T05:27:06","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2021-06-25T12:03:19","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/857616","id":"857616"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/857616/responses","id":"857616"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/857616/healthservices","id":"857616"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/857616/tags","id":"857616"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rj122","id":"RJ122","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/birth","id":"birth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood","id":"blood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/broken","id":"broken"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disregarded","id":"disregarded"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fearful","id":"fearful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/feet","id":"feet"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/giving%20birth","id":"giving birth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good","id":"good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/great","id":"great"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hand","id":"hand"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hearing","id":"hearing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/incision","id":"incision"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/midwives","id":"midwives"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20good","id":"not good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/paediatric","id":"paediatric"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/postnatal","id":"postnatal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pressured","id":"pressured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing","id":"amazing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wonderful","id":"wonderful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pushed%20out","id":"pushed out"}]},{"id":857237,"author":"trapperhf34","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Got vaccinated today","body":"At John Scott, staff was very friendly, kind and efficient.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-06-24T08:24:19.6","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2021-06-25T12:08:30.16","readBy":[{"name":"City & Hackney GP Confederation","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/857237","id":"857237"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/857237/responses","id":"857237"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/857237/healthservices","id":"857237"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/857237/tags","id":"857237"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/q71-chconfed-covid19vaccine","id":"q71-chconfed-covid19vaccine","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%20vaccine","id":"covid vaccine"}]},{"id":857236,"author":"vickksvapour","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"cancellation policy SHSCT","body":"x 2 cancellation policy is in my opinion somewhat extreme.

I contacted GDNRSS who were totally unhelpful and basically told me that they couldn't give me any information because it was all confidential. I contacted St Peter's andrology who perform the surgery and they were more helpful but told me they were bound by confidentiality because of NHS England. All places told me that there is no mental health support put in place. It is almost impossible to get mental health support via a GP. Everywhere just passes the buck to another place in an endless circle.  \r\nI am now faced with the possibility of an interminable wait (even longer than the years-long wait I already expected) or perhaps even having to somehow self-fund (I do not have the money for this) for the second half of an operation that I would not have embarked on if I knew I could be left stuck with half a penis after going through the first half of an operation that was already an ordeal.  \r\nNHS England is totally failing in its duty of care to too many people.

Every other nurse has been great as well, but I've known Laurie the longest, and its to the point where she's not just my nurse, she's my friend.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-06-24T15:50:02.81","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2021-06-25T13:07:57.493","readBy":[{"name":"Plymouth University, MNurs Nursing 2021","count":1},{"name":"NHS Ayrshire & Arran","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/857340","id":"857340"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/857340/responses","id":"857340"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/857340/healthservices","id":"857340"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/857340/tags","id":"857340"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sa9-community-nursing-service","id":"SA9-Community-Nursing-Service","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/attentive","id":"attentive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/district%20nursing","id":"district nursing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/excellent","id":"excellent"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good","id":"good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/great","id":"great"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/help","id":"help"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helped%20me","id":"helped me"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nursing","id":"nursing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attitude","id":"staff attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supportive","id":"supportive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/impressed","id":"impressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/contactable","id":"contactable"}]},{"id":857457,"author":"coordinationme45","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"New Patient","body":"I’m a new patient so have never been to the practice but so far they have been very helpful in signing me up.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-06-24T21:45:15.35","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-06-25T13:08:47.25","readBy":[{"name":"Barton House Group Practice","count":3},{"name":"City & Hackney GP Confederation","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/857457","id":"857457"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/857457/responses","id":"857457"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/857457/healthservices","id":"857457"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/857457/tags","id":"857457"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/f84008","id":"F84008","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gp","id":"GP"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helpful","id":"helpful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/registration","id":"registration"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/857663","id":"857663"}]},{"id":857431,"author":"DannySM","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Possible TIA","body":"Ended up in FVRH outpatients twice last week, having phoned in to 111 with a possible TIA on two occasions - severe, consistent pain in left arm from wrist to shoulder.

However what wasnt expected was having to repeatedly ask for pain relief! It felt much like begging for pain medication every 4 hrs. At one stage I was asked did I take a lot of medication at home because I needed so much morphine. What exactly was this staff member asking me? In agony and not in good form, this was extremely upsetting? I felt like they were trying to say I had issues. I was left feeling like I couldn't ask for pain relief. Foot surgery is extremely painful which I knew would be the case but to be left feeling like I couldn't ask for help was even more upsetting.  \r\nAlso little things like helping a pt on crutches pack to go home would go along way.  \r\nNot all bad.

parent/guardian","title":"My son's injury","body":"My young son had suffered a nasty cycling injury and was seen in RBHSC emergency department on a busy weekend.  \r\nHe was frightened and in pain. We were worried about a time critical injury which might need surgery. He was rapidly assessed by a professional and compassionate triage nurse, the resident emergency medicine consultant, a surgeon, and a radiologist who performed an ultrasound. He was also seen by a radiographer who gave him a great sticker and updated us on when the ultrasound would happen to relieve our concerns. Several other nurses and healthcare assistants performed observations and gave him pain relief. The consultant in EM, surgeon and radiologist were particularly memorable for their clarity of explanation to both myself and my son.  \r\nAll the staff dealt with him compassionately, professionally and showed good humour even in the face of a busy department. In many ways their encounter with us will have been unremarkable to them. Not so for us. This where the magic of healthcare really happens. In those small moments of seemingly unremarkable care delivery, there is excellence that we just don't take time to notice and amplify.  \r\nI hope it is useful to reflect these everyday encounters back to healthcare staff to help them appreciate the extraordinary work they do in these extraordinary times. We are very appreciative. Thank you.  \r\n[Unsure about 'Nurses']  \r\n[Unsure about 'Other staff']  \r\n[Unsure about 'Team work']","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-06-24T21:45:54.9666667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-06-25T13:32:54.947","readBy":[{"name":"Belfast Health and Social Care Trust","count":13}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/857458","id":"857458"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/857458/responses","id":"857458"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/857458/healthservices","id":"857458"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/857458/tags","id":"857458"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt001-ed","id":"zt001-ed","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frightened","id":"frightened"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/worried","id":"worried"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/consultant","id":"consultant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cycling","id":"cycling"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/delivery","id":"delivery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency","id":"emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good","id":"good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/healthcare%20assistants","id":"healthcare assistants"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/humour","id":"humour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/injury","id":"injury"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain%20relief","id":"pain relief"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professional","id":"professional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/radiographer","id":"radiographer"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/radiologist","id":"radiologist"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgeon","id":"surgeon"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/teamwork","id":"teamwork"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/triage","id":"triage"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/triage%20nurse","id":"triage nurse"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ultrasound","id":"ultrasound"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appreciative","id":"appreciative"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassionate","id":"compassionate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/multidisciplinary%20team","id":"multidisciplinary team"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/updates","id":"updates"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/clear%20explanations","id":"clear explanations"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sticker","id":"sticker"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/858902","id":"858902"}]},{"id":857456,"author":"Jothetennisgirl","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Radiotherapy Lucky Number 7","body":"I attended for my radiotherapy treatment a few weeks ago, I was nervous and anxious about what it was going to be like.  \r\nI had been through surgery and chemotherapy but this was another daunting step on my journey to recovery.
