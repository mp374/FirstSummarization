It has been very busy for all staff including doctors, but in my opinion, the front house staff do not get enough thanks and praise. so THANK YOU very much the service would not work without you all.  \r\nSecondly, the nurses and phelmos are wonderful, so kind and caring, all bring their own personality and humour, making life seem less serious. Thank you, ladies.  \r\nThirdly, thank you to the GPs who have worked and trained so hard to look after the community in which they work. Pre covid the doctors have been exceptional - offering me time to talk about my problems, even when they are busy and the next patient is waiting. So Thank you - (please can you reintroduce face to face appointments)?  \r\nThank you Elmswood Surgery.

My experience has been a  distressing one from start to finish. It has left me feeling abused, worthless and  traumatised. \n\nI self referred myself for having had occasional depression  in my life. After waiting 6 months with no response when I contacted them they told me they were too busy with other patients and to wait longer. Eventually after nearly 12 months  I saw a nurse and several months later still this led to weekly out patient therapy. However, i never saw a psychiatrist or anyone senior, I  was not assessed, and there was no monitoring or review of my progress.  I never had a care plan either. I struggled to deal with some issues that were brought up in my therapy  that were dealt with insensitively and judgmentally. When i tried to say something i was shouted down and accused me of being out of touch and in denial. Sessions kept being cancelled at the last minute and kept changing place which left me anxious and confused. Eventually it got to the point where it was doing me far more harm than good and I asked to see someone else. However they  discharged me when they knew I was feeling suicidal. When both myself and my partner tried to find alternative help for me and I was in crisis at this point they simply referred me back to the trust who had discharged me but they didn‚Äôt respond . They asked why doesn‚Äôt my partner look after me?  My partner raised a concern on my behalf about their bad service, lack of safeguarding, no risk assessment, no  crisis help and their lack of  compassion. Basically his complaint was about their whole flawed system and attitude. The response of the Trust was dismissive - they didn‚Äôt respond to him, refused to meet him and then said it was all my fault.  \n\nAny patient who raises a complaint with this Trust is dismissed as mentally unwell, and we are stereotyped with all kinds of humiliating  labels in order for the trust to place the blame on us for their appalling services. Al  in all, it  has all been a very horrible time for both me and my partner and I wish I had never self referred to them in the first place.

The nurse asked what I'd come for and I proceeded to tell her of my symptoms.  \r\nI stated I had horrible health anxiety and that I'd seen 3 doctors and been to the doctors 5 times in the last few weeks, I had 3 different opinions that didn't help at all and kept being sent away and feeling like I was being failed, but that's another story.  \r\nI told the nurse at that moment I felt like I was going to have a stroke as my face was tingling intermittently on a daily basis but was getting worse with weak limbs and she showed zero compassion, zero enthusiasm to help, and cut me off while I was explaining from the beginning all my symptoms hoping to get some facts or helpful answers pertaining to my problems, and said you need to go see your doctor or call 111.  \r\nI'd already said about my doctor as stated above, and 111 told me to see my doctor, so I was going in circles with no closure and suffered badly, mentally, over the last month. So that caused me more and more stress each time I was sent away with no information to provide closure or hope.  \r\nI tried not to go to A&E but when you think you're going to collapse where else do you turn to? Well apparently not A&E, at least not in this nurse's opinion. I felt she looked at me like I was wasting her time. She told me nothing to help me calm down, she told me no potential reasons for my symptoms and within a few minutes of talking I was told she can't do anything for my anxiety or symptoms and I was to see my doc and go home.  \r\nNow for all I knew I could have had a stroke walking home, paranoid again being sent away with no information or help, and felt like it would take a funeral to be taken seriously.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-06-03T14:21:52.3133333","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2021-06-07T09:20:02.48","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Ayrshire & Arran","count":6},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/851521","id":"851521"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/851521/responses","id":"851521"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/851521/healthservices","id":"851521"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/851521/tags","id":"851521"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/a111h_180","id":"A111H_180","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stress","id":"stress"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/enthusiasm","id":"Enthusiasm"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/failed","id":"failed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kindness","id":"kindness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20taken%20seriously","id":"not taken seriously"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tingling","id":"tingling"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassion","id":"compassion"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/no%20hope","id":"no hope"}]},{"id":851551,"author":"Teragram","authorRoleId":7,"authorRole":"a staff member posting for a carer/relative","title":"Waiting times","body":"My husband was referred to Orthopaedics in 2020 due ongoing issues with his hip. GP referral highly expected the requirement for hip replacement. He waited well over the expected time to have an initia appointmemt with the consultant. Eventually he saw the consultant in Feb to be advised his hip was extremely bad and he was placed on the urgent list for surgery. He was advised at that he would have his surgery within 12 weeks. Some weeks later he received a letter to say that it would be between 48-52 weeks before he would get the operation. This was extremely disappointing and devastating news to say the least, as he has become extremely disabled as a result of the constant and worsening pain, difficulty in mobilising and the increasing need to use aids for walking and daily living activities. His mental health has also taken a battering due to not being able to work, mobilise or undertake any duties within the home and having to rely on me constantly. I wrote to our MSP to to explore the issues of the now very lengthy waiting time and we were subsequently advised that the letter was erroneously sent out to him. He has now received a further appointment in May with another consultant to be informed that his original consultant has now retired and his care has been handed over. He was then sent for further xray (unclear why, as his condition has only worsened from the initial 'extremely bad' status). It would appear that his referral process is now starting from scratch. So to add insult to injury he finds himself in a long waiting list!!!! I cannot express enough how devastating this is as his condition has not only had a huge impact on him but on myself having to manage his mental health issues, frustrations and support him as best I can for an indefinite period of time. My other concern is that the longer he has to wait on his surgery the more compromised his other hip becomes due to his profound limp and shortening of his affected leg, this was identified at the initial consultation. The consultant advised that he would try to rectify this by undertaking some lengthening as part of the hip replacement surgery. I would also like to acknowledge that as a healthcare worker myself, I'm acutely aware of the impact COVID pandemic has had on NHS services and beyond however, I am deeply disappointed that  \r\nmore is not being done to address the waiting times for patients whose quality of life has been significantly affected by the protracted waiting times.. I also would like to say that I appreciate that my husband's situation is not a life or death scenario but nonetheless he is suffering deeply.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-06-03T18:33:53.22","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-06-07T09:20:02.59","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Forth Valley","count":5}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/851551","id":"851551"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/851551/responses","id":"851551"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/851551/healthservices","id":"851551"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/851551/tags","id":"851551"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/forth-valley-royal-orthopaedic","id":"forth-valley-royal-orthopaedic","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/concern","id":"concern"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disabled","id":"disabled"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hip%20replacement","id":"hip replacement"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/orthopaedics","id":"orthopaedics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting%20times","id":"waiting times"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/walking","id":"walking"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20disappointed","id":"very disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pandemic","id":"pandemic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%20delays","id":"covid delays"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/852096","id":"852096"}]},{"id":851553,"author":"couragedm53","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Emergency out of hours social workers","body":"Emergency out of hours social workers night time.  \r\nCalled them and they answered really quick got someone to call me back.

She was erupting blood from all orifices. I called 999 and asked for an ambulance. It took a worrying two hours to get to us, and then two came at once - which, as it turned out, was a good thing.  \r\nThe ambulance staff were very thorough and professional. They immediately took care of her - we were exhausted after two hours desperately trying to comfort her and control her whilst she was in pain and still erupting from both ends.  \r\nThey called ahead to University Hospital Monklands to get them prepared for her admission and a doctor was standing by so she would get immediate care.  \r\nIt was around 10pm before they were ready to make the journey to the hospital.  \r\nMy mother was taken to A&E then onto Critical Care/ICU.  \r\nI was called by a doctor and told that she needed a blood transfusion and asked me a number of questions.  \r\nMy daughter then reminded me that her gran had a laminated card in her purse to be given to doctors if she ever had to be given blood.  \r\nI took this 50 year old card which was barely readable down to the A&E. The receptionist immediately saw the importance of it, asked me to wait, and went to hand it to the doctors who were treating her. She came back and passed on the doctors thanks.  \r\nI then had a few phone calls in the early hours of the morning with doctors broaching the delicate subject of resuscitation should it be necessary.  \r\nShe was taken to theatre where she had a scope to try to find out the cause with the view of deciding upon treatment.  \r\nLater I was called again with an explanation of what had been found and that she had settled a little but was being kept in Critical Care/ICU.  \r\nLuckily my mother responded well to the treatment and her condition improved. She spent a few days in Critical Care before being transferred to Ward 10 and eventually onto Ward 7 before being discharged into the care of my partner and I.  \r\nI‚Äôd like to pass on our gratitude to all the doctors, surgeons, nurses, auxiliaries, ambulance teams, and the A&E receptionist who took such wonderful care of her.  \r\nShe spent her 90th birthday in hospital - the ward staff arranged a birthday cake for her and some gifts. They, with some assistance from some fellow patients, made every effort to make my mothers 90th birthday a celebration.  \r\nI‚Äôd also like to say that I fully appreciate being allowed in to visit her each day.  \r\nMy only criticism is that when she was discharged she was only given enough prescription for a week. With the Bank Holiday We had to endure 1 day without medication.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-06-03T21:04:42.0033333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-06-07T09:20:02.793","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lanarkshire","count":17},{"name":"Scottish Ambulance Service","count":13},{"name":"Scottish Government","count":1},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":1},{"name":"Partnership for Change","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/851559","id":"851559"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/851559/responses","id":"851559"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/851559/healthservices","id":"851559"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/851559/tags","id":"851559"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l106h_100","id":"L106H_100","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l106h_180","id":"L106H_180","score":5},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l106h_301","id":"L106H_301","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/scot-ambulance-emergency","id":"scot-ambulance-emergency","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/elderly","id":"elderly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/exhausted","id":"exhausted"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good","id":"good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hand","id":"hand"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/in%20control","id":"in control"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20good","id":"not good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/paramedics","id":"paramedics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/patient%20notes","id":"patient notes"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professionalism","id":"professionalism"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thorough","id":"thorough"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/visiting","id":"visiting"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/yes","id":"YES"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gratitude","id":"gratitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wonderful","id":"wonderful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/access%20to%20medication","id":"access to medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/involved%20in%20decisions","id":"involved in decisions"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thanks","id":"thanks"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/852062","id":"852062"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/854673","id":"854673"}]},{"id":851560,"author":"Rw39","authorRoleId":3,"authorRole":"a parent/guardian","title":"Self Directed Support -

He is absolutely terrified of needles and the dentist but the team of dentists and dental nurses who dealt with him at the health centre and later on in the ward when he was having problems were wonderful too.  \r\nI want to mention Danielle who travelled with him to the dentist and kept me informed and kept his spirits up. Throughout his stay she was fantastic and a pleasure to see when I visited. I also want to mention Skye who was one of his nurses.

I was so relieved this wasnt my experience.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-06-04T13:01:07.1266667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-06-07T11:18:02.92","readBy":[{"name":"Royal Devon University Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust","count":4}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/851679","id":"851679"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/851679/responses","id":"851679"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/851679/healthservices","id":"851679"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/851679/tags","id":"851679"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rbz12-covid-swabbing-unit","id":"RBZ12-covid-swabbing-unit","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nervous","id":"nervous"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/explanation","id":"explanation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gentle","id":"gentle"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurse","id":"nurse"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid-19","id":"covid-19"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%20test","id":"covid test"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/851891","id":"851891"}]},{"id":851688,"author":"Mrsneverin","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"My diabetes","body":"Thanks to the diabetic nurses I have now got my diabetes under control.

My mum is in her 80's and modern technology is not her friend and she is unable to use it even though my nephew has tried many times to show her how to use it. I live in London and I have recently just finished chemotherapy for lung cancer so this service lets us see each other and more importantly my mum is able to see that I am doing ok. A video chat with my family always cheers my mum up which is the best tonic for her. I find this service invaluable and it would be very disappointing if it was removed. A lot of elderly patients have family all around the world and this service gives them the opportunity to chat with the patient.

I think it helps a lot of people, but not all. You can not win them all, its down to the individuals willpower to beat their addiction. I went to Farlington for a Detox for ten days and I met a lot of good people and some of the stories I heard were heartbreaking. In my opinion a lot of people there were helped and hopefully will go on to sort themselves out to get on with their lives. The counsellors and staff were great. At New Milton I found uncomfortable talking in front of a group of strangers about personal problems, some people find it intimidating and are put off from attending. Possible one to one with a Key Worker would suit some people better. Although I know you have limited resources. But overall I think Inclusion helps a lot of people.

I feel I was indeed truly fortunate to have met such a compassionate, understanding and experienced professional.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-06-04T19:00:05.6633333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-06-07T15:07:17.79","readBy":[{"name":"Belfast Health and Social Care Trust","count":6}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/851739","id":"851739"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/851739/responses","id":"851739"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/851739/healthservices","id":"851739"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/851739/tags","id":"851739"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt001-continence-team","id":"zt001-continence-team","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/caring","id":"caring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/courteous","id":"courteous"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fortunate","id":"fortunate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/great","id":"great"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helped","id":"helped"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helpful","id":"helpful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kind","id":"kind"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professional","id":"professional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/skin","id":"skin"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassionate","id":"compassionate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassuring","id":"reassuring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20home","id":"at home"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/854592","id":"854592"}]},{"id":851810,"author":"willow1234","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Scared of needles","body":"I‚Äôm so scared of needles and the doctor and medical student looking after me we‚Äôre so considerate and ensured I was okay.

I was in ITU for 5 weeks and another 5 weeks between HDU and the wards. I don't remember much about my stay in ITU other than being very frightened. When I was transferred out into the wards I couldn't do very much for myself, I was catheterised, had a feeding tube and was oxygen dependent. Throughout my stay the staff were exceptional from A&E to critical care and beyond, they saved my life and cared for my family as much as they could. Despite their own challenges from wearing full PPE all day, being short staffed and I'm sure very stressed they all treated me with respect and never allowed these issues to impact on my care. Ward 15 staff from the lovely singing housekeeper to the consultant Dr Harrow could not do enough for me. There were 3 brilliant student nurses who kept me sane and I'm sure will become exceptional staff nurses. Gary and Peter who come by for a chat when they could. Lesley on night shift and Sharon who talked me off a ledge a few times when the enormity of my situation hit home. I can not thank them all enough for their care, professionalism, compassion and just the chat that got me through the day. I am also a nurse and I feel so proud to wear the same uniform as them. A big thank you also to the rehab team especially Marie and Rebecca. The ongoing support has been fantastic from the inspire group to making sure any ongoing issues have been investigated and followed up. I am on my way to recovery it has been slow and frustrating but I couldn't have done it without this amazing team.

She was then admitted to Singleton for cardiology diagnostics and diagnosed with an irregular heart rhythm and started on betablockers. Now she is waiting review under Morriston cardiology and being monitored by the gp.  \r\nMore recently she became unwell with what we thought was oral thrush and vaginal thrush. Having seen the pharmacy and gp for this we were shocked when she developed an awful rash quite widespread along with ulcers.  \r\nThe 111 call handler was amazing, she listened to us, allowed me to speak for my daughter as she has severe anxiety and felt quite embarrassed. She found her record by listening to the fact she doesn't use her real name. She put the call straight through to the gp oohs. We received a GP call back within 10 minutes. The GP asked numbers questions and put all the recent symptoms together and diagnosed a very rare syndrome. To make sure he booked her an appointment that night within 2 hours. She was then examined and given steroids and strong anthisamines and told that if it worsens she may need admission.  \r\nWhat an absolute amazing service from start to finish. The call handler was lovely, genuine and kind. Within 3 hours she was trialed, seen, diagnosed and treated.

With CGLs help I have now completely stopped drinking etc and I'm a happy, motivated person.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-06-07T06:39:55.0933333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-06-08T08:08:03.48","readBy":[{"name":"Change Grow Live","count":5},{"name":"Sheffield Hallam University, Nursing BSc (21-9)","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/851838","id":"851838"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/851838/responses","id":"851838"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/851838/healthservices","id":"851838"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/851838/tags","id":"851838"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/nms-cambridgeshire","id":"nms-cambridgeshire","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/addiction","id":"addiction"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/alcohol","id":"alcohol"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/drinking","id":"drinking"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/groups","id":"groups"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helped","id":"helped"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/strategies","id":"strategies"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support%20worker","id":"support worker"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/the%20change","id":"the change"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happy","id":"happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported","id":"supported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/motivated","id":"motivated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/remote%20groups","id":"remote groups"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/852086","id":"852086"}]},{"id":851906,"author":"leobm39","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Change of key worker","body":"I had a key worker that I worked well with and unfortunately the powers that be decided that my worker wasn't going to see me anymore because I fell into the wrong category 4 or 5 months went passed and I never had contact with my new key worker.
