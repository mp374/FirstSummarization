[{"id":839549,"author":"Petrichor13","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Rude and Unhelpful","body":"Over the last 2 weeks I have been trying to quit my dependence on nicotine lozenges and as I had been advised to quit cold turkey due to a serious physical health issue, I thought I would try to get a little moral support from this service. The first lady I spoke to on 2 occasions was very helpful and kind. Over the last 2 days and nearing the end of the 2nd week of my quit I was seriously struggling so I spoke to my very helpful GP who advised that I should try a nicotine patch and taper down over the next few weeks, and that the symptoms I am struggling with are 100% related to severe nicotine withdrawal from having gone cold turkey off a relatively high (26mg) of nicotine per day. So today, I phoned the helpline again for a chat and some support and spoke to another advisor who was appallingly rude to the point of reducing me to tears when I came off the phone. Stated that they thought it was 'very unusual, very strange' that my GP thought my symptoms were due to nicotine withdrawal, implying that they either didn't believe that I had spoken to my GP or that my GP didn't know how to diagnose nicotine withdrawal. I told the advisor that my GP had advised the patch which I am buying myself, and again was rudely told that I was too hung up on things and that I wasn't suffering from nicotine withdrawal as it should be all out of your system after 3 days - that it was all anxiety and that I should concentrate on that. What this advisor didn't know was that my GP had already discussed with me anxiety as one of my quit symptoms and had told me that anxiety is one of the most prominent symptoms of withdrawal for the first 2 to 4 weeks and possibly up to the first 3 months to a lesser extent, so I had indeed been screened by a qualified medical professional who deemed that I was not suffering from 'just anxiety' in isolation which I had brought on myself as I clearly was experiencing other nicotine withdrawal symptoms in addition. I felt belittled and not listened to. I feel that it is extremely worrying that an advisor on this helpline would force an opinion over that of my medically qualified GP, and have been very upset by my experience.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-04-15T19:10:19.8133333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-04-20T09:22:40.933","readBy":[{"name":"NHS 24","count":39},{"name":"NHS Lanarkshire","count":9},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":1},{"name":"North Lanarkshire Health & Social Care Partnership","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/839549","id":"839549"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/839549/responses","id":"839549"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/839549/healthservices","id":"839549"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/839549/tags","id":"839549"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/nhs24-quit-your-way-scotland","id":"NHS24-quit-your-way-scotland","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sl9-stop-smoking-service","id":"SL9-stop-smoking-service","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20being%20listened%20to","id":"not being listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20listened%20to","id":"not listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/belittled","id":"belittled"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dismissed","id":"dismissed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dismissive","id":"dismissive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nicotine%20addiction","id":"nicotine addiction"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nicotine%20replacement%20therapy","id":"nicotine replacement therapy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/rudeness","id":"rudeness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stop%20smoking%20service","id":"Stop Smoking Service"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upsetting","id":"upsetting"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/spoken%20over","id":"spoken over"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/840497","id":"840497"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/841443","id":"841443"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/842250","id":"842250"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/843092","id":"843092"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/843913","id":"843913"}]},{"id":839698,"author":"Patient 73","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Attendance at Day Procedures Ward","body":"I attended the Day Procedures Unit in March and April 2021.  \r\nAs a former senior staff member in the Health Service I would have a detailed knowledge of sevices and the standards of care required for an effective service.  \r\nMy treatment consisted of IV Infusions for Ulcerative Colitis.  \r\nMy overall impression of the facility and standards of nursing care were excellent.  \r\nThe environment was bright and spacious which was conducive in itself.

I felt they understood what I wanted to avoid happening again. I felt they were very much on my team. I was on my own due to restrictions with childcare but I think it went better with just the midwifery care rather than having my husband present!  \r\nThe disappointing elements of the experience had nothing to do with the care or expertise of the staff. Instead, there were a number of times that technology let the staff down. There were issues with the drips not working and then something I needed to be able to move about wasn't working so I couldn't leave the side of the bed. It's a shame that the staff don't have the reliable equipment that they need. The hospital was also extremely busy. Staff were clearly working very hard but they were constantly searching for equipment that wasn't in the right places and services were delayed. Fortunately I didn't need much support afterwards but it would have been scary if I was a first time mum.

He was advised to admit himself to the hospital immediately as there was no longer an option to treat him at home. His blood pressure went immediately over 200 at the news and he was pretty much resigned to his fate, which he believed was a one-way journey.  \r\nAfter a number of frantic phone calls we found out that an acute care team at home was a potential option. We thought it was a pretty unlikely option given my parents live out in the country, but amazingly the Dungannon team arrived in little over an hour, with a doctor and nurse arriving to immediately get to work and the consultant following later in the day. They gave diuretic IV, took bloods, and provided my father with the reassurance he needed and a high duty of care. That continued every day over the next two weeks whilst the fluid slowly drained out of my father’s chest, lungs and legs.  \r\nHe is now back at his fighting weight, his breathing has returned to normal and he is back close to his old self. But more importantly, he now knows that when things are not as they should be there is an alternative option to hospital admission. I have no way of knowing what the outcome of my father being admitted to hospital would have been.  \r\nThankfully, the Dungannon acute care at team home meant that I didn’t have to think about that scenario for too long. But I do have tears in my eyes as I write it. Thank you to everyone who provided such a high level of care to my father over the past few weeks, you are all legends and a credit to your profession.

I said what the doctor had told me and they said that it was no longer needed and that I was fine, I said I was still in a lot of pain so the nurse got another new doctor to come to see me who had quite an aggressive manner and said that they don’t think it’s anything bad and that they need the bed!Before I could say anything they were packing my stuff and asking me to call a cab to go home.

We were not given any real information about the operation, preparation, etc until the day before surgery and this was very stressful. We didn't know he would need to fast, for example, so we hadn't been able to talk to him about this in advance. The doctor had said we would have 3 phone calls leading up to the surgery to discuss everything but that didn't happen. We had one phone call to give us the surgery date, which was bizarre and rude! A staff member called my mobile and abruptly asked if a certain date would do for my son without saying what it was in reference to - I had to ask who it was! I thought it was perhaps someone from school! When I asked where they were calling from they said Ninewells and it all began to make sense. I had a couple of questions, such as would I be able to come in with him, but they didn't seem to know anything and couldn't direct me to anyone else. They then said we would receive a call to book a covid test and would then have to isolate for 4 days. The date arrived and we still hadn't received any such call, so I spent half a day (whilst meant to be working) navigating the labyrinthine Ninewells switchboard system, it literally took a few hours and several calls to find out that someone was planning to call us the following day. This was really stressful as I was worried we would arrive for surgery and be turned back for not having had a test, so I had no choice but to spend hours trying to get the information.  \r\nIn the end we received a call booking his test for the following day in the next city, in the middle of my working day. If we could have been given more than a few hours notice this would not have been problematic, but despite having had months to plan for this we were given a few hours notice and it was a nightmare for me logistically. I can't exactly ask a friend or neighbour to cover for me. This is where I feel the NHS treats people as if they have no purpose except to be a patient. I was just expected to reorganise my life, and cause significant disruption to others in the process.  \r\nI was dreading the actual surgery as everything seemed so utterly disorganised and people had been so unhelpful on the phone, but actually it was the opposite. Everyone was amazingly pleasant and efficient. What was fantastic was when staff spoke directly to my son. He is 7 and they treated him with dignity, not speaking over his head but actually addressing him directly. This immediately put him at ease and helped a lot. They used their first names in some cases which was good for helping him to relate and to feel that he knew who was who. We were asked the same half dozen questions in sequence by every professional who came along to introduce themselves, and I guess for children perhaps this is reassuring. It did seem a big demand on staff time and a lot of repetition! Three different medical professionals came along, one after the other, to explain that some cream was going to be put on the back of my son's hand, for example, before the cream was applied.  \r\nThe staff all seemed to like one another and there was such a positive atmosphere, with people smiling and joking with each other. What a difference that made - it felt like a team and not an institution.  \r\nThank you so much to everyone who was there on the day. You were lovely and you were kind and the surgery was not a traumatic experience for my son.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-04-17T15:03:40.49","progress":"Story has a

It is odd because it is different. Not good enough bedside manners. Please don't think I couldn't communicate with them, I have a degree in English and been here for 11 years. This staff member just didn't have good enough manners, just like I wasn't there, and that is simply rude. I felt that they seemed too inexperienced and were taking too long, so much so that their colleague said to hurry up as there was people waiting in the queue.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-04-20T05:11:01.4433333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-04-20T13:37:16.597","readBy":[{"name":"South Eastern Health and Social Care Trust","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/840379","id":"840379"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/840379/responses","id":"840379"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/840379/healthservices","id":"840379"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/840379/tags","id":"840379"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt004-sse-vc","id":"zt004-sse-vc","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/embarrassed","id":"embarrassed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/most%20staff","id":"Most staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20good","id":"not good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/process","id":"process"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/quick","id":"quick"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/some%20staff","id":"some staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20manners","id":"staff manners"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/well%20organised","id":"well organised"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid","id":"covid"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%2019","id":"covid 19"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/840452","id":"840452"}]},{"id":839965,"author":"medichi","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Excellent care","body":"I was under the care of Mr Wright at QEUH over the last couple of years and underwent a number of assessments, investigations and surgical procedures.

In addition, I named a doctor that I DIDN'T want to have any contact with.\nI duly received a message stating that I would be contacted by phone on a date that I was working!!\nI then had to phone the surgery which took 18 minutes as there were 2 calls ahead of me.\nI explained my problem to the receptionist, and she read my online form and said \"this hasn't been read properly AND the doctor contacting me would have been the person I named as not suitable\" and she duly apologised.\nThe receptionist made a appointment for my stated day off, but she couldn't give me a time as the doctor would call me. She also said that if the doctor needed to see me face to face, they would make a further appointment. \nI explained that my foot problem was extremely painful and she said that the doctor might be able to see me on the same day as my phone call. \nThat means that I can't arrange anything for my day off because I have no idea about the time of the phone call, or if I need a physical examination on the same day as the surgery doesn't see patients face to face, without a phone call first.\nIt seems the practice expects you to put a whole day on hold for what may amount to a 10 minute phone call at some time during the day!!!!!!!!!\nIt would appear that the practice's admin is incompetent, and is making the simplest task of making a appointment as awkward as possible.

I called them twice a week ago because I had  strong abdominal pain which interfeared with my daily activities. The MAUI staff were very quick to dismiss my worries and pain. They  suggested taking a worm bath and paracetamol tod deal with this. I was incredibly surprised that they didn't take pelvic pain seriously, especially in a 42-year-old woman with a history a miscarriages as I am. Are a warm bath and paracetamol a cure? How did they know that everything was fine? I called them to understand the origin of the pain and to be reassured, of course, on the basis of some scientific approach. The day after I called 111 and I had more support and help from the emergency doctor, who asked me to go to the hospital. He thought I could have a urine infection and I started antibiotics  while waiting for the results to come in. On Monday I called the MAU again telling about the pain and asking for some help. They thought that my phisical presence there wasn't necessary, that probably I had a urine infection and that I could take again paracetamol to relieve  the pain.  Few days later I learnt that I had no infection. \n\nThey again, totally neglected my worries and the fact I was in distress. \n\nCurrently, I still have abdominal pain and this morning  I also had some brownish discharges. I called again the MAU and they once more told me that it was OK and it wasn't necessary to be checked. I am going to change maternity Unit, of course, and I hope that everything is going to be fine. \n\nI wasn't just surprised by the superficial medical approach and how lightly they took the responsibility to say to a 42 year old woman witj a history of miscarriages to stay home and take some pain killers. I was also surprised that they totally disregarded my feelings and distress. I thought that they should take into account this too, especially in a moment when you're extremely vulnerable. But, let's be honest, nobody really cares about your mental health, a part from when they have to fill a form during the first midwife appointment. \n\n","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2021-04-20T11:06:14","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-04-20T17:31:16","readBy":[{"name":"The Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/840509","id":"840509"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/840509/responses","id":"840509"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/840509/healthservices","id":"840509"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/840509/tags","id":"840509"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rtd02","id":"RTD02","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/neglected","id":"neglected"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/abdominal","id":"abdominal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/antenatal","id":"antenatal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/antibiotics","id":"antibiotics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disregarded","id":"disregarded"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency","id":"emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/infection","id":"infection"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/maternity","id":"maternity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pelvic","id":"pelvic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pelvic%20pain","id":"pelvic pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surprised","id":"surprised"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vulnerable","id":"vulnerable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hope","id":"Hope"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fine","id":"fine"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/no%20hope","id":"no hope"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/841014","id":"841014"}]},{"id":840522,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Second Covid Vaccination, excellent service","body":"Just had my second Covid vaccination and as with first one the service was first class from arrival to leaving.
