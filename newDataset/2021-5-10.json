[{"id":843165,"author":"Worried123","authorRoleId":4,"authorRole":"a relative","title":"We are back at square one","body":"In late April, myself and my former partner's family presented them at QEUH A&E due to extreme paranoia, hallucinations, they are in a psychotic state, danger to themselves and others. Medics sedated him, they remained in resus most of the night, were briefly transferred to ARU3 where I voiced concerns he would abscond. Then transferred to 5C and infact absconded. I found them in A&E extremely disturbed, I am thankful to the Dr who completed an EDC they were detained under mental health act. The following day they were assessed by psychiatry who deemed them no longer in an acute psychosis and discharged them. I really don't know how they could assess this clinical outcome. My former partner was calling me hallucinating and in delusional state and I am not of the same clinical opinion of psychiatrist. He was discharged and over the weekend remains displaying severe psychosis symptoms. Last night he agreed to return to hospital for his safety and public safety. We arrived at QEUH carpark and he absconded. I sought assistance from a family member and we located him. We had no option to contact the police for his welfare, as he is a danger to himself and others due to mental health , i can't fault the police, they accompanied him to a&e where upon assessment triage had to be physically restrained , he was taken to leverndale for assessment. I'm guessing they again attributed his behaviour to drug abuse, but this is not the case whatsoever. He is extremely mentally ill and no one is listening within healthcare services. Within an hour he was discharged from leverndale. To put it bluntly he needs urgent help and I'm at the stage now what does he need to do to get help for his own safety and others safety? Absolutely ashamed of GGC mental health services, a service which I defended when I often heard feedback like this. I have seen it for myself now. Absolutely no words can fathom this experience. We are back at square one with an extremely acutely ill psychotic patient who cannot be safely managed in the community.","criticality":"strongly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-05-04T09:00:05.6133333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-05-10T08:00:21.917","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Education for Scotland","count":1},{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":15},{"name":"Yorkshire & Humber Patient Safety Research Collaboration","count":1},{"name":"Office of Johann Lamont, MSP for Glasgow Pollok","count":1},{"name":"Scottish Recovery Network","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/843165","id":"843165"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/843165/responses","id":"843165"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/843165/healthservices","id":"843165"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/843165/tags","id":"843165"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/g302h_710","id":"G302H_710","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sj9-south-glasgow-hospital-aru","id":"SJ9-south-glasgow-hospital-aru","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/south-glasgow-hospital-accident","id":"south-glasgow-hospital-accident","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disappointed","id":"disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20listening","id":"not listening"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/abuse","id":"abuse"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/access%20to%20services","id":"access to services"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diagnosis","id":"diagnosis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/discharged","id":"discharged"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/paranoia","id":"paranoia"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/psychotic","id":"psychotic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/a&e%20doctor","id":"a&e doctor"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/844955","id":"844955"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/858379","id":"858379"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/858871","id":"858871"}]},{"id":844773,"author":"Movilla","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Covid vaccine","body":"Had an appointment at SSE for first dose.

I phoned blakenall family practice and after 47 calls!!!! We finally got through.  \r\nThe secretary told us we shouldn't have had that letter and book dad for jab at oak park centre. A week after vaccine my dad, 2 sisters, mom, myself, my wife and son all caught covid. Dads chest wasnt very good and docs refused to come and see him and just sent antibiotics.  \r\nCouple of weeks later dad was taken to hospital and passed away.  \r\nWhen phoning about seeing about my disabled sister having jab we was told that she'd been missed and that the secretary would book her on for vaccine at oak park. When I took my sister we was told that her name wasnt down but would give her it anyway as theres always spare.  \r\nCovid has made my asthma worse and after finally speaking to a doctor because 2 of my online consultations wasn't answered they prescribed me a stronger combination steroid inhaler which can make me more prone to catching infections and is organizing chest xrays.  \r\nThey told me to ask reception about trying to get a vaccine as soon as possible. So I asked when I went to get my prescription and the receptionist was very snappy and said no you must wait your turn. I even explained that my job involves coming into contact with public facing staff at approximately 20 different high risk locations a day but this staff member just didn't want to know.  \r\nNow I have recently found out 3 of my relations all younger than me, 2 have very mild asthma symptoms using only blue inhalers, other relation has no health problems, none of them have had covid but all 3 have had first vaccines and all are registered at same practice. How is this organised and how long has it been that a receptionist has a right to pick and choose who gets vaccine. Absolutely disgusting and I'm now worried that I'm going to be missed just like my sister and dont think I could get through another bout of covid.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-03-30T23:46:04.1766667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-05-10T09:20:00.99","readBy":[],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/836395","id":"836395"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/836395/responses","id":"836395"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/836395/healthservices","id":"836395"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/836395/tags","id":"836395"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/y02627","id":"Y02627","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/worried","id":"worried"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/access%20to%20gp","id":"access to GP"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/access%20to%20vaccines","id":"access to vaccines"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/answering%20phones","id":"answering phones"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/antibiotics","id":"antibiotics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/asthma","id":"asthma"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/chest","id":"chest"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disabled","id":"disabled"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/inhaler","id":"inhaler"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20good","id":"not good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attitude","id":"staff attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid","id":"covid"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%2019","id":"covid 19"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/873787","id":"873787"}]},{"id":841377,"author":"hahajopo1","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Poor communication and attitude","body":"I had a cough just before Christmas (not Covid related) which lasted well over 6 weeks and the antibiotics did not work so after a telephone consult the doctor told me to go to the hospital for an x-ray and informed me I would not need to book an appointment and just turn up (which i did think was odd) so of course I assume the doctors must of booked an appointment for me, turn up at hospital no appointment available but luckily the staff at the hospital were really nice and still took me for a x-ray and tell me the results will be with my surgery in a few days.  \r\n4 weeks pass and I don't hear anything, I ring the surgery to see where my results are during the day and the person at reception cannot give me my results as its not the right time in the day (lol) but I could call back after work (4pm) to get my results then, so I ring again (after being put on hold for about 40mins) and get told by another person on reception that the first person should not of told me that and I would have to ring back in the morning and also they might not even have my results yet.

GP was great, listened and agreed to make referral.  \r\nScottish Autism have really let me down. The assessors on the panel were very old fashioned in their thinking of Autism presentations, being told from one of the panel they couldn't see it (i.e. my Autism?!) And because I had no (obvious) issues in childhood and I could communicate with the panel, therefore I can't be Autistic. I was laughed at for making notes, even though I need notes to remind me of what I wish to say, to help me. I was told to stop making notes and that it's not Autism, just poor self-esteem. Told to go home and chill out. Also told that I don't want this diagnosis anyway, as it would stay with me the rest of my life.  \r\nIf this practice is deemed acceptable, then I fear for all the other women who have been let down by their assessors. My health (mental and physical) has taken a turn for the worst since my assessment, due to the sheer frustration of being told I am not what I know myself to be. The assessors seem to think that a diagnosis is a bad/negative thing, when in actual fact, it would have helped me in understanding myself better and I could free myself from the guilt I've carried for the issues I've faced in the past.  \r\nI put in a complaint, and of course, the usual... they will learn from my experience! If that's the case, then why are there still women complaining about the very same things?  \r\nI didn't meet the diagnostic criteria... maybe then the diagnostic criteria needs looked at and altered to fit with the 21st century and the ever-changing medical field to include traits in women, as we all know they can be vastly different from the usual male presentations.  \r\nDeeply disappointed, lost, and will be complaining to the NHS about the service.

At this time visiting was allowed for 1 hour per day for one visitor. I thought her and the family's experience was a mixed one.  \r\nWhilst in AU1 there was very little communication with the family regarding her condition - When I called asking about my gran her NOK details were incorrect - a name no-one in my family has ever heard of. However the nurse I spoke with was very helpful on the phone and provided reassurance regarding my gran.  \r\nWhen she was moved to ward 42 we were not informed when this happened. The care she received in the ward was very good, especially by the physios. As I was my grans designated visitor I saw the progression in my grans mobility and her white board behind her bed was continually updated with her new mobility levels. The nurses were helpful regarding my grans discharge planning and kept me informed appropriately. They were very understanding and allowed me to take my gran down to the front door for fresh air when I visited which I believe increased my grans mood whilst in the hospital.  \r\nThe only annoying thing regarding the 1 hour visiting slot was that there were a few occasions when myself ( and other relatives) were waiting anywhere between 5 and 20 minutes before being allowed entry onto the ward. I understand the staff are busy during this time but it was frustrating when under a one hour time slot and as I work in a hospital based my visiting times off my shift start/end times.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-05-06T15:51:07.7033333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-05-10T09:20:01.94","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Fife","count":8},{"name":"Fife Health & Social Care Partnership","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/843952","id":"843952"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/843952/responses","id":"843952"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/843952/healthservices","id":"843952"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/843952/tags","id":"843952"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/f704h-admissions-1","id":"F704H-admissions-1","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/f704h-stroke","id":"f704h-stroke","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frustrating","id":"frustrating"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/discharge%20planning","id":"discharge planning"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good","id":"good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helpful","id":"helpful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hospital%20discharge","id":"hospital discharge"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mobility","id":"mobility"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurse","id":"nurse"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/patient%20notes","id":"patient notes"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/physio","id":"physio"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/physiotherapists","id":"physiotherapists"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/rehab","id":"rehab"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stroke","id":"stroke"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/understanding","id":"understanding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/visiting","id":"visiting"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassuring","id":"reassuring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/family%20kept%20informed","id":"family kept informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/access%20to%20fresh%20air","id":"access to fresh air"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/846003","id":"846003"}]},{"id":844075,"author":"Stiffy","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Lack of understanding","body":"After several weeks in Monklands hospital ( and a day in Hairmyres) for investigation of breathlessness -, it was discovered that my aortic stenosis was worse and that I also had some heart artery damage. &nbsp; I have undergone X-ray, MRI, echocardiogram, angiogram, respiratory testing, blood testing, urine testing.

He had left the accommodation 3 months ago (unhappy there; he owes them money) and has been living rough or sofa surfing. We suspect he has been selling sex. He was covered in bruises and scratches. He is well known to dealers in this area and they have exploited him over the years. He had been with them last night. We bathed him.  \r\nI emailed homeless team. They can see him in 3 days.  \r\nI phoned Mental Health Crisis Team who refused to come and see him. They acted rude, unprofessional and unhelpful. The first person I spoke to refused to give me their name.  \r\nMy adult daughter and I both have depression and anxiety. I have a diagnosis of PTSD. The ex neighbour, whilst really sweet, has a history of violence. There was no way I could keep him overnight but I couldn't throw him out. MH Crisis Team did not care that they were leaving a potentially violent male with 2 vulnerable women.  \r\nI phoned an ambulance and was told not to feed him because he needed his injection and food would affect it. He was starving.  \r\nAfter an hour the paramedics arrived. They said we could give him what we liked - very rude and dismissive.  \r\nThey talked to him and said that they had to make enquiries. After 20 minutes they came and \"talked\" to him. By that I mean towered over him and spoke aggressively and patronisingly about how he had made himself homeless; how he owed the housing association money ; how it was his fault he hadn't had his injection. I tried to explain that it was difficult for someone with his problems to do those things. They were adamant they would not take him to hospital and that he had to make his own way to his accommodation 40 miles away , at 10p.m. They were also unconcerned about leaving him with 2 vulnerable women. My anxiety was kicking in and I told them to leave.  \r\nMy daughter spoke to the supported accommodation and they agreed to have him back today. We found a local relative who agreed to let him sleep on his sofa for £20, pizza and snacks.  \r\nI am going to collect him now, by taxi, to take him to the supported accommodation. The round trip will cost me around £70. I am on Universal Credit.  \r\nI am disgusted at the lack of support for this vulnerable man and for my family.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-05-07T09:59:46.17","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-05-10T09:20:02.377","readBy":[{"name":"Barnet, Enfield and Haringey Mental Health NHS Trust x","count":1},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2021)","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/844212","id":"844212"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/844212/responses","id":"844212"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/844212/healthservices","id":"844212"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/844212/tags","id":"844212"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rrp_10001","id":"RRP_10001","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rrp_710h","id":"RRP_710h","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rru","id":"RRU","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lack%20of%20care","id":"Lack of care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/patient%20transport","id":"patient transport"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/patronising","id":"patronising"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professionalism","id":"professionalism"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/rude","id":"rude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/schizophrenia","id":"schizophrenia"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unhelpful","id":"unhelpful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/conflicting%20information","id":"conflicting information"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/846185","id":"846185"}]},{"id":844222,"author":"Doodledame","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"A recent hospital stay in Queen Alexandra's Hospital Portsmouth","body":"I was blue lighted into hospital one day mid April on the verge of an adrenal crisis due to being unwell.

His nose was bleeding but there was blood everywhere and it was difficult to ascertain where it was coming from as his teeth and mouth were covered in blood too. I first phoned NHS24 on 111, and after a long automated Covid message I was told to hang up now and contact my GP  \r\nI noted that the surgery would still be open as it was 5.40pm and still within opening hours. I spoke to someone at my GPs who told me there was nothing she could do and she said she didn't know why I got that message as I really needed to phone 111 as it would be minor injuries I needed. I asked her several times if there was anyone there who could see my son and she said no but she told me I could ring minor injuries directly.  \r\nMy son was still very distressed but fortunately my husband had arrived home, it was now 5.50pm. Having broken my ankle 6wks previously, my mobility in the moonboot was hindered. I phoned minor injuries at Stirling and spoke to someone who asked if I had spoken to someone at NHS 24, I explained what had happened. He said I would need to call back 111 in order to be triaged online and then probably booked in to come to Stirling.  \r\nThe time was now 5.55pm. My son was being reassured and beginning to calm and his nosebleed had stopped. We were also now reassured that there was no bleeding from his mouth, teeth or anywhere else. (both work first aiders) Having telephoned 111 again, listened to the automated Covid conversation again I was then triaged and told to take my son to A&E within the next hour. We went straight there following the instructions. We arrived and it was very busy, the nurse at the 1st reception told me that someone would see my son and determine whether he would have to be checked over by a doctor or if we could go instead to Urgent Care as they were very busy and we might be seen sooner.  \r\nAfter an hour or so we saw a member of staff who gave our son a check over, I asked if it would be possible to go to Urgent Care and she said, she would prefer him to get checked over by the doctor as he was looking a bit peaky. She did however suggest that if we could get him looking more perky within the hour then it would be possible. I relayed this to my husband, and we got to work reassuring and distracting, as we were sure that he was just a little scared, but had not, in our limited knowledge, shown any of the obvious worries associated with a bash to the head. No sickness, no dizziness, no confusion etc  \r\nAt 8pm, the A&E dept was still very busy, with injured people arriving all the time, and the staff were very obviously doing their best but the board said waiting time was 6hrs. With a now, very hungry son and husband I approached the person we saw earlier to ask if my son could now go to Urgent Care as he seemed much better within himself. I was then told, 'Urgent Care have no appointments and I should probably have said that earlier\"  \r\nWe waited another hour (9pm) and I approached the 1st reception to ask if it was ok if we took my son home as he was feeling well, but hungry and tired. I said I was sensible and prepared to keep an eye on him and if I had any concerns then I would bring him back straight away. She said there were 4 more people in front of him but she had no idea how long this would take. She checked with the consultant and that was fine to go.  \r\nAt 9pm we left for home. This morning an A&E doctor telephoned me to ask after our son as there were no notes detailing what had happened to him and at first I thought I was going to get told off for taking him home. I was reassured with an apology for the long wait, and delighted that he suggested we come back to check there was no gravel in his face today. We did this and after an hour was delighted that an A&E doctor was able to clean him up and treat his injuries. We left with some medicine and a bundle of reassurance.  \r\nMy story is written to ask for some consideration to a more joined up service approach. The mixed and confusing messages given by the GP receptionist and indeed the recorded message at NHS24. At that anxious time, all a parent is looking for is direction to the best medical attention as soon and as quickly as possible, not to be passed from pillar to post with each department saying, ' No I'm not het for this one' I am sure it is more complex than this, but it would be good if the services could work together to make better outcomes. Thanks again to the staff at Forth Valley for their attention in what are stretched and difficult times.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-04-20T14:01:12.3866667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-05-10T09:59:03.937","readBy":[{"name":"NHS 24","count":34},{"name":"NHS Forth Valley","count":13}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/840451","id":"840451"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/840451/responses","id":"840451"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/840451/healthservices","id":"840451"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/840451/tags","id":"840451"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/forth-valley-royal-ae","id":"forth-valley-royal-ae","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/forth-valley-royal-mias","id":"forth-valley-royal-mias","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/forth-valley-royal-urgentcare","id":"forth-valley-royal-urgentcare","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/nhs24-111","id":"NHS24-111","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sv9-gp","id":"sv9-gp","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxious","id":"anxious"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frustrated","id":"frustrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20being%20listened%20to","id":"not being listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20listened%20to","id":"not listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/attention","id":"attention"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood","id":"blood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication%20between%20services","id":"communication between services"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disinterest","id":"disinterest"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dizziness","id":"dizziness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctor","id":"doctor"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/face","id":"face"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fall","id":"fall"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/follow%20up","id":"follow up"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hard%20working","id":"hard working"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/head","id":"head"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/joined%20up%20care","id":"joined up care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nose","id":"nose"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/notes","id":"notes"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassurance","id":"reassurance"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/teeth","id":"teeth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/follow%20procedure","id":"follow procedure"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/845202","id":"845202"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/847133","id":"847133"}]},{"id":844255,"author":"Rhona D","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"X-ray department","body":"My sister mistakenly went to the wrong hospital for a scan when we should have been at Wishaw.

On a number of occasions we have had to deal with rude, unpleasant staff on reception. Don’t get me wrong there are staff who would go out of their way to help you, but at other times it's a different story. A family member has a rare condition, needing specialist medicine. This seems too much for them to handle as there always seems to be a problem with prescriptions, or they are causing us stress that isn’t needed! Time after time I have felt patronised by staff, so why is it ok for them to talk to us this way but as soon as you give it back it’s not allowed? I have also heard a member of staff speaking badly about me as a parent.Today I had confronted them about a prescription as my partner had called to change the mg of tablets and was told no they weren’t doing it, it wasn’t possible. I arrived at the practice to find out why this was as I couldn’t be bothered with the rudeness of staff over the phone, to which I was greeted by a hostile staff member who called my partner a liar and said they had actually passed it to the doctor to see if this could be done and to contact the hospital to send an email to them. So why tell my partner one thing and me the other? Why can it not be straightforward enough to tell us they would do what they can and offer to call the hospital. The way we are continually treated by staff is shocking, it’s a shame we can’t move doctors practice as this is the only one in our area.  \r\nWe as a family go through so much with caring responsibilities and don’t need this kind of attitude every single time we contact the doctors surgery. It puts you off even asking them for anything or even help.

My consultant, Dr. Wright and his registrar Dr. Anderson were very tentative, they listened to my concerns and fully assessed my symptoms, one of the great things about this diagnostic appointment was the ability for Dr. Wright to carry out ultrasounds of my joints then and there and explain what the presence of enthesitis meant.  \r\nAs I tried to get my head around a diagnosis of a lifelong condition, I worried about my care and starting treatment in the middle of a pandemic. However, all my fears have been allayed. Despite the impact of Covid, redeployments, virtual appointments etc. The rheumy team have been absolutely fantastic, the Rheumatology Helpline is such a lifeline and I’ve been completely supported over the last few months.  \r\nI had a face to face appointment with my Rheumatology Specialist Nurse today, Anne, who is just fabulous and has offered me so much support since diagnosis. She is so knowledgeable about the disease, and listens with a caring, empathetic ear and offers sound, evidence based, constructive and reassuring advice in terms of what to do, what to expect and what the next plan of action is. She was supported today by staff nurse Una who really helped me feel at ease and supported. Even the ward clerk, as I awaited my appointment, was so friendly and welcoming.  \r\nThe shared care between my GP and the team has been very clear and executed without issue. I know that there is no magic wand that can be waved to send my PsA into remission and at the minute I’m so so sore, tired and fed up from it, but I don’t feel alone. I feel very much in capable, caring hands with a great consultant and specialist nurse and their team and I trust the careplan they have agreed with me as we try various medications to get the disease under control.

I accepted Wansbeck as it was the first available appointment offered and I was told by my GP that everything would be done today and I would get some results. After travelling for an hour and arriving in time for my appointment. I was shown in and met the consultant who examined me. After 2 or 3 minutes I was advised I would need a mammogram a CT scan and a biopsy and told me to make an appointment. I was informed that I could probably get one for that Thursday as there was no one in the radiology dept today to do anything!One stop meant no stop. I have a perfectly good hospital 10 minutes from my home but it is not a one-stop clinic. Needless to say I was extremely upset after spending 2 weeks worrying. I have an appointment on Tuesday at my local hospital with the x ray dept. Let’s hope they have staff to do the necessary test. I cannot believe they allowed me to travel for an hour to be told no more than my own GP had told me. I have no desire to go back to Wansbeck. I have no confidence in them so hopefully I will be able to get the tests and any treatment somewhere they at least tell you in advance if your journey will be wasted.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-05-07T13:43:01.0433333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-05-10T11:30:39.42","readBy":[{"name":"Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/844327","id":"844327"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/844327/responses","id":"844327"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/844327/healthservices","id":"844327"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/844327/tags","id":"844327"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rtfed_103","id":"RTFED_103","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20good","id":"not good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/radiology","id":"radiology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/service%20availability","id":"service availability"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/test","id":"test"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tests","id":"tests"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/time%20wasted","id":"time wasted"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/x%20ray","id":"x ray"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/x-ray","id":"X-ray"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/no%20confidence","id":"no confidence"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/no%20hope","id":"no hope"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/844900","id":"844900"}]},{"id":844328,"author":"vegatd83","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Absolutely excellent care","body":"I thought I'd leave some feedback about the district nurses.  \r\nI'd never met any of the girls before but they have been excellent, absolutely excellent.

I was also told the site is well served by public transport - I looked into the options using the website suggested and my options were 2 bus journeys totalling nearly 2 hours of travel time and would arrive nearly an hour before my appointment or 15 minutes afterwards. The train was quicker however involved 3 changes and would have been expensive (approximately £17). I chose to drive as the car journey was only 25 minutes however on arrival I could not find a parking space (despite arriving 30 minutes early, planning to spend the extra time listening to the car radio to clam myself). I drove around the local area and found somewhere to park which was about a 10 minute walk away - that ate up all the extra time I had allowed myself to relax before the procedure.  \r\nI arrived feeling like an anxious wreck however the staff were very welcoming and I was checked in smoothly. I was taken for my appointment not long after arriving and had a warm introduction to the Doctor who would be carrying out the procedure and her assistant. Everything was explained in plain English and I was given time to sort myself out.  \r\nThe procedure was uncomfortable and unpleasant however the edge was taken off this by the caring nature of the assistant who helped maintain a relaxed atmosphere throughout. At each stage I was told what to expect and had reassurance from the assistant. Overall I managed to stay relatively calm - surprising even myself.  \r\nAfterwards I was given ample time to composes myself and had aftercare clearly explained - twice in fact as I didn't take it all in the first time and I had to ask them to repeat it which they did without judgement or comment.  \r\nI am in some discomfort however I was told to expect this and I know the signs to look out for should an infection occur, I also feel reassured that should I need to call for help the Doctor will answer my queries.  \r\n[Unhappy with 'Waiting time']  \r\n[Very happy with 'Cleanliness']  \r\n[Very happy with 'Seeing the whole me']  \r\n[Happy with 'Introductions']","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-05-07T15:25:22.2166667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-05-10T11:48:43.75","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lothian","count":5},{"name":"Ulster University, MBBS (Medicine) 2021","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/844349","id":"844349"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/844349/responses","id":"844349"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/844349/healthservices","id":"844349"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/844349/tags","id":"844349"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/s308h_502","id":"S308H_502","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxious","id":"anxious"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/aftercare","id":"aftercare"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/colposcopy","id":"colposcopy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helped","id":"helped"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/parking","id":"parking"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/signs","id":"signs"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/smear%20test","id":"smear test"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/test","id":"test"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/uncomfortable","id":"uncomfortable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/welcoming","id":"welcoming"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/calm","id":"calm"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/explanations","id":"explanations"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/transport%20advice","id":"transport advice"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confusing%20letters","id":"confusing letters"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/847302","id":"847302"}]},{"id":831811,"author":"reticulumwd44","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Telephones at GP","body":"My GP practice has been getting work done on their phone system.

It is very different now with the support staff becoming the gatekeepers and dare I say some are very indifferent to a patients concerns and rather trying to offer alternatives they feel justified  keeping the patients at bay by giving poor excuses that the Dr's are just unavailable. There isn't a particular shortage of Drs but many are now just part time. It is impossible to give a a quality of service to patients on part time hours. It just isn't possible. Our old style Dr's were worth their weight in gold, respected citizens of communities the nation over. GP Practices have slipped in their standards of care and Latham House is an example of what is going on nationwide.

I was helpfully updated by the consultant on my hasty journey across the country from Lincoln. With a very guarded prognosis, and rapid deterioration, the A&E team, surgeon, anaesthetist and ICU Dr respected him as an individual as we conveyed the greater-than-average aspirations of this octogenarian.  \r\nHe was transferred the intensive care unit following surgery and sadly died on his 9th day. During the time in ICU we were updated every day by the wonderfully kind Comms team. The ICU nursing staff went the extra mile to ensure they got to know about my father, playing his favourite jazz music and YouTube music of his granddaughter singing. They facilitated video calls (due to COVID restrictions) and anticipated our needs for kindness and information as much as they applied their shills to his care. They anticipated our spiritual needs and arranged for their wonderful chaplain to visit.  \r\nSadly, the complications of his illness were too great to overcome and my father died with me and my mother in attendance on the evening of 4th May. We were supported by the chaplain and his wonderful nurses during the most difficult goodbye.  \r\nI am a healthcare professional, so accustomed to being on the other side of the care and conversations. The thoughtfulness and attention to detail was under my professional scrutiny, and it did not disappoint.  \r\nOur whole family are so grateful to everyone involved in his pathway from the front door of A&E, to his final breaths on ICU.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-05-07T16:22:29.4266667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-05-10T13:05:46.487","readBy":[{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2021)","count":1},{"name":"Healthwatch Oldham","count":1},{"name":"Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS Trust","count":1},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2022)","count":1},{"name":"Plymouth University, MClinRes 2021","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/844360","id":"844360"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/844360/responses","id":"844360"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/844360/healthservices","id":"844360"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/844360/tags","id":"844360"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rw603_100","id":"RW603_100","score":5},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rw603_180","id":"RW603_180","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rw603_300","id":"RW603_300","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/abdominal","id":"abdominal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/accident","id":"accident"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bowel%20surgery","id":"Bowel surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency","id":"emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency%20care","id":"emergency care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/end%20of%20life","id":"end of life"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/family%20support","id":"family support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/intensive%20care%20unit","id":"intensive care unit"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kept%20informed","id":"kept informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kindness","id":"kindness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/person-centred","id":"person-centred"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/respected","id":"respected"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thoughtfulness","id":"thoughtfulness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassionate","id":"compassionate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported","id":"supported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid","id":"covid"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/845830","id":"845830"}]},{"id":844457,"author":"statusxt73","authorRoleId":8,"authorRole":"a staff member posting for a patient/service user","title":"Covid vaccination","body":"Had my 2nd vaccine in Foyle Arena.

I was able to stay with her until she was settled and we knew what was happening. We were apprehensive that I wouldn’t be able to stay with her at admission but this was no problem what so ever.  \r\nOn the Tuesday her labour had started and was moved late morning to labour ward. They ensured my wife was able to get her epidural in a timely manner without delay. This meant she was more comfortable as the day went on. The midwife Hannah in labour ward was lovely. She kept us updated, well informed and gave us a few wee laughs along the way. They even made sure I was well looked after! Making me coffee and giving me lunch and dinner too. Nothing was too much trouble for us. They made us feel safe and gave us lots of good chat too!  \r\nUnfortunately Hannah couldn’t stay with us as my wife’s labour progressed and we met the night shift team - the midwife Monica and student midwife Lisa. They were great too. Again like the rest of the staff they immediately made us feel at ease and were so down to earth.  \r\nWe were so impressed with the student midwife. She led the delivery and helped bring our lovely new baby girl into the world.  \r\nAfter the birth, the amazing care continued. The tea and toast was great. They didn’t rush me away and allowed us to have a precious few hours together as a family.  \r\nThe midwives were a true credit to their profession.

I wish it was an isolated case with an individual nurse but each one I dealt with was as uncaring as the next. The doctor who done the rounds spoke to me as if I was a 3 year old toddler that had no concept of my condition or medical terminology. The whole admission and stay was a complete and utter waste of everyone’s time and could have been resolved with a bit more communication at the time decisions were made.  \r\nI’ve never been made feel more of a hindrance in a hospital environment than I did in that ward. Like I said, totally understand the job is horrific and the pressure is grand, but surely the profession requires an element of bedside manner. I had one HCA who was utterly wonderful and I just couldn’t understand why the rest were utterly dreadful. The porters, HCA’s & all doctors and nurses in A&E were absolutely wonderful (including a nurse who was so kind). Perhaps the professionalism in A&E set the bar too high.  \r\nThis has undoubtedly made me feel that I will refrain so much more from calling 111 when there may be an issue, if it means being treated like I am a massive inconvenience.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-05-07T21:51:37.2266667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-05-10T14:16:07.827","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lanarkshire","count":8},{"name":"Scottish Government","count":1},{"name":"Voluntary Action North Lanarkshire","count":1},{"name":"North Lanarkshire Health & Social Care Partnership","count":1},{"name":"Partnership for Change","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/844455","id":"844455"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/844455/responses","id":"844455"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/844455/healthservices","id":"844455"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/844455/tags","id":"844455"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l106h-amru","id":"l106h-amru","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/inconvenience","id":"inconvenience"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/isolated","id":"isolated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/patronised","id":"patronised"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/uncaring","id":"uncaring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/a&e","id":"a&e"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/attitude","id":"attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bedside%20manner","id":"bedside manner"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cardiac","id":"cardiac"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/health%20care%20assistants","id":"Health Care Assistants"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/infection","id":"infection"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kindness","id":"kindness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurse","id":"nurse"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/porters","id":"porters"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/rude%20staff","id":"rude staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dreadful","id":"dreadful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/under%20pressure","id":"under pressure"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/846363","id":"846363"}]},{"id":844930,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Best Practice","body":"I have nothing but praise for the entire staff of Valley Road.

At the time it was reccomend on my notes that I be scanned earlier than 12 weeks to monitor growth of my twins, this did not happen. Devastatingly at my 12 week scan ( done at 13 weeks) we were told that one of our babies had not made it. At this appointment I was ensured I would be contacted by a specialist nurse for blood testing as the normal tests would not work following the loss of a twin, however again this did not happen. I wrongly assumed that I would be offered extra scans following a loss but was told this was not done, resulting in us paying for private scans to offer us any reassurance that my remaining baby was ok. I never seen the same community midwife throughout my pregnancy, there was no consistency in my care.  \r\nMy stepdaughter has a rare genetic condition that my partner is a known carrier for and when I expressed concerns with regards to this at appointments this was wholly dismissed. When I enquired about the specialised test I was supposed to have, I was informed that \"Its too late now\". I suffered from hyperemesis throughout my pregnancy and was hospitalized several times for this due to dehydration. On one occasion towards the end of my pregnancy my bump was not measured due to lack of a tape measure resulting in my next appointment being informed that my baby had not grown in one month resulting in me being sent for an urgent scan the following day to be informed my baby was fine, and weighed 9lb.  \r\nAt no point was my birth plan discussed or completed my wishes were never considered. I was induced following an admission due to reduced movement at 6 days overdue. After 16 hours of labour my son had became stuck and I had a surgical procedure to deliver him. Due to retaining both placentas I bled excessively after this which left me very poorly. My son was thankfully born healthy and well which I am grateful for.  \r\nOn the maternity ward later that evening I was delighted to overhear a conversation between 2 care assistants complain about the noise earlier in the day from the induction suite, one of which was me and this same care assistant when I was attempting to breast feed my son barked at me that I \"was doing it wrong\" then left. The following day I was informed I required a blood transfusion that I refused as I just wanted home with my son due to the difficulties I had throughout.  \r\nOn my discharge I was told I would be referred to a physio as my son was 9lb 4, once again this has never materialised. My care in the community was much better with the exception of my sons health visitor visits. His first health visitor was fantastic but after she moved areas the visits stopped and my son has not been seen since he was 4 months old, he is now 2. This in itself is alarming, but I'm fortunate that he is thriving. All of this has resulted in physical problems that are starting to materialize for myself now. However the greatest impact my pregnancy and birth experience has had is on my family. Due to the lack of care, communication, understanding and negligence we have decided as a not to expand our family further. This has been devastating and difficult to come to terms with as the inaction of multiple others has impacted on my families life in a massive way.  \r\nI do not wish my story to be used as a \"learning experience\" as it is clear that my issues were widespread and require more action than that. I have written this as I hope that after 2 years something that I am only just coming to terms with, finally someone hears my voice, and actually listens.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-05-07T22:05:31.42","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-05-10T14:20:25.833","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Ayrshire & Arran","count":6}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/844456","id":"844456"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/844456/responses","id":"844456"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/844456/healthservices","id":"844456"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/844456/tags","id":"844456"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/a111h_501","id":"A111H_501","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sa9-community-services-hv","id":"SA9-community-services-hv","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lack%20of%20care","id":"Lack of care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/birth%20plan","id":"birth plan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breastfeeding%20support","id":"Breastfeeding Support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/continuity%20of%20care","id":"continuity of care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dismissed","id":"dismissed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/follow%20up","id":"follow up"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/labour","id":"labour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/listening","id":"listening"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/monitoring","id":"monitoring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pregnancy","id":"pregnancy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/referral","id":"referral"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/understanding","id":"understanding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unheard","id":"unheard"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/more%20consistency","id":"more consistency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/involved%20in%20decisions","id":"involved in decisions"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care%20assistants","id":"care assistants"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/better%20communication","id":"better communication"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/844944","id":"844944"}]},{"id":842532,"author":"JMAC1","authorRoleId":4,"authorRole":"a relative","title":"Home Care","body":"Monklands Home Care Team came out to attend to my elderly mother.

I just wanted to highlight the exceptional care we received there both antenatally and postnatally everyone has been amazing. However it was during labour that we had two wonderful midwives Joanne and Sharon who helped bring our beautiful baby boy into the world. Shortly after his birth there were some concerns from my husband and myself along with the midwives that our baby had Down’s syndrome. This was later confirmed a few days later. However how this was handled in Lagan Valley was done so with the utmost respect and empathy during a very anxious, shocking and uncertain time for us. The Sister Claire squeezes my hand and gave me a hug. No words were needed but I’ll never forget that act of kindness that told me everything would be ok.  \r\nWe had to be transferred to the Ulster neonatal unit. This was something I always wanted to avoid and knew this was a possibly when giving birth in Lagan Valley. However the staff at the Ulster maternity unit and neonatal unit again went above and beyond in terms of their support and guidance. We were there five days and again I was so impressed with the standard of care we received from everyone. From the nurse who sat with my husband which he cried to the midwife who sat and listened to my fears and anxiety in the small hours of the morning as well as all the Breastfeeding support and guidance.  \r\nWe left the Ulster with a much more positive outlook for the future. People don’t always take the time to celebrate the positive experiences they have - much more likely to jump in and complain. I just wanted to say thank you to the entire team of paediatricians; midwives, neonatal nurses and health care workers who went above and beyond their job roles during our stay.  \r\nWe have been home two weeks nearly and are just loving the new addition to our family and enjoying every second.

All the nurses showed professionalism by introducing themselves and complying with PPE, nothing was too much trouble.  \r\nI would like to acknowledge a certain member within the department Dr Marc who I believe was a registrar. When Marc came to review my son he listened to not only my concerns but also my sons concerns and acted appropriately to offer reassurance. Marc demonstrated professionalism and had a natural ability through effective communication skills to make my son feel relaxed. Marc was attentive, supportive and most of all what a doctor should be caring and compassionate. I left the department knowing what I had to look out for and reassured should anything change to present at the department. Thank you and please continue to look after the kids the way you do.
