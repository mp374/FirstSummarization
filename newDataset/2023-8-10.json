[{"id":1102260,"author":"Orian38","authorRoleId":4,"authorRole":"a relative","title":"You are truly wonderful and we are so grateful for all you have done","body":"Unfortunately this story does not have a happy ever after ending as despite all that was done to help Mum after an accident in her home, Mum was unable to recover and passed away in hospital.  \r\nFrom every member of staff the care Mum and our family received was excellent, the information provided and frequency of communication was ideal; we were kept updated as soon as new information was available or when decisions on care options were available. When Mum became unable to communicate her choices, our views were sought and respected at all times and always without any delay or pressure.  \r\nMum had arranged many years ago when she was in her 50's for me to be her power of attorney, though in her 80's she remained independent at home and was still very much able to make her own decisions. We had also had the very difficult conversations about what Mum's wishes were if she became ill or was at end of life. If you are reading this and have not yet arranged your power of attorney or even tried to have those hard discussions, please do so as soon as possible - it makes even the hardest of decisions a little more comforting.  \r\nThe family members including myself who were with mum at home and in hospital were cared for with so much kindness and sensitivity we agreed that it was important for us to publicly thank the staff.  \r\nThe two paramedics from Scottish Ambulance Service kept Mum's spirits up, even though she was distressed and very much in pain. They told her very calmly and clearly what was happening and made mum laugh heartedly in the ambulance despite how scared she was.  \r\nThe nurse in the Emergency Department Trauma area was wonderful, as were the medical staff who actively treated mum in the hope she would improve.  \r\nOn moving through to the Combined Assessment Area for further treatment, the nurse allocated to care for Mum, who was in Lime Zone Room 11, was attentive, caring and took time to explain everything that was happening to Mum even when she was sleepy, and with his colleagues made sure we were cared for too with offers of food, water, hot drinks and lots of information and reassurance. The medical staff here too were wonderful, it was clear that they were very well briefed from their ED colleagues and consulted us at every stage in Mum's treatment - I really didn't mind telling the circumstances of Mum's accident to each of them as it was clear it was vital for them to assess and treat Mum the best way.  \r\nThe next evening Mum deteriorated and while it may be easy to say we all die sometime - for Mum she could only die this once. The lovely care Mum and her family received during her final hours will stay firmly in our hearts for ever. Mum had a lovely death - she had hugs from her Grandchildren, her daughters, daughter in law and son in law - she was comfortable and with her family. Thank you to the staff of Scottish Ambulance Service, the Emergency Department and Combined Assessment Unit at Crosshouse Hospital, you are truly wonderful and we are so grateful for all you have done.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-08-09T17:12:06.0233333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-08-10T07:33:07.51","readBy":[{"name":"Scottish Ambulance Service","count":4},{"name":"NHS Ayrshire & Arran","count":6}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1102260","id":"1102260"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1102260/responses","id":"1102260"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1102260/healthservices","id":"1102260"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1102260/tags","id":"1102260"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/a111h_180","id":"A111H_180","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/a111h-cau","id":"A111H-CAU","score":5},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/scot-ambulance-emergency","id":"scot-ambulance-emergency","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/accident","id":"accident"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/attentive","id":"attentive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care%20of%20the%20dying","id":"care of the dying"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/death","id":"death"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency","id":"emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/end%20of%20life","id":"end of life"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/family%20support","id":"family support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/informed","id":"informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kindness","id":"kindness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/paramedics","id":"paramedics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/passed%20away","id":"passed away"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/respected","id":"respected"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/safe","id":"safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sensitivity","id":"sensitivity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20for","id":"cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported","id":"supported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thankful","id":"Thankful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wonderful%20staff","id":"wonderful staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/choices","id":"choices"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/excellent%20care%20provision","id":"excellent care provision"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1102741","id":"1102741"}]},{"id":1101983,"author":"sambaks79","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Felt like my emotions or feelings weren't considered","body":"Last week I was advised to attend the A23 unit at Queens Medical Centre, as I has been up all night with back pain and spotting. I went in and everyone I came into contact with was lovely, and very helpful. During the scan I was measuring at 5 weeks 5 days pregnant (I thought I was 8 weeks based on LMP), they couldn't see a heartbeat, however explained that they would book me in for 2 weeks' time to check again. The ladies doing the scan were really helpful, and answered any questions me and my partner had.  \r\nA couple of days later, I woke up to a gush of blood and went into A&E, where I was transferred to Unit A23 again. After 30 minutes I saw a nurse who was lovely and pleasant and was able to put me at ease whilst asking questions and taking my bloods. The nurse explained that due to my history with my cervix the doctor might want to have a look to make sure everything was OK, but advised that my wait would be a long one as it was the weekend. Me and my partner understood this so agreed to wait.  \r\nAfter 2 and a half hours, we were called in by a Gyno consult who said very matter-of-factly that this is a case of wait and see, and we should go home and let nature run its course if I'm miscarrying. After 3 hours in hospital, I felt extremely dismissed and fobbed off and with this being my first pregnancy felt like my emotions or feelings weren't considered. I then asked if based on my notes the doctor would like to have an internal look at my cervix, to which they replied that it wouldn't give us any answers and I should just wait for my scan in 2 weeks.  \r\nI now have a week to wait, and I feel as though I don't know what to do. I went home very sure that I'm miscarrying and any hope has gone.  \r\nI just wanted to provide my experience to remind doctors that what they say matters and will stay with someone. Every nurse I have come across has been fantastic, and all conversations over the phone have been really helpful. But the lack of understanding from this Gyno consult felt like a punch in the face after a very hard few days and morning of waiting.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-08-09T05:33:55.16","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-08-10T08:28:12.003","readBy":[{"name":"Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust","count":1},{"name":"The Miscarriage Association","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1101983","id":"1101983"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1101983/responses","id":"1101983"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1101983/healthservices","id":"1101983"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1101983/tags","id":"1101983"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rx1ra_501","id":"RX1RA_501","score":3},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rx1ra_502","id":"RX1RA_502","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back%20pain","id":"back pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood","id":"blood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cervix","id":"cervix"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dismissed","id":"dismissed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/distressed","id":"distressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/miscarriage","id":"miscarriage"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pregnancy","id":"pregnancy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pregnant","id":"pregnant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scan","id":"scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20at%20ease","id":"put at ease"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1103190","id":"1103190"}]},{"id":1102766,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Serious overhaul needed","body":"I attend the blood taking service on a regular basis.

In the late 90's, I had severe clinical depression and they helped me sympathetically and competently through that.

I have consulted with all of them and they have all been effective, sympathetic and highly competent.  The practice has excellent resident nursing staff and they have checked my bp, conducted diabetes checks and taken blood on numerous occasions.  I am quite difficult to take blood from and often leave other clinics with more holes than a pin cushion but the nurses here almost always score a 'hole in one'.

On occasion, while waiting to see a doctor, I have observed the way they deal with a potentially difficult situation and learned lessons to apply in my own career.\r\nThis practice must easily be in the top ten percent of all practices in the United Kingdom.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2023-08-08T12:09:57","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-08-10T08:43:30","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1102770","id":"1102770"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1102770/responses","id":"1102770"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1102770/healthservices","id":"1102770"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1102770/tags","id":"1102770"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/e84701","id":"E84701","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood","id":"blood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20pressure","id":"blood pressure"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/depression","id":"depression"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diabetes","id":"diabetes"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diabetes%20type%202","id":"diabetes type 2"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helped","id":"helped"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20good","id":"not good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/strong","id":"strong"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/in%20the%20way","id":"in the way"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/under%20pressure","id":"under pressure"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1103823","id":"1103823"}]},{"id":1102768,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Excellent Care at A&E","body":"My husband had an A&E appointment after calling 111.

Couldn't fault them as a team.  \r\nBut on the bad side, the ward was in need of a complete refurbishment and updating as the whole area was so out dated, in my view.  \r\nThe main issues was as follows:  \r\nAir Bed/mattress- so uncomfortable and not really easily to move on, not fit for purposes for the patients or nurses, in my opinion. The beds in the ICU unit would be a lot better as these was so much comfortable and gave move stability and a lot more easy to move around on. Plus if all the bed was the same I think it would be more cost efficient and save in the long as all the beds would be the same where at present u have 2 sorts. Being short it took for me to call the nurse every time i need to get out of bed cause there is no function on the patient remove to change the height of the bed, cause with this bed if it's too low the mattress doesn't inflate correct if too low. Which took the nurse away from patient that could need them for an more urgent issue.  \r\nChairs - being the larger person i could not fit in the chairs on the ward so I couldn't sit out of bed, there this is not good for recovery. The chair also in the icu are perfect and should be used on the ward as these are perfect for the larger person.  \r\nOne plug socket per bed - I think this is so out dated when some of the beds need 2 per bed along with all the other pumps and equipment need to be plugged in. Having to use extension lead also can cause issue with trip hazards not only to staff but patients.  \r\nTV/radio monitors - although in place was all out of order so no entertainment was available and there was no access to the hospital WiFi on the ward so I end up having to use my own mobile data and phone to listen to music or watch TV on.  \r\nOver head lights - whilst my stay and patient move the light on the wall and it fell down so they left it, only to be check but a nurse in the morning to find it had nearly fell out of the wall. Spot light in the ceil would be better than stuff having off the walls.  \r\nCall buttons - not all call buttons on the wall was lighting up near the beds so the nurses wasn't sure who need help. To help this would it be an idea to put a red light strip around the curtain rails so they can clearly see that patients need helps faster.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-08-09T09:33:21.6966667","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2023-08-10T09:22:12.303","readBy":[{"name":"United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust","count":5}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1102051","id":"1102051"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1102051/responses","id":"1102051"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1102051/healthservices","id":"1102051"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1102051/tags","id":"1102051"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rwdla_100","id":"RWDLA_100","score":4},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing%20staff","id":"amazing staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/beds","id":"beds"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/facilities","id":"facilities"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/the%20change","id":"the change"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/uncomfortable","id":"uncomfortable"}]},{"id":1102046,"author":"Charnap07","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"It was an amazing experience","body":"Surgery to repair hernia, staff were amazing, very chirpy and very happy, it was an amazing experience, especially because I was scared and nervous, but after seeing them it was no problem, calm and told everything that was happening","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-08-09T09:20:48.18","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-08-10T09:25:06.247","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Tayside","count":5}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1102046","id":"1102046"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1102046/responses","id":"1102046"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1102046/healthservices","id":"1102046"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1102046/tags","id":"1102046"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/t312h-general-surgery-su","id":"t312h-general-surgery-su","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing%20staff","id":"amazing staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hernia%20repair","id":"hernia repair"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20helpful","id":"very helpful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting%20list","id":"waiting list"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20at%20ease","id":"put at ease"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1103004","id":"1103004"}]},{"id":1102806,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Phenomenal service ","body":"Attended the urgent care and they could not be more helpful, knowledgeable and seen swiftly.

I also had my key worker Michelle, who is great.  \r\nI was nervous, but the other people like me, the clients, were so nice, we all had a problem with enjoying alcohol excessively. It was a serious problem for all of us and we were here to fix it. We were alcoholics. There, I've said it, it's something that is very hard to admit. It feels shameful, but it's a hugely common problem and we should try to lose our shame and just fix it, yet still I write anonymously.  \r\nWe had 2 weeks of informal, relaxed, supportive care from the team members above to help us, including medication to help withdrawal, vitamin injections to help us thrive and acupuncture to help with our anxiety (all optional). But most importantly, we bonded with each of them, as all had great passion and a drive to help us. We also bonded with each other.  \r\nWe ended the 2 week program with a wonderful graduation event, where our family and friends were invited to join us to celebrate our achievement.  \r\nSuch was our delight with the support we received on the program, each of us in our group (CGL clients), decided we would speak and feedback about one member each of our core team. I was nominated by the other clients to feedback on (CC) and I was delighted to do so on the day and decided I'd share all of this great support from everyone and the feedback I provided on CC here, so that future clients have confidence with the people who are supporting you.  \r\nCC was exceptional - she is authentic, resilient, passionate, innovative and has great charisma, which makes others want to follow her, the key characteristics of a future leader.  \r\nShe inspires and encourages, whilst demonstrating empathy. She has a natural knack of connecting positively with others.  \r\nShe came up with great ideas such as introducing video clips from us to make our graduation more interactive for the whole audience. She chose songs to kick off the proceedings which really hit at the hearts of all in the room, many of us in tears. They were beautiful choices which told stories of difficult journeys which were so apt for the occasion.  \r\nShe pushed out all the stops to help decorate the room and transform a boring office space into a super celebration event. Her desire and drive to make this a fantastic day for all was infectious and certainly paid off.  \r\nBut where she really had the opportunity to shine was as the key host/speaker of our graduation event. She is a complete natural, her public speaking skills should be exploited to their full potential and were I a leader of CGL, I would be utilising those skills at every opportunity. She connects with the audience in a way which engages and delights and her great passion as I said is infectious.

My dad was supposed to have a telephone appointment and after 30mins no call, I gave reception a ring first to confirm it is telephone and 2nd that it is normal for this to be happening which reception told me the consultant was only running late. After an hour , I called again then found out it was supposed to be face to face. I have already confirmed with booking team for clarification since the initial letter did say it was face to face but new digital letters and messages sent have been updated to say that it is telephone (have multiple screenshot and messages sent). I have received a confirm message yesterday as well which I confirmed for the telephone consultation to attend as usual and the number that will be called is the correct one. I'm left to leave this review since we have already been messed around so much before, it's either lack of communication and there would be telephone appointments arranged with no notice last year which left with no appointment being conducted because an interpretator was required and my dad have not been seen by the diabetic centre since the time a telephone appointment was arranged without notice till now which is like 1-2 years atleast. Please, if you value your resources,  especially consultant and patient's time,  investigate into faulty systems especially those sent on the nhs portal. This misleading scenarios probably happens to many other patients as well so please , I don't want to whinge but this is the least the center and management should look into to use resources rightfully or else missed appointments will pile up because of a faulty notifying patient system which is the only thing that can improve if staffing, and patient numbers can't be controlled any other way.

No one was worried about it until recently it increased in size so that if it snagged on something it could burst. I was referred to the Lawson Clinic for minor surgery.  \r\nAs soon as I entered the care treatment room, a friendly GP introduced herself and we discussed how she intended to proceed and how the surgery would be completed.
