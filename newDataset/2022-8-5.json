He has been having ongoing stomach problems pre admission and a telephone review appointment scheduled with a doctor in July. My father is profoundly deaf in one ear and uses a hearing aid in the other. Since his fall and head injury, his hearing has gotten worse and the hearing aid isn't working as it should. My father is covid positive and I did take the hearing aid to audiology for repair, but it needs to be checked at a time when my father is present to make sure the settings are appropriate. Due to all of this and 3 separate episodes of sickness whilst on the ward, I requested that instead of a telephone consultation, a face to face appointment be facilitated. I asked the nursing staff on the ward, the hospital social worker and I phoned the gastro department directly. None of the gastro secretaries returned my calls and it was very frustrating to get a voicemail, only to be told not to leave a message as the mail box wouldn't be checked. My father has been discharged to a rehab facility with no gastro review. He will have to take a telephone consultation on his own with no family support, and extreme difficulty with his hearing. Given that the message for the future of health care seems to be heavily focused on an integrated approach to care and the trust have a no more silos policy in place, I was extremely disappointed that there couldn't be a collaborative, multi disciplinary approach given to my fathers care. I want to offer my thanks to the nurses on C3 for their patience and compassion in taking time to update me on my fathers care when ever I called. They are extremely professional, caring staff and have a lot to deal with due to covid pressures. I asked for a call from my fathers consultant for an update on his condition, but they never took the time to follow up. I understand they are extremely busy, but given we had no contact with my father due to his covid status, on admission he couldn't update us himself and it created more work for the nurses when they had to follow up with the consultant to answer my questions.  \r\nThe lack of communication at consultant level was very frustrating. Given the circumstances I would have thought a caring organisation would have been more emphatic to the situation, instead of taking the view that a telephone consult was scheduled and there could be no flexibility around it.  \r\n**Video of story in BSL **  \r\nThis is a translation by a BSL translator  \r\n[https://vimeo.com/835695849](https://vimeo.com/835695849)  \r\n**Video of story in ISL**

The response was to phone back tomorrow due to them not accepting any future appointments.\n\nI then phoned back this morning at 8am (the earliest you can call the surgery) to arrange an on-the-day appointment. AskMyGP was unavailable as it always is. I told the receptionist that I had been told to make this appointment and she, instead, informed me that a doctor would give me a call-back at some point today. I therefore waited at home all day for this call for nothing to happen. I called them back at 5pm to chase the phone call up and was told that I was on the list and could expect a call by the time the surgery closed at 8:30pm. I'm not sure how I could be so far down the list after I was one of the first to phone them this morning and I am sure that more than one doctor works at Sleaford. I continued to wait for this call but it never came.\n\nThis concerns my heart; I would imagine this should be prioritised due to it being a fairly serious issue. I am disgusted by the level of service I have received from Sleaford Medical Group and this is certainly not the first time I have been let down by this centre and am very much looking forward to changing practices.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-08-04T19:59:19","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-08-05T09:35:15","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/963592","id":"963592"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/963592/responses","id":"963592"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/963592/healthservices","id":"963592"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/963592/tags","id":"963592"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/c83023","id":"C83023","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disgusted","id":"disgusted"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/group","id":"group"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/heart","id":"heart"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/informed","id":"informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/palpitations","id":"palpitations"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/prioritised","id":"prioritised"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/972416","id":"972416"}]},{"id":962886,"author":"Matdw53","authorRoleId":8,"authorRole":"a staff member posting for a patient/service user","title":"Nurses incredible","body":"My care has been absolutely amazing so far and I am so happy with the care that I have received in the hospital as it has been absolutely incredible so far.

I found the reassurance Melissa was able to give me was important to my recovery - I would say the help I received was invaluable.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-08-03T11:07:51.3666667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-08-05T10:36:33.507","readBy":[{"name":"Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust","count":3}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/962798","id":"962798"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/962798/responses","id":"962798"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/962798/healthservices","id":"962798"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/962798/tags","id":"962798"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rha20-30405","id":"rha20-30405","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/failure","id":"failure"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/heart%20attack","id":"heart attack"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/heart%20failure","id":"heart failure"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helped","id":"helped"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/invaluable","id":"invaluable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurse","id":"nurse"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/recovery","id":"recovery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/walking","id":"walking"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pleased","id":"pleased"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassuring","id":"reassuring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/regained%20confidence","id":"regained confidence"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lost%20confidence","id":"lost confidence"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/963733","id":"963733"}]},{"id":962810,"author":"leopardee97","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Medical needs always prioritized","body":"My overall experience with Rapid Response has been positive.

Remember, this is not a complaint, this is a review, you've had your chance to put things right but you've chosen not to take that opportunity, so please don't publicly patronize me with hollow apologies. Thankyou in advance.\n\nOriginally I was signposted to this service by my gp for cfs/me symptoms.\n\nIt took 3 assessments and the best part of a year just to get 6 sessions of cbt for anxiety.  At my third assessment, after an hour of telling my health story for the third time, the assessor said \"so how can we help you?\".  3 hours spread over 3 sessions over a year and some clown says \"So how can we help you?\".  By definition, that is not an assessment or triage, that's just lazy.\n\nI honestly don't understand why I was signposted to this service for cfs/me.  I did express this to 2 people at the Well-being service but they refused to say that my GP was wrong in his signposting.\n\nAs a result, the 6 cbt sessions I received had nothing to do with my health issues, these sessions made my condition considerably worse.\n\nA year later I was diagnosed with asc by the NeuroBehavioural service, and they also signposted me to the Well-being service.  In the meantime I had been locked in an e-mail battle (17 multi-paragraph e-mails spread over a year is a battle) with the well-being service and had 2 more assessments from them.\n\nI was offered more cbt, which I grabbed with both hands, by this point I had lost my job and was beyond desperate.\n\nThis time I recieved about 26 sessions.  Again, they felt like they had nothing to do with my health issues.  They even tried to convince me that my \"I've always felt different to other people\" statement is a 'core negative belief' or somesuch, in other words, wrong.  Imagine saying that to someone who has struggled all their life with differences and has just been diagnosed with autism, and has become physically ill because of their autism.\n\nThe same therapist also made me draw a life timeline.  I did explain that I didn't need to do this, that I'd already done this, but they insisted.  This exercise upset me considerably for several months, the Therapist did nothing with my timeline, they said it was for my benefit!\n\nAfter my sessions, I spoke to the clinical lead, and they told me that I was wrong, that the therapy I received had not made me worse but had in fact improved my health therefore they will not be offering me further sessions to undo the harm caused.  Nothing could be further from the truth.\n\nIt seems inappropriate to me that gp’s and specialists are signposting patients with complex health issues to the wellbeing service.  The wellbeing service by their own admission are not trained to deal with complex health issues.\n","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-08-02T06:34:06","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2022-08-05T12:12:02","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/963648","id":"963648"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/963648/responses","id":"963648"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/963648/healthservices","id":"963648"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/963648/tags","id":"963648"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/nwx08","id":"NWX08","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20upset","id":"very upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/autism","id":"autism"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cbt","id":"cbt"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/desperate","id":"desperate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/exercise","id":"exercise"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ill","id":"ill"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/triage","id":"triage"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wellbeing","id":"wellbeing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doing%20well","id":"doing well"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/worse%20than%20before","id":"worse than before"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lost","id":"lost"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/like%20myself","id":"like myself"}]},{"id":963649,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Ist time attendance- fantastic experience","body":"How refreshing!
