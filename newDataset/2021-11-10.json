When in Monklands we could change the visitor each day meaning more family could visit which helped our relative for stimulation and also supported the family as there was no pressure for same person to visit every day. Since the move the manager has said it's back to one designated visitor who can visit each day but can't change who the visitor is.  \r\nThis does not appear to be in line with government or NHS Lanarkshire's policy as it says the visitor doesn't need to be the same every day. This has left our relative distressed as they can't see family. Staff nurses are understanding but are told they are acting on managers instructions. We can't get explanation why Wester Moffat is not following NHS Lanarkshire's own policy. Whilst we completely understand we need to keep each other safe whilst Covid goes on, it's unfair this hospital doesn't appear to follow guidance.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-11-08T17:18:07.6466667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-11-10T10:22:51.267","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lanarkshire","count":8},{"name":"Partnership for Change","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/894111","id":"894111"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/894111/responses","id":"894111"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/894111/healthservices","id":"894111"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/894111/tags","id":"894111"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l105h","id":"L105H","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sl9","id":"SL9","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frustrated","id":"frustrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dementia","id":"dementia"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/inconsistent%20policy","id":"inconsistent policy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hospital%20visits","id":"hospital visits"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/896379","id":"896379"}]},{"id":894690,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Amazing experience!","body":"Had a joint assessment today with a really lovely lady, she made me feel really at ease and was very nice.

I was referred to the district nurse to remove said staples on my return home and during this procedure my stomach had failed to heal and my wound opened up. The nurse in question who was in attendance remained calm, rational and very professional by giving me assurance and support whilst telephoning for medical assistance. She remained with me until the paramedics arrived and when in hospital it was deemed the wound could not be closed and was dressed accordingly by the hospital staff with a referral to the district nurse team to continue daily dressings.  \r\nThis was a positive experience due to the fact that the care and attention I received during this time was second to none. Not only did I receive physical support, there were moments when the staff were attentive in respect of helping me emotionally through this difficult time. I feel my recovery was aided with this invaluable support from the team which included Roz, Siohban and Adam who all treated me with respect, dignity and care which is a testament to their given role. Their attitudes were positive in respect of attuning into my feelings on any particular day, they promoted my well-being and continually reassured me that my recovery will be complete.  \r\nThere were days when my mood was low and this was addressed by the staff with their attentiveness and encouragement which was over and above their given role. Roz in particular displayed her true professionalism and referred me to the Tissue Viability team who in turn assessed my wound and administered Pico pump dressings weekly which enhanced my recovery which enabled me to receive Chemotherapy as the open wound would have compromised the treatment.  \r\nHaving never been ill prior to my diagnosis, I found not only did I find myself with a serious life threatening condition, I also contracted Covid which added to my distress, However my care continued with the support of the district nurse team and due to their continued efforts, care and commitment I responded well and through time my wound healed and I continued to recover. Today I am doing well and feel I have to have my say in respect of voicing my story. I have nothing but respect for all the NHS staff who were involved in my recovery, particularly given the circumstances in these difficult days and added pressure on our valuable resources. A big thank you especially to the Kilwinning district nurse team.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-11-08T21:55:33.2633333","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2021-11-10T11:13:22.96","readBy":[{"name":"North Ayrshire Health & Social Care Partnership","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/894168","id":"894168"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/894168/responses","id":"894168"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/894168/healthservices","id":"894168"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/894168/tags","id":"894168"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/nahscp-community-nursing-service","id":"nahscp-community-nursing-service","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/attentive%20staff","id":"Attentive Staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bowel%20cancer","id":"bowel cancer"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/chemotherapy","id":"chemotherapy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/district%20nurse","id":"district nurse"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emotional%20support","id":"emotional support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/excellent%20care","id":"excellent care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/low%20mood","id":"Low mood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professional","id":"professional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/respected","id":"respected"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/calm","id":"calm"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dignity","id":"Dignity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid-19","id":"covid-19"}]},{"id":894703,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"A6 Excellence","body":"Broke my hip in a fall and the kind attentive professionals in A6 were brilliant.

I have absolutely no complaints about my care, my concerns are about the overworked staff who are clearly totally exhausted and deflated. I have previously worked at the decline in recent years. Entry to the ward showed corridors full of equipment, laundry etc, is there not a store room? One nurse was on their knees exhausted after a 12 hour shift with no breaks, hardly any drinks with the thoughts of leaving the profession. A shocking waste of nurses time was spent looking for the red folders and equipment. Can the stats machine not be made computerised to avoid this? I had to be on oxygen for a while but there was only one portable cylinder for the whole of the ward which would have to go to other patients needing to go for tests or even the toilet! More often than not it was taken off my bed. At one point I was given the emergency oxygen cylinder because there was really nothing else. The nebuliser was also taken from me as there was not enough. There wasn’t enough water jugs to go round, most of the time it was a disposable plastic cup on our tables with water in it, easily knocked over and not environmentally friendly. Can the volunteers not come back? This would relieve a little pressure on the staff with regards to the tea rounds. The pharmacy I was told, is not open at the weekend, this could mean that, yet again, the nurses suffer by having to get together medication sometimes having to go to other wards to get this. Surely Dr Grays is big enough to have the pharmacy open 7 days? I feel so sorry for the loyal hard working, underpaid staff who are trying to keep it together but unless the management get an urgent plan of action with immediate affect I fear we will lose more of these fantastic workers.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-11-09T11:16:08.7133333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-11-10T11:17:40.26","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Grampian","count":7}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/894294","id":"894294"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/894294/responses","id":"894294"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/894294/healthservices","id":"894294"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/894294/tags","id":"894294"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/n411h-chest-medicine","id":"n411h-chest-medicine","score":4},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/concerned","id":"concerned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/time%20wasted","id":"time wasted"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/overworked%20staff","id":"overworked staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lack%20of%20resources","id":"lack of resources"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cluttered","id":"cluttered"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pharmacy%20opening%20times","id":"pharmacy opening times"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/896555","id":"896555"}]},{"id":894704,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Prompt return call","body":"got through to a receptionist after waiting for 30 mins - but she was kind, supportive and arranged for a GP to call me.

I was given daily physio to aid my legs one which had a rod and the other an external fixator as well as pins and plates in both arms.

It usually seems like people are always moody and don’t want to help…  \r\nSo that’s why I have to speak so positively when I come across people so helpful and kind and caring. After moving back from Glasgow to London I was struggling to find a GP to register at. I have a lung disease which requires medication. The Lawson practice was the last practice I was willing to try and register myself and 3 children at after trying a total of 7 gp surgeries it seemed the Lawson practice were the only people in my catchment area. I was already feeling a bit low but I knew I had to get help for my breathing.  \r\nThe first receptionist I handed my documents across the desk to couldn’t have been nicer. I later found out this young woman was named Asia. I have extreme social anxiety which makes it hard for me to do simple tasks which others might find easy such as registration for example. Even though it’s for my own health. I still cannot seem to bring myself to do it. Asia registered me with ease and every appointment since she has gone above and beyond to try and help me as best as she can, if she can’t she certainly finds someone who will but she’s usually the woman for the job.  \r\nThen there’s my lovely GP Dr Ali. Wow what a woman. I refuse to see anyone else because as I said I am extremely anxious and I prefer continuing care with the same professionals. Dr Ali has also gone above and beyond and her contributions to the GP practice should not be overlooked. She is a remarkable doctor. I always feel like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders when I see Dr Ali.  \r\nBoth women are amazing and they have definitely made me have a much more positive experience with your practice. I hope this message is passed on to both women as they truly do make the world a nicer place and continue to do so.  \r\nThank you ladies for your support. I truly do appreciate it.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-11-09T11:29:15.2566667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-11-10T12:34:57.52","readBy":[{"name":"The Lawson Practice","count":2},{"name":"City & Hackney GP Confederation","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/894295","id":"894295"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/894295/responses","id":"894295"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/894295/healthservices","id":"894295"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/894295/tags","id":"894295"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/f84096","id":"F84096","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/above%20and%20beyond","id":"above and beyond"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appointments","id":"appointments"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/caring","id":"caring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gp","id":"GP"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kind","id":"kind"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/receptionist","id":"receptionist"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/registration","id":"registration"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/894726","id":"894726"}]},{"id":894248,"author":"Sangje","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Sensitivity, skill and kindness.","body":"I am 7 days after a hysterectomy in Edinburgh Royal Infirmary (ward 210) and I wanted to thank all the teams involved from the admin support staff who put up with so much (e.g. my anxious phone calls) under pressure , the surgical and anesthetic teams and of course the wonderful ward staff.  \r\nFrom the start of my 'journey' everyone has been marvellous - the surgical team and anesthetists listened carefully to my special circumstances and complexities and were 'human' , attentive and approachable which made a huge difference .  \r\nThe ward staff were without exception kind and compassionate and nothing was too much trouble despite them obviously being very busy.

It’s such a shame that the nurses have to stay in the office doing paperwork for entire shifts. Purposeful engagement should be offered daily, but we don’t even know who our named nurses are. It feels like there are too many patients for the amount of allocated nurses, it would be nice to see nurses able to spend time interacting with patients and therefore improving patient recovery time by getting to know the individual they are then discussing in MDT’s, professional meetings, ward rounds and hand overs. There is a lot of agency HCA’s which makes it difficult to develop any trust as the regular nurses are rarely free for conversation. \nThere is sometimes a glimpse of the ward manager, who seems to be able to be involved in decisions about people she’s never had a conversation with. It would certainly improve the ward if the management were more visible and able to help out when the ward is short staffed or struggling due to incidents etc. \nI struggle to believe that people became nurses to then just sit behind a desk and not interact with patients unless it’s extremely brief. \nThis is not meant as a negative review as I do believe the regular staff are trying their hardest. I just think that maybe SABP should rethink job roles and work out ways to engage more frequently with patients. Look at what worked at other hospitals and learn from each other. It would be good for the senior matron to make herself more visible and give opportunities to meet with patients about what does and doesn’t work.

Everyone from the cleaners to the consultants were excellent.  \r\nUnfortunately there was only one nurse that spoiled my stay in Ward 10. I happened to need help back into bed, had been using the support of a crepe bandage to help lifting operated leg into bed as advised. Somehow it slipped and I screamed out in agony and a nurse came to my aid, but was told by said nurse I would have to learn to do myself as it was a new knee and had to try, which I had been doing up until the bandage slip. I was very upset and tried to explain the reason for my upset was that I had experienced dislocations in knee since I was 12yrs old. The agony of this is hard to explain unless you have experienced it, so instead of helping me and then explaining how the knee had to be built up I got spoken to like a child, with no compassion.  \r\nI was left in tears. I am not usually someone that would accept someone speaking to me like that. But when you are recovering from what everyone says is a major operation, you are not in the frame of mind to deal with someone like that.

Again I was called through very quickly by a junior doctor who made an assessment of the cuts on my face and secured a room within about 15 mins. The doctor was really lovely to be treated by - she was engaging and informative, and worked through the paperwork quickly and with her full attention. I was subsequently treated by her and a nurse who both did a fabulous job, not just of stitching the wounds, but also chatting with me to take my mind off the difficult moments. I was given all the information I needed and fixed up a follow-up appointment with the same doctor to remove the stitches a week later. \nThankfully I rarely need the facilities of the Princess Royal Hospital, however I wanted to record that my recent experience was of a friendly, efficient and professional team working well together - which I know can be extremely difficult to achieve. \nIn particular I thought the care and attention given me by the Maxillofacial doctor was excellent which belies the image people have of large, 'faceless' organisations.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2021-11-10T16:25:40","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-11-10T16:28:23","readBy":[{"name":"Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/894784","id":"894784"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/894784/responses","id":"894784"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/894784/healthservices","id":"894784"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/894784/tags","id":"894784"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rxwat","id":"RXWAT","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/broken","id":"broken"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/excellent","id":"excellent"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/face","id":"face"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hand","id":"hand"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stitches","id":"stitches"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stitching","id":"stitching"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/x-ray","id":"X-ray"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/900443","id":"900443"}]},{"id":894783,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Fantastic practice","body":"My husband had a TIA on Sunday evening and after serious problems with both 111 and our surgery on Monday morning I brought my husband into A&E where he was told, after being seen by a GP, that he would be referred to the stroke clinic.

Very long waiting time on the phone; virtually impossible to see someone face to face; an impersonal disinterested impression is given overall. I feel sorry for those doctors who work hard and have their patients’ interests at heart. They are battling against failed management and an unwieldy over-large practice resulting from the merger of three surgeries. There is no consistency in the doctor you consult. Often they are new to you and completely ignorant of your medical history. I waited for a telephone appointment in order to consult a doctor I used to see, and tests were set up. Unfortunately the ´feed-back’ came in the form of a brief letter from another GP informing  me that the results were not satisfactory and that my medication had been changed. There was no more detail though I was invited to telephone if I was concerned. This was from the same person who shortly before had written to say that I might benefit from statins. Had they read my notes or even my prescriptions they might have noticed that I have been taking statins for more than 15 years. Non of this is reassuring.
