Whilst the nurse and consultant were absolutely great, doing their level best to make it as quick and painless as possible, the after care was severely lacking.  \r\nAs I attempted to leave the building I was in such excruciating pain I was disorientated and I could barely walk. I had to lean on my husband at the main entrance door to stop me passing out. On the way home in the car I wanted to be sick and almost passed out again. When I got home I was crawling to the bathroom because I couldn't stand.  \r\nWith no after care leaflet or any kind of information about what to expect other than bleeding, I tried to contact the outpatient department for advice but no one was available. I had no choice but to phone NHS 24. Finally at 8pm, I spoke to an excellent doctor who thought that my symptoms might be related to some other underlying pelvic issue because of the severity.  \r\nMy complaint is that without aftercare advice and not knowing who to contact if unsure, your pain and anxiety worsens. I got more aftercare after all my Covid vaccinations! Perhaps it would be a good idea to have a post-procedure seating area just in case patients do react badly.  \r\nThank goodness someone was with me to drive. I was in no fit state. And no one even asked me how I was getting home either. As I said, the consultant and nurse were excellent but post-procedure needs more thought and attention.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-05-23T12:51:47.0733333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-05-25T08:08:18.783","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lanarkshire","count":6}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/941359","id":"941359"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/941359/responses","id":"941359"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/941359/healthservices","id":"941359"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/941359/tags","id":"941359"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l308h_502","id":"L308H_502","score":3},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/information","id":"information"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/polyp","id":"polyp"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/recovery%20area","id":"recovery area"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/aftercare%20advice","id":"aftercare advice"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/943576","id":"943576"}]},{"id":941360,"author":"UBfamily","authorRoleId":4,"authorRole":"a relative","title":"Sensitive and gentle nursing from ward 17 team","body":"Yesterday my 89 year-old mother passed away in ward 17 of Monklands University Hospital.

My mum was was thoroughly investigated and an underlying problem identified which required surgical intervention in Craigavon Hospital. The senior doctor in the department took time to speak to me and explain the plan he was putting in place. I left the department feeling my mum was safe and the care was excellent.  \r\nMum was transferred to Craigavon Hospital, Ward 4 South where she was treated with dignity, respect and compassion. She was spoken to clearly, reassured and at all times was so well cared for. Thank you Sister Ashlene, and thank you to all the Nursing, Medical and Support staff who took time to chat to my mum, explain in terms that she could understand what was happening and who kept me engaged and involved in her care. I was so delighted to received regular updates from the ward by telephone without prompt. I cannot thank you enough. You collectively made a very distressing situation so much easier to navigate through. Thank you for facilitating my hospital visits and allowing me to support my mum with her evening meal.  \r\nI just wanted to say that it was a pleasure to hear gentle laughter on the ward and witness a strong team ethos. The friendly ward atmosphere created such a lovely ward environment for patients and staff alike. You all should be really proud.  \r\nAt the change of shift two members of the team called out \"bye bye\" to my mum as they were leaving the ward. They called her by her first name and I asked my mum who they were. She said they are my friends, and are such lovely girls. Mum was so happy during her stay despite being in a strange environment.  \r\nI felt my mum was safe in 4 South and that she was receiving the best care possible. The Team knew her dementia diagnosis and used this in a positive way to ensure she was as engaged as she could be in her care. The medical and nursing staff took time to listen to my concerns and walk me through the plan for mums care. My mums care was person centered. Her likes and dislikes were considered. The ward was busy and yet at no stage did I feel communication or care was rushed. Everyone was just so pleasant and caring. Mum and I had such a good experience.

Thank you so much for making what could have been a very stressful visit for them much easier.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-05-23T21:29:52.6066667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-05-25T10:27:01.587","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lanarkshire","count":5},{"name":"Partnership for Change","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/941510","id":"941510"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/941510/responses","id":"941510"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/941510/healthservices","id":"941510"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/941510/tags","id":"941510"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l308h_180","id":"L308H_180","score":5},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l308h-radiology","id":"L308H-Radiology","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/accident%20&%20emergency","id":"accident & emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ankle","id":"ankle"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ankle%20injury","id":"ankle injury"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/autistic","id":"autistic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helpful","id":"helpful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kindness","id":"kindness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medical%20staff","id":"medical staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nursing%20staff","id":"nursing staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/prompt%20service","id":"prompt service"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/radiology","id":"radiology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/receptionist","id":"receptionist"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/short%20wait","id":"short wait"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/understanding","id":"understanding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing","id":"amazing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20for","id":"cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassion","id":"compassion"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happy","id":"happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/relieved","id":"relieved"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/radiology%20team","id":"radiology team"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/injuries","id":"injuries"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/942047","id":"942047"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/942049","id":"942049"}]},{"id":941509,"author":"FGH38","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Unsatisfactory language used in appointment letters","body":"I echo several other stories here in saying how unsatisfactory the language used is in appointment letters.  \r\nI attended the Dermatology department for what I thought was a review with my doctor, and instead found was an appointment for routine bloods which I could have arranged at my GP at a time convenient to me.  \r\nMy appointment was titled, BAU Contingency Treatment Diary SCH, which means nothing to me.  \r\nBetween receiving this appointment letter and attending the appointment, I received a separate letter requesting I arrange blood tests either with my GP or by phoning the department.  \r\nThis is unnecessarily confusing and unhelpful.

My father had blood tests, chest X-ray, and medications given and surgeons informed. He was seen by the SHO who was very kind and asked for her registrar to review. Her registrar and the consultant saw my father very quickly and requested a CT scan which they arranged for the same afternoon. Although it was a long day - we arrived around 0945 and left just before 5 pm - my father was seen, investigated, had a diagnosis and a plan for follow up. As an NHS worker myself, I was really proud of how well organised the system was. I also know that staff work hard and do their best, but being on the patient side for once I really appreciated how it really is the little things - kind words, patience and a smile - which make such a difference. Would love to name the ENT junior doctors - they were delightful and a credit to the future of the NHS - but also the A&E nurses, receptionists, the lovely porter who found a blanket for my dad before wheeling him round the hospital, the security guard….thank you all.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-05-24T21:46:23","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-05-25T10:59:06","readBy":[{"name":"Chelsea and Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/942056","id":"942056"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/942056/responses","id":"942056"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/942056/healthservices","id":"942056"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/942056/tags","id":"942056"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rqm91","id":"RQM91","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood","id":"blood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20tests","id":"blood tests"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/chest","id":"chest"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ct","id":"ct"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ct%20scan","id":"CT scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/delightful","id":"delightful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diagnosis","id":"diagnosis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/elderly","id":"elderly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ent","id":"ent"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/informed","id":"informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/proud","id":"proud"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scan","id":"scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tests","id":"tests"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/x-ray","id":"X-ray"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appreciated","id":"appreciated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doing%20well","id":"doing well"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1034047","id":"1034047"}]},{"id":942059,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Friendly practice ","body":"Just want too say a big thankyou too the receptionist too the doctors ... i have always found these doctors are trustworthy and caring towards me with my problems lately...\n\nLike the new phone system you know where u are in queue... \n\nThankyou everyone for doing the most difficult job ...

Or so I thought.  \r\nMy story began over 3 years ago now, I've always been a social drinker from about age 15, just normal, a few drinks weekends, maybe more. Then over the last 3 years it crept up and up, without me really realising. Then it became a big problem, I couldn't function without drinking. I left my job, my relationships with family and friends declined. My main concern was alcohol, where and when I could get it. How did this happen to me. I could see no way out, I was in this dark place, on a conveyor belt, with no way off.  \r\nI engaged with One Recovery Bucks through my doctor, I had a couple of keyworkers, but to be honest I wasn't engaging, I tried, but felt so awful, I kept drinking. Covid came, so no visits to centre. I had my new keyworker Manjinder, she could have given up on me, but she didn't. She kept pushing me and guiding me, making me realise, I could actually beat this somehow. Sadly my marriage was falling apart, my husband didn't understand alcoholism, he just thought it was my choice. (If only it was that easy). He took all the handles of every window, locked and padlocked doors and gates, so I could not leave home. I became like a rat, looking for alcohol. My despair was getting worse. I tried to take my life, there was no where I felt I belonged. I broke my kneecap trying to escape the home. I fell over and broke my arm, all due to alcohol. So so ashamed. Manjinder, still there supporting me, guiding me, believing in me. Eventually I engaged. My children always there, watching, waiting, caring, but helpless to what was happening to their Mother.  \r\nI went away to a rehab called Betel in Derby. It's free, but you have to work 6 days a week within the charity to keep funds coming in to feed and clothe us all. We also all learnt a new trade to help us when moved on. I lived in a safe house with 11 girls and at the farm where we worked there was about 50 men. I learnt so much about myself, giving me inner strength (I call it my toolbox to deal with issues and thoughts). I received a letter, after 27 years of marriage, from my husband. He wanted a divorce. I was destroyed, I was sobre, trying to get better for myself and my family. The time at Betel to reflect to see the real me again, made me realise I could do this.  \r\nI left rehab, and drank again, I was so destroyed about my marriage and then I found out about his affair. I didn't blame him, because I felt so worthless. I had let my family down completely. But who was there to support me, Manjinder, fighting me to gain control, you've got this, she would say. I ended up homeless, because my daughter was under 16, social services was involved, I had an altercation with my husband and I was arrested. No longer allowed in the family home we owned.  \r\nOur wonderful government system kicked in. I was hospitalised for 3 weeks, I got a bug in my blood stream. Really could anything more happen? Outreach got involved with my care, as they found me homeless, connections then took over to support me finding a place to live. Manjinder still there, telling me, you've got this. Where would I be without these ladies in my life supporting me. I couldn't have done this alone. But equally, I couldn't have done it if I hadn't engaged with One Recovery to begin with and started to believe that I could beat this awful disease.  \r\nToday Manjinder released me from her care. She feels it's time, another step forward, so now the recovery team will take over, and Connections still supporting me with housing and getting back to work. I'm currently volunteering. Every day, is a new day, which I look at with new eyes. I get overwhelmed very easily, so out comes my inner toolbox. Its a very lonely journey being an alcoholic, but even more lonely when you are sober with a clear head, but I feel so healthy and happy. Sadly in our society its normal to drink. I cannot ever risk having a drink again. I am adjusting my life, with new friends and watching the company I keep.  \r\nI cannot begin to thank so many people for caring, believing, listening, understanding, never judging me. Ambulance staff, nurses, doctors, social workers, ORB, Connections, Betel, family and friends.  \r\nI don't know how it all began, but its been a hard journey, I have learnt so much about myself and others. So it starts with being Openminded and engaging I suppose. One day at a time.  \r\nI now can look forward to my future, to the person I am becoming. I want to help others who have been in this type of situation. We never now what's round the corner.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-05-24T09:04:28.7733333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-05-25T11:22:02.05","readBy":[{"name":"Midlands Partnership NHS Foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/941669","id":"941669"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/941669/responses","id":"941669"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/941669/healthservices","id":"941669"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/941669/tags","id":"941669"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rrex4-buckinghamshire-stars","id":"RREX4-buckinghamshire-stars","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/alcohol","id":"alcohol"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/broken%20arm","id":"broken arm"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/caring","id":"caring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/consistency","id":"consistency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/coping%20strategies","id":"Coping strategies"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctors","id":"doctors"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/healthy","id":"healthy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/learning","id":"learning"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lonely","id":"lonely"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/social%20workers","id":"social workers"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/understanding","id":"understanding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happy","id":"happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported","id":"supported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wonderful","id":"wonderful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ambulance%20staff","id":"ambulance staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/believed%20in%20me","id":"believed in me"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20judged","id":"not judged"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%2019","id":"covid 19"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/942468","id":"942468"}]},{"id":942070,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Fantastic staff - couldn’t fault any of them ","body":"Every single member of staff I came across as an Admission on the day patient at the gynaecology unit was so lovely, kind and professional - they couldn’t have been nicer and put me more at ease.

It never feels like they actually want to help, they just want you off the phone. My partner is pregnant but that information doesn't seem to install any urgency in the attempt to find an appointment. Phone waiting times are often 45 minutes or more - after which you get put through to an extremely unhelpful person who doesn't listen and wants you off the phone. I understand that the pandemic put an enormous strain on the NHS but surely by now - May 2022 - it should be possible to get a physical appointment rather than being forced to fill out an e-consult form which often confuses and fails to work.\nOnce you actually get through to a medical professional they are all excellent so this negative review relates entirely to the reception staff and the operating systems.

Painful thighs when I lie on my side, left and right, in bed at night. This had been ongoing for some months and I was now needing to find out what it was. My husband told me to tell them about my weight loss too. Bloods were taken a few days later and I handed in a poo sample.  \r\nWhen the results came back the bloods were normal, however, the poo sample had blood traces. The Nurse Practitioner informed me that he would refer me to the local hospital for further investigation, due to my unexplained weight loss. Also, I may not be contacted straight away as the hospitals are very busy.  \r\nImagine my surprise, when the next day I received a phone call from the ECDC (Early Cancer Diagnosis Centre). Lifestyle questions were answered and I was informed about the next step with the ECDC. I received appointment details for a CT scan toward the end of January, at Queen Margaret, Dunfermline and a Results appointment at the beginning of February, at Victoria Hospital, Kirkcaldy.  \r\nIt was like a whirlwind, not of destruction/confusion, but reassurance and comfort. Everything happened quickly, in a very organised way, giving me confidence that the people who would be caring for me knew what they were doing and would be there of me.  \r\nMore bloods were taken and the CT scan was done. I was contacted the following day by Katie - ECDC nurse - who informed me that the only issue they had was in my lungs. They were passing me over to Chest Department for clarification.  \r\nSo, in early February I had my appointment with Katie who checked my legs over and informed me she would try and arrange an Ultra Sound to ascertain the problem. My appointment with the Chest department was also that same day, in the afternoon. Mr McKenzie reviewed the CT scan sharing the details with me, not only of the recent scan but the first one I had taken. This showed an improvement in the overall condition of my lungs but highlighted the need for further investigation of an ongoing health problem I have with my lungs.  \r\nAmazingly, in less than four weeks I had been assessed for cancer and was clear.

We were informed at every stage and as the team come to the family home we never feel we are being a bother to them whereas in a busy ward it's maybe not always possible to speak to the Dr. With hospital at home our experience has been very satisfactory and our preferred approach for both out elderly parents.
