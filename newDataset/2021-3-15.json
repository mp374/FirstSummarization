There are on average 12 cases of anal cancer per year in Leicester and that 90% were treated with a successful outcome. Unable to have chemo therapy a course of radiotherapy began in June 2020, numerous cancellations and delays of consultations, assessments and apointments meant that the cancer caused rapid deterioration of the health of my partner, he was unable to walk more than a few steps without excruciating pain, lie on his back or front or sit at all.  \r\nOn hospital visits (including one that was cancelled by phone that morning when he was upstairs and couldn’t reach the landline and had no mobile and I was at hospital myself from 7.30am until 12 resulting in us attending at great cost to stress and physical health) we were told there was no possibility of having a trolley to take him to wards, consults, appointments resulting in more injury and strain on his anal, rectum areas where his cancer was progressing. After refusing him an operation at The Spires,(more travelling, visits and assessments, more deterioration in health, the consultant decided to operate himself as an emergency at the Royal in Leicester. The operation, including restorative plastic surgery, took place in December 2020. They removed his anus, rectum, ulcer and tumour and surgically placed a Stoma bag  \r\n8th-14th in hospital, had to return to see consultant weekly more travel more walking, still no trolley to the Jarvis or other wards, still the receptionists and others saying a trolley was not possible, in one case saying it could take upto an hour when the appointment was in 10 minutes. I pointed out red spot where there had been none the week before to the consultant and that the wound, from start of buttocks to back of scrotum was still discharging faecal matter, was told not to worry by nurse unless it turned green. A dressing was placed by the nurse occasionally. This never lasted more than a day.  \r\nA biopsy was booked, more travelling, walking to assessment, operation, to hear result. We were told nothing more could bedone and my partner was discharged to the GP for palliative care. we were told by the consultant that a doctor would attend and a nurse would come every day. He was to continue with morphine and the pain management team would possibly be able to control the pain so he might be able to sit eventually. No timeline was given, though it was suggested upto 5 years might be possible if the cancer did not spread further, but it had recurred. The nurse said the consultant might be out of touch with home provision now Covid altered everything.  \r\n. The Stoma nurses had been in contact and shown my partner how to replace his Stoma bag, not shown me, even though he was on morphine patches and was to increase dosage of oral morphine. I am bi polar, controlled by medication, have arthritis and foot problems. We are both 71.  \r\nFeb23/21 he was referred back to GP, with bigger and more widespread unhealed wound. All his follow up consultations with the plastic surgeon were cancelled because of Covid, and when we were offered an appointment he was too ill to travel and had been referred back to Gp. A district nurse attended, due Monday. 4pm (I can’t remember if it was then or Wednesday) she had been told to dress a wound, no more information, the dressing wasn’t big enough to cover the whole wound and the discharge had increased. My partner complained that the pain was unbearable and asked me to take off the plaster dressing the next day, it was soiled and dripping. Another district nurse came on Sunday afternoon the 7th asked if he wanted a dressing, when he said no because it hurt too much she took a photo of the top of the wound and said she would come round next Friday as he could only get daily visits for wound dressing.  \r\nMeantime we had a phone call from Macmillan's to tell us that the person responsible for assessing referrals was unavailable so no one could deal with us now, but we could expect a call from them on Monday 1st March. The call came and we were asked about his pain relief and told to note down the amount and time of his oral morphine medication so she had a better idea of dosage. We were both annoyed that other questions we had were not heard, it seemed to be a closed phone call. My partner only having gone out to hospital since November 2019 in pain, being deaf in one ear and having the other filling up with wax and his eyesight needing another eye test and glasses as he could no longer see the TV was told he must try to find people to come out to see him himself. We both wanted a Macmillan nurse to inspect and advise on his difficulties.  \r\nThe follow up call on Thursday never happened, or at least no message was left on the machine. We had a hospital bed arrive on Tuesday 9th March that we couldn’t adjust ourselves, but wait until the district nurse came next to adjust. The air mattress was too hard for my partner who was developing pressure sores on hips, elbows and knees from being on his side for the past year and more, he had to suffer some more. That Tuesday his Stoma Bag burst in bed, he is a very private person and did his bag himself and I cleaned the mess everywhere else. Wednesday and Thursday he had fallen from the bed twice as he leaned forward to ease the pressure, was clammy on his forehead and when he was sick I got the doctor to call, who sent him straight to AandE. he has been kept in, with no visitors, after we had hoped to enjoy every moment left of being together.  \r\nBecause of the stress and the experience of waiting constantly for the next appointment/treatment over the last 20 months I am pleased that my daughter and sister who live in Leicester have been supporting me by providing transport to the hospital for my partner and to my own appointments. My foot problems make life difficult. I can’t get up without assistance myself when I kneel, and find it difficult to bend to pick up dropped items, or to clean the floor properly, or to climb stairs, often 12 or more times a day checking on my partner, going to the bathroom with him,  \r\ntaking him medication and food. Plus I am exhausted every day just cooking, cleaning and shifting furniture, we have a 3story house with steps front and back. I haven’t been able to get a doctors appointment for myself often and when I do it’s 1 patient I problem (and I Have Many)  \r\nI appreciate that the NHS and Charities have suffered greatly in the last decade or more by the evil and inhumane funding cuts by the government, as well as Covid being mismanaged by the inept and incompetent, wasting billions mainly on cronyism and business interests. The dismantling of the NHS and Education systematically has caused lots of (perhaps) unintended consequences, but the price being paid in blood and suffering cannot be compensated for by the incredible service being shown by our overworked underpaid or not paid in the face of such calamity. It is unfair. Everyone I have met in the health service has impressed by their dedication, kindness, empathy (except for their ignorance about anal cancer) and care. The break down between services seems again deliberate government policy.  \r\nAnyway I am back waiting, in seclusion, with limited IT skills and no mobile, a State pensioner, there are many more just like me, waiting sometimes with no hope of relief or any hope. Thanks to the work Macmillans try to do it is bearable.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-03-12T13:07:21.1533333","progress":"Story has a

To say it was a pleasure to meet such dedicated and professional staff would be an understatement. As soon as they arrived at my Mother's home they immediately set my Mother and our families mind at ease as we could see they were going to do all they could to help her. Within a 24 hour period we were astounded at the amount of care and tests our mother had recieved.. Mummy was first visited by Deputy Sister Aisling, a complete breath of fresh air, just what our Mother needed at that time.. Aisling and her personality were like a tonic in itself. Aisling was joinned by Dr Meg a very gentle. Warm. thorough and commited young Dr. Meg took time to explain all the blood tests etc that Mum was having done. Aisling took time to sit down with the family and explain all that would be happening with Mum and the Acute Care at Home Team going forward. The following day all the team assembled again with Consultant Dr Anne another extremely warm and professional Dr taking time to question Mum thoroughly about her illness.. Offer encouragement. Instill confidence and explain all tests she was going to go through.. The attention Mum recieved was second to none over the next few days the team were assisted by Barry, Emma, Diane, Fiona, Collette.(ECG technician) Anna-Marie,(physio) Louise (Dietitian) and Catherine (Pharmacist) & Dr Mc Caffrey Consultant Geriatrician. Each one exactly like the others truly professional and attentive. The team left absolutely no stone left unturned regarding reaching a diagnosis and treatment of Mum. They constantly kept us updated with any results they had recieved.. Our Mothers progress and recovery we put down 100% to the excellent care she has recieved. We consider the Acute Care at Home Teams approach and delivery of care the Rolls Royce standard. It was a pleasure for our Mother and each of us to deal with all its members everyday. We thank you from the bottom of our hearts for all you have done. We will continue to sing your praises foreverThank you so much","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-03-12T15:23:35.4633333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-03-15T12:09:05.97","readBy":[{"name":"Southern Health and Social Care Trust","count":9}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/831765","id":"831765"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/831765/responses","id":"831765"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/831765/healthservices","id":"831765"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/831765/tags","id":"831765"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003-acute-care-at-home","id":"zt003-acute-care-at-home","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/attention%20to%20detail","id":"attention to detail"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20tests","id":"blood tests"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/determined","id":"determined"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diagnosis","id":"diagnosis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ecg","id":"ecg"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/encouraging","id":"encouraging"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/geriatrician","id":"geriatrician"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/physio","id":"physio"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professionalism","id":"professionalism"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tests","id":"tests"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20for","id":"cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confidence","id":"confidence"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20ease","id":"at ease"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/raised%20spirits","id":"raised spirits"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/832880","id":"832880"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/834231","id":"834231"}]},{"id":831772,"author":"TheoSienna","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Professional but relaxed","body":"I had my first visit recently.

My mum had been battling for a very long time and sadly she passed away. While my mum was battling cancer I was also helping my mum. If she needed a drink, food or help to sit up or changing her dressings. When my mum died part of me died with her, I shut my feelings down buried my emotions. I couldn't bear talking about it. I had support from my family but choose not to tell them not realising that this would come to the surface later.  \r\nI am now 35 and have a family and been divorced for 5-6 years which was a very nasty break up. In that time I started to get anxiety. My chest started to beat really fast. It was so fast as if I was about to be sick and found it hard to relax things would worry me and it would be chasing around in my head. I was starting to have anxiety attacks. It got to a point I was scared to go to work and it affected my work.  \r\nI was put in touch with Inclusion Thurrock from my doctor, I needed help, I was at my lowest and I can honestly say this was the best thing I ever did. The people that phoned me for an assessment was so kind, caring and prepared to wait when you are crying. Then they decided what sort of therapy would be best. There will be 3 group meetings to do first. This was done by google classroom (but in normal times would have been face to face). This is to get you ready for therapy and what to expect. Then you get contacted by your therapist to arrange therapy. I am now on path which I never thought I’d be on now. If you want to change what ever you're going through this is the best place to help you.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-03-12T16:35:00.3","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-03-15T12:24:22.3","readBy":[{"name":"Midlands Partnership NHS Foundation Trust","count":4}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/831776","id":"831776"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/831776/responses","id":"831776"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/831776/healthservices","id":"831776"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/831776/tags","id":"831776"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rrex4-inclusion-thurrock","id":"rrex4-inclusion-thurrock","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/caring","id":"caring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/empathy","id":"empathy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kind","id":"kind"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/832708","id":"832708"}]},{"id":829426,"author":"Crick","authorRoleId":4,"authorRole":"a relative","title":"South Lanarkshire Council Social worker","body":"For the last month I have been trying to get in contact with Social work in East Kilbride regarding my mother moving from North Lanarkshire to South Lanarkshire, To try and get home care services she requires in place for move to new flat.  \r\nI have phoned 6 times in last 2 weeks firstly to be told be by very abrupt person on phone that this would involve 6 weeks money to be paid for transfer of care and nothing could be started until we got North Lanarkshire to request and give details and they ended call.  \r\nThe last few times have called have been transferred to wrong department no less than 4 times never getting to correct department.  \r\nAll during this my mum is sitting in a property which could be unsuitable for her current mobility having to negotiate stairs all this while she a falls risk","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-03-04T08:16:23.7933333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-03-15T12:33:09.853","readBy":[{"name":"Voluntary Action North Lanarkshire","count":1},{"name":"South Lanarkshire Health & Social Care Partnership","count":1},{"name":"Partnership for Change","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/829426","id":"829426"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/829426/responses","id":"829426"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/829426/healthservices","id":"829426"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/829426/tags","id":"829426"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/s37000028","id":"S37000028","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/annoyed","id":"annoyed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mobility","id":"mobility"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/rheumatism","id":"rheumatism"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/847799","id":"847799"}]},{"id":831792,"author":"kilty37","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"I would like to thank all the staff","body":"I went through a separation after 28yrs with my partner after trying to commit suicide. I lost my home, family, job, everything and started drinking more and more, I was in temporary accommodation, and started drinking everyday, first a bottle of wine, then started having 2 a day but not everyday. I eventually got a place of my own, and loved it, but the drinking was still out of hand, didn't drink during week just Friday Saturday and Sunday, I always enjoyed a drink and worked on the pub and nightclub scene for years, I realised that this was getting out of hand and also I didn't realise i was type 2 diabetic, (I was also HIV 27 years). Anyway my doctor told me I need to sort this out at the GU Clinic, and she also mentioned that they had recently done a conference at the local CGL in Notts about drugs and alcohol, etc, so advised me to go there. It took a while to get up enough courage BUT I DID IT, I met a lady call Dot, who talked me through my mental health, my loss and also about my alcohol intake, I started on medication to stop the cravings and had Alan and John ring me very week then every 2 weeks, they helped me loads they seemed to care about me, and it has helped me, I AM CLEAN, there were 2 minor hick-ups, BUT 1 glass of wine and again weeks later, But now I've been clean for 5 months am not on medication, and I seem to be in a better place, I can go into my supermarket and walk down the aisle and come out with NO DRINK YIPEEEE.  \r\nSo I would like to thank ALL the staff at C.G.L Worksop especially, Dot, Alan and John for all their support and kind words, and especially all through the lockdowns since last year. I can say I am clean I am now off their books but have been told that if I need their help I only have to ring them. Thank you all so much.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-03-12T18:24:10.9366667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-03-15T12:35:50.273","readBy":[{"name":"Ulster University, MBBS (Medicine) 2021","count":1},{"name":"Change Grow Live","count":4}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/831792","id":"831792"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/831792/responses","id":"831792"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/831792/healthservices","id":"831792"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/831792/tags","id":"831792"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/nms-cglnotts","id":"nms-cglnotts","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/alcohol","id":"alcohol"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diabetic","id":"diabetic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helped","id":"helped"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hiv","id":"hiv"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kindness","id":"kindness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/suicide","id":"suicide"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/telephone%20contact","id":"telephone contact"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/832720","id":"832720"}]},{"id":831666,"author":"Lyndon13","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"My experience from GP to PPH.","body":"One day at the end of February at 2pm I went to see my GP with breathing problems by 2:30pm I was admitted to PPH with possible heart problems as I have past history of heart attacks.  \r\nI was admitted to ward 4.

At 25weeks I had some light bleeding and went to maternity assessment. The consultant scanned me as there was no record of my placenta position in my 20week scan notes. The consultant explained that there was an extra lobe on my placenta but wanted to get another consultant to review this. The second consultant confirmed that my placenta was low lying and showed me the second lobe on the scan. I’ve recently had a 32week scan to check the position of the placenta to determine how I progress from here. That scan has shown that the placenta has moved up sufficiently and that there is no evidence at all of a lobe. The consultant who saw me after the 32week scan explained that there had been nothing recorded in my notes by either of the consultants who saw me at 25weeks? That they’d only documented that placenta was low-lying. I have been worrying for a month or so and am now really confused as to why the concern about the lobe was never documented- it is not something I had ever heard about before so it wouldn’t have entered my head unless they’d raised it. My pregnancy is reverting to green path which is great but I’m now riddled with doubt about what was observed and why my notes vary so drastically from what was communicated verbally? Worried more now that I will be anxious through rest of pregnancy and labour because of doubt over what the truth is!","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-03-12T23:04:21.0366667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-03-15T14:04:12.87","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":9}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/831854","id":"831854"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/831854/responses","id":"831854"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/831854/healthservices","id":"831854"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/831854/tags","id":"831854"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sj9qe-501","id":"sj9qe-501","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sj9qe-matassesmenttriage","id":"sj9qe-matassesmenttriage","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxious","id":"anxious"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/concern","id":"concern"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confused","id":"confused"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/worried","id":"worried"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bleeding","id":"bleeding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/labour","id":"labour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lobe","id":"lobe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/maternity","id":"maternity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/placenta","id":"placenta"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pregnancy","id":"pregnancy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/record%20keeping","id":"record keeping"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scan","id":"scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/consistency%20of%20care","id":"consistency of care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/accuracy%20of%20notes","id":"accuracy of notes"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/832135","id":"832135"}]},{"id":831855,"author":"cetuskt46","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Haematology","body":"Dr Finnegan and clinical nurse specialist Caroline are fabulous.

After being a dependent user of cannabis for well over 5 years and using it for 20 years the paranoia and insecurity finally caught up with me.  \r\nI had been given some \"weed\" but one of the paramedics that attended on the night suggested that it may have been something other than just weed...  \r\nI was taken to A+E and was assessed and later discharged. During the assessment, I was offered some counseling through change grow live and before the lady even finished the sentence I knew I needed the support of CGL.  \r\nMy circumstances are probably different to a lot of people but everyone's story is different i suppose I lost my job, my independence my pride, and what little confidence I had was completely stripped away. Anger and escape was the reason I started using full time. A chance to escape my situation and float away into oblivion often starting first thing in the morning.  \r\nI knew I had a dependency on cannabis but never thought it was a problem. I mean, I was only doing myself harm, and yeah I was short-tempered and unless you knew me the image I must have projected was of a bitter and angry person.  \r\nI had been offered help from the Healthcare profession in the past but never really committed to any of the services offered, lack of trust, and ultimately preferring to work my own problems out through introspection and a doob.

Everyone was very kind and calm and you felt you were in the hands of a well practised care system. After the operation I was soon back in my private en suite room on the ward, with lovely views across the fields. I was on my feet with the physios in the afternoon and a whole range of nurses and cheerful health care assistants were constantly checking on me. The hospitality team that served food were very well dressed, polite and happy and the menu to choose from was extensive and good quality. Everyone, including the porters and the cleaners were polite and cheerful. It seemed like they all enjoyed working at Circle. It seems harsh to compare this hospital with an NHS hospital when we know the staff are struggling to do a great job (and mostly achieving it), particularly post Covid, with not enough government funding but being in a building that was well designed, with good decor and having a quiet private room without hearing other patients at nights aided my recovery. Things happen on time which again is the beauty of a hospital dedicated to elective surgery and not having to deal with emergency admissions. I felt thoroughly well cared for and it such a shame that the NHS cannot hope to match this experience due to lack of funding and bureaucracy.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2021-03-15T17:20:25","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2021-03-15T18:40:15","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/832208","id":"832208"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/832208/responses","id":"832208"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/832208/healthservices","id":"832208"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/832208/tags","id":"832208"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/nv302","id":"NV302","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20cared%20for","id":"not cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20about","id":"Cared about"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency","id":"emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/feet","id":"feet"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good","id":"good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/great","id":"great"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hearing","id":"hearing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20good","id":"not good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/operation","id":"operation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/well%20cared%20for","id":"well cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20for","id":"cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cheerful","id":"cheerful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happy","id":"happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hope","id":"Hope"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/no%20hope","id":"no hope"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20happy","id":"not happy"}]},{"id":832215,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Amazing","body":"Contacted the surgery following health concerns, used the App which was an easy and efficient way to arrange a triage consultation.

What could have been a very stressful night was made easier by their support. It was particularly appreciated when one of the sisters proactively brought me a more comfortable bed even though I hadn't asked for one. I cannot fault the treatment I received.
