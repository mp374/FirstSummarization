She’s by far the best midwife I have ever had! 2 months on from my sons birth I’m still absolutely elated I was able to have the homebirth I wanted, it was made even more special by the lovely midwives, May and Mandy, that attended my sons birth. I had the most amazing, positive experience and cannot thank them enough. Jane took over from Mandy after my son arrived and allowed me to just lay on the sofa cuddling my newborn, she even tried to tidy up my house which was so lovely!! I think it’s such a shame the homebirth rates in Forth Valley are so low and I’d love to help change that. I’m really interested in starting a homebirth support group for expectant mums to get information and advice on homebirths.

After screams, tears, some first aid and a hurriedly cancelled sleepover, we arrived at A and E at 915 with upset Mum (she’d closed the door) and a worried 9yr old sister.  \r\nWe left 2 hrs later having been triaged, cleaned up, x-rayed, seen by a doctor, plastic surgeon, beautifully bandaged and got organised for an operation in a couple of days.  \r\nEveryone was kind, caring, skilled and, whilst obviously focusing on the patient, they also looked out for the rest of us.  \r\nIt was a wonderful example of the NHS, free at the point of need, when needed most.  \r\nThat was the Friday evening, Monday morning we arrive at Sick Kids way too early after a surprisingly successful attempt to miss the traffic - 715am.  \r\nAgain, all staff were caring, thoughtful and engaged wonderfully with her. There wasn’t a flicker of concern about our early arrival and my daughter was supported to tell her story and was fully involved and listened to (even down to remembering she liked her butter to be melted into her toast!). We brought her older sister, not realising siblings can’t be on the ward, which meant we tag teamed back and forth and she occasionally waited on the seats outside the ward for a few minutes whilst passing staff offered her toys and books.  \r\nI could wax lyrical about the skills of each person we met, but they were all excellent. One of the things that struck me was how children of similar ages and going through similar experiences were subtly grouped around the ward and in terms of their list place - this created additional support between patients and parents - good move.  \r\nSo, thank you all, Cleaners to Consultants, hero’s all.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-03-04T10:20:38.38","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2020-03-05T11:31:34.47","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lothian","count":12},{"name":"Scottish Government","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/746633","id":"746633"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/746633/responses","id":"746633"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/746633/healthservices","id":"746633"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/746633/tags","id":"746633"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/s225h_110","id":"S225H_110","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/s308h_180","id":"S308H_180","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/caring","id":"caring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/empathy","id":"empathy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/engaging","id":"engaging"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/finger","id":"finger"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kind","id":"kind"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/operation","id":"operation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/skilled%20staff","id":"skilled staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thoughtful","id":"thoughtful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported","id":"supported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wonderful","id":"wonderful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support%20for%20family","id":"support for family"}]},{"id":747043,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Good practice","body":"The service I recieved was excellent.

The amount of infant feeding support I received at both at the hospital and afterwards was phenomenal.  \r\nThe infant feeding support workers really made it possible for me to breastfeed my baby (which will be far more beneficial for the baby) in a difficult situation. I wouldn’t have managed without the infant feeding support workers.  \r\nOnce I got home, Daoine came to my house several times to help me use the nipple shields, which turned out to be the only way my daughter could get a latch. Subsequently I have enjoyed going to Daoine’s Feeding Support Group in Dingwall to meet other breastfeeding mums and exchange advice. I have tried other baby/toddler groups, and Daoine’s Feeding Support Group is the best.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-03-04T12:09:18.1966667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-03-05T11:36:11.68","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Highland","count":5},{"name":"Office of Rhoda Grant, MSP for Highlands and Islands","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/746672","id":"746672"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/746672/responses","id":"746672"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/746672/healthservices","id":"746672"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/746672/tags","id":"746672"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/h202h_501","id":"H202H_501","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sk9-highland-community-services-bfs","id":"sk9-highland-community-services-bfs","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breastfeeding%20support","id":"Breastfeeding Support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/enjoyable","id":"enjoyable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/group","id":"group"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nipple","id":"nipple"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support%20with%20feeding","id":"support with feeding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported","id":"supported"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/747098","id":"747098"}]},{"id":746674,"author":"m2345","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Still getting nowhere","body":"Last 2 appointments cancelled the day before by text, lovely how they tell us by 3 texts that each appointment costs £160 if a no show occurs !!  \r\nNow almost to the day its been 2 years since my pain started and still getting nowhere, each appointment months away.

My daughter had group b strep pneumonia and bacteria in her spinal fluid at 11 hours old. I felt they focused on my weight so much in my pregnancy that some things I.e the Group b strep would have been more important to look out for. But my labour and aftercare for myself and daughter was excellent on that account.  \r\nMy next experience was with my son. Labour ward staff were amazing. But after birth because they were moving hospitals the care for me and baby was bad. No help to breastfeed they were too busy with a skeleton staff. My son was accident cannulated and given antibiotics at 3 days old. After a number of precautions had already been taken. They did come and remove it 40 mins later. And the head off department apologised. I believe a midwife made a complaint for me.  \r\nAfter that my son developed RSV bronculitis at 7 days old. And honestly the doctors were amazing. A whole 10 days in hospital and we were treated well. A few problems I.e no help to breastfeed after my son came of cpap oxygen and having to wait a really long time with a screaming newborn waiting on the tube feed to come. It was hard to get any food or breaks for myself to eat as my family were all elsewhere allot of the time.  \r\nWe went home after a crazy week and I was very traumatised by it wall. And found that I wish someone had taken some time to talk with me about what happened. As I did not remember it all.. then I spent the next 6 monthes battling with my GPs because my son has asthma like symptoms but no one would listen until we ended up back in A&E and needing Oxygen. Then finally we got what we needed to help him.  \r\nWhen it comes to his peadiatric visits now the doctors are nice and caring. But the letters always have something wrong in them. Wither something missing or something is said the wrong way.  \r\nThe only other thing is my daughter has two swollen glands and they have been this way for years. I have been several times to have them checked and it still worries me that just looking is not enough. I wish my GP practice would do more in that way. And not make me feel like a paranoid individual. Even going into appointments and the doctor has no idea about my child's history. I think they maybe have a glance before you walk in?  \r\nI have also walked into an appointment made 3 weeks in advance. Told the doctor the problem and they have just said that is a health visitor problem...but mu experiences with most professionals is good.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-03-04T12:54:14.6","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2020-03-05T11:49:47.247","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Dumfries and Galloway","count":10},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/746682","id":"746682"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/746682/responses","id":"746682"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/746682/healthservices","id":"746682"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/746682/tags","id":"746682"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sy9-gp","id":"sy9-gp","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/y104h_501","id":"Y104H_501","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/y104h-acutemedicine","id":"y104h-acutemedicine","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/y104h-cau","id":"y104h-cau","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/y104h-outpatientservices","id":"y104h-outpatientservices","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/y104h-respiratory","id":"y104h-respiratory","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/should%20listen","id":"Should listen"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/aftercare","id":"aftercare"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/antibiotics","id":"antibiotics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/birth","id":"birth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breastfeeding%20support","id":"Breastfeeding Support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/caring","id":"caring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctors","id":"doctors"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/group","id":"group"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/incorrect%20medication","id":"incorrect medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/labour","id":"labour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mixed%20feelings","id":"mixed feelings"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/oxygen","id":"oxygen"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/patient%20records","id":"patient records"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pneumonia","id":"pneumonia"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pregnancy","id":"pregnancy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/spinal","id":"spinal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/traumatised","id":"traumatised"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/weight","id":"weight"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/well%20treated","id":"well treated"}]},{"id":746689,"author":"Janeth","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"What a brilliant service","body":"While visiting my mum in hospital, I thought I’d call in to audiology for some new batteries for my hearing aids.

Its a very busy doctors practice although the always try hard to , accommodate short notice Emergency appointments on the day if you telephone at 8.00 am   ","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-03-04T11:47:53","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2020-03-05T12:32:05","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/747074","id":"747074"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/747074/responses","id":"747074"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/747074/healthservices","id":"747074"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/747074/tags","id":"747074"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/p88012","id":"P88012","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/day%20surgery","id":"day surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency","id":"emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/filling","id":"filling"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good","id":"good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/operation","id":"operation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/relaxed","id":"relaxed"}]},{"id":747072,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Ear Ear","body":"I suffer from continuing wax build up in my right ear.

Medically with regards to investigations I cannot fault the team at all. They have been very thorough in trying to find out what was wrong with me. However i feel that I need to provide feedback with regards to the lack of support I received as a breast feeding mother.  \r\nThey prescribed me oramorph to manage my pain while I was admitted, which took the edge off but I was still In a lot of pain. At time of discharge I was and still am in significant pain and weary about how I was going to manage my pain at home and continue breastfeeding. Being in close contact with my daughter who needs the comfort and security of breastfeeding, I needed to ensure it was safe for me to feed her. While I was in hospital I had no choice not to feed my daughter temporarily, and continuously voiced my concerns to medical staff about my need to continue breast feeding when I go home. My daughter was brought to see me while I was in hospital and had to be taken away after 5 minutes as she was so distressed at not being allowed to nurse from me.  \r\nWhen I was told I was being discharged to come back as an outpatient for endoscopy, I told them I was worried about how I was going to cope with pain and that I need something to allow me to breastfeed as my daughter will get distressed if I’m there and she cannot nurse and this would be distressing for me too. So they said they would get the pain nurse to come and see me.  \r\nThe pain nurse seen me very briefly , and advised I would be sent home with cocodamol. I have been told that breastfeeding mothers definitely can’t take cocodamol so I said that I couldn’t take cocodamol. I was told I would just need to stop breastfeeding to manage my pain. I asked if they could give me dihydrocodeine instead, and had to argue my case that cocodamol made me feel sick and i have tolerated dihydrocodeine in the past, as any time I mentioned breastfeeding I was made to feel like I had no choice but to stop. Even when I said I was prescribed dihydrocodeine when my baby was first born, they wouldn't change from cocodamol. But did once I told them I couldn’t tolerate it and needed adequate pain relief, then the prescription was changed. So I was discharged with dihydrocodeine but was told I was not allowed to continue breastfeeding. I insisted this isn’t something I want to do, but was told that I would need to stop. They did say that she would go and find out about dihydrocodeine when breastfeeding and get back to me after I asked to look into it before I go. But they never came back. The Ward nurse came with my discharge meds and i asked if I could breastfeed and was again told no.  \r\nI had to go home and endure my daughter screaming and distressed because I was at home and she couldn’t nurse from me when she obviously needed this nurturing after missing me while I was in hospital. When the comfort of my breast is all she has known when she is upset since she was born. I had to hide from her in the bedroom and was very upset myself. I spent the whole night in agony as I felt I couldn’t take any pain relief until I know I am safely able to breastfeed my baby. As stopping for us simply is not an option.  \r\nWhen I woke up this morning I called the infant feeding team at Wishaw general for advice on taking medication. I couldn’t call before as it was out of hours. They spoke to the pharmacist for me to see if the morphine from yesterday would be out of my system and and advised me that I can in fact continue breastfeeding while taking dihydrocodeine and I was right in refusing cocodamol while breastfeeding . I feel that I was rushed out the door with lack of knowledge and support to protect the infant mother breastfeeding relationship and no concern about the emotional stress this would cause for my baby and for myself with pain and feeling unwell on top of it. My breastfeeding did not feel like a priority to medical staff despite me continuously expressing how much a priority it was to me throughout my admission.  \r\nI was moved to a communal room with other patients and closed my curtains so I had privacy to express. I can’t use an electric pump anyway so have little suction cups to catch letdown and I need to hand express. And because I was away from my baby for so long and on morphine and nil by mouth I had to wear these continuously and try and stimulate milk production in order to maintain a supply for when I was discharged, there was a man in the bed next to mine and lots visitors at the other beds throughout the day. So I wasn’t comfortable having the curtains open to express. I wasn’t comfortable even with them closed and found it hard to relax to express which is an important factor as well. But I had no control over that. All I could do was close the curtains. But on several occasions, staff would walk in and out and try to open the curtains and I had to repeatedly show them what I was doing for them to close them again. I found it humiliating having to repeatedly justify why I needed privacy and especially humiliating that everyone in the room knew what I was doing as they heard me having to explain time and time again. I’m a very private person and having people hear and know that I'm am sitting behind a curtain with my boobs out trying to stimulate them to produce milk is mortifying and I found it quite distressing. At one point i overheard two staff members outside the room talking about me and I felt it was in a judgemental tone. One asked why I was not opening the curtains and the other said that I was expressing, the first then asked why I was doing that, and the other replied “god knows”.Any time a clinical support came in for something I felt as though they were ignorant towards me and annoyed at me for not having the curtains open. Although they didn’t say anything, I felt that the way way they interacted with me was cold and I felt as though I was doing something to annoy them. In the end I just looked away and never made eye contact with them. Breastfeeding is a huge thing to me as a mother and to my daughter who is thriving having the nurturing and health benefits of breast milk. The world health organisation recommends breastfeeding to age 2 and beyond. There are lots of health benefits to the mother as well. And I especially feel this as it helps my chronic health condition of fibromyalgia and my mental health problems depression and anxiety. It helps me get a deep level of restorative sleep that lacks in fibromyalgia sufferers, and I was greatly affected by not having this restful sleep before breastfeeding which really affected my ability to function day to day. It also helps boost serotonin and oxytocin levels to regulate my depression and anxiety and avoid going back on medication for it while my baby is so young. So it’s not just a case of stopping breastfeeding, it’s the impact it will have on many aspects of me and my daughters well-being.  \r\nThe reason I felt I needed to express my opinion is I feel that more knowledge and understanding of breastfeeding within the department is clearly needed. I feel as health professionals you should be able to support breastfeeding as much as possible. Even just knowing to contact the infant support team for advice, who have access to pharmacists who have in depth knowledge about medication and breastfeeding would be a start. I could have been discharged with a plan to support my breastfeeding and control my pain instead of being told to stop breastfeeding due to a lack of knowledge. The resources are available to you within NHS Lanarkshire and for a breastfeeding mother to be discharged with little regard to the importance of breastfeeding I find it deeply concerning. Especially after such a distressing night of pain and a distressed upset baby which could have been completely avoided.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-03-05T11:57:59.5766667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-03-05T12:33:23.643","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lanarkshire","count":6},{"name":"NHS Education for Scotland","count":1},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2020)","count":3},{"name":"Sheffield University Medical School 2020","count":1},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":1},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2021)","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/747048","id":"747048"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/747048/responses","id":"747048"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/747048/healthservices","id":"747048"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/747048/tags","id":"747048"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l302h-sru","id":"l302h-sru","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/annoyed","id":"annoyed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stress","id":"stress"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/worried","id":"worried"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/abdominal","id":"abdominal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breast%20feeding","id":"breast feeding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breastfeeding%20support","id":"Breastfeeding Support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/consideration","id":"consideration"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/depression","id":"depression"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/distressed","id":"distressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fibromyalgia","id":"fibromyalgia"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/important","id":"important"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/in%20control","id":"in control"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/judgemental","id":"judgemental"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medical%20care","id":"medical care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/morphine","id":"morphine"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain%20management","id":"pain management"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/privacy","id":"privacy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/rushed","id":"rushed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attitude","id":"staff attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thorough","id":"thorough"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/understanding","id":"understanding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/on%20edge","id":"on edge"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breastfeeding%20knowledge","id":"breastfeeding knowledge"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/chronic%20health%20condition","id":"chronic health condition"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/748193","id":"748193"}]},{"id":747075,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Atrocious service","body":"Had trouble with this service last year- cancelled appts at short notice, unable to complain, a complete barrier to accessing the knee replacement I need.

I was told to get my ear syringed. I spoke to the receptionist at the time and was told I could get it done two days later, but I wanted to get back to work ASAP so I decided to call in the morning to see if there were cancellations. I call this morning to be told that ear syringing is ONLY DONE on Mondays, and the next appointment was nearly 3 weeks away. They then said they could check another practice to see if they had anything available. Maybe 20 seconds later they tell me no. I call this same practice and they DO have an appointment available in 3 days for this to be done. Unfortunately, I needed THIS practice to call them in order to get this appointment. Obviously that wasn't going to happen, and obviously the person I spoke to this morning didn't actually check with this practice like they said they did. I'm now going to the walk in because I don't even need an appointment to get it done there, and I much rather wait a couple hours to get it done than three whole weeks.
