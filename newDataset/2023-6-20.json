Had CT scan next day and was discharged, assuming there was no risk and I'd have the procedure done at a later date.  \r\nWithin an hour of being at home my leg went purple, nearly passed out and was sweating profusely. Was rushed to hospital and ferried straight through A&E and underwent emergency surgery to save my leg.  \r\nLuckily, the surgeons saved my leg, nearly bled out on operating table, spent 6 days on ICU, where I nearly bled out again, spent 7 weeks on vascular ward (C18B), nurses were phenomenal on there, everything was top notch apart from fact that I was discharged from C22 ward.  \r\nIf only someone would have looked at my CT results I would have never been discharged. I hold whoever signed my discharge and didn't look at CT results responsible for this. I nearly lost my leg and my life.  \r\nI cannot believe I was discharged in such a serious situation, absolutely shocking!","criticality":"strongly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-06-15T11:10:12.1633333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-06-20T08:24:51.083","readBy":[{"name":"East Lancashire Hospitals NHS Trust","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1078896","id":"1078896"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1078896/responses","id":"1078896"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1078896/healthservices","id":"1078896"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1078896/tags","id":"1078896"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rxr10_180","id":"RXR10_180","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rxr20_107","id":"RXR20_107","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/angry","id":"angry"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/shocked","id":"shocked"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood","id":"blood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20clot","id":"blood clot"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cancellation","id":"cancellation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ct","id":"ct"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ct%20scan","id":"CT scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/discharge","id":"discharge"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency%20surgery","id":"emergency surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/results","id":"results"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scan","id":"scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vascular","id":"vascular"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/icu","id":"icu"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1080664","id":"1080664"}]},{"id":1080323,"author":"Ayrpatient1","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"All done in less than two hours","body":"I would like to thank Stewart the Advanced Practitioner for his kindness, professionalism and care on my recent trip to Ayr ED.  \r\nIt was very busy in waiting room but I was taken quickly, my injury carefully listened and an indepth assessment on my low back conducted.

I was very depressed at this point and was admitted to Midpark hospital. I spent just under a year there where I was diagnosed with EUPD and Recurring Depression. The care I received from nurses was exemplary. However, the hospital care I received in subsequent admission was seriously lacking with me making several serious attempts and just told I had capacity as an excuse to give no extra help.  \r\nIn August 2020 I was not offered any help despite saying I was going to end my life. No community support or other options, they just said I clearly wanted to die and there was nothing they could do about that. I left intending to harm myself. The staff then phoned the police despite being told by one of them suggesting I could kill myself if I wanted. I believe whether you have capacity or not you should be offered help and not made to feel like death is your only option.  \r\nHowever, after the police stopped me and told my family to phone the police if I left the house I had some more period of instability. In and out of hospital which thanks to the 72 hours policy were no help and against nice guidelines. The failure of doctors in my care is almost made up for the wonderful nurses who I am very grateful to have had in my life.  \r\nThese nurses not only in Midpark and CATS who are all for the most part equally amazing. Annandale and Eskdale CMHT are the reason I’m still here. They have spent 1000s of hours talking to me, crying with me and laughing with me through it all. They have taken my phone calls when I’ve been at the end, stuck up for me against doctors who hold a deep rooted stigma against EUPD (need more training) and celebrated my milestones with me. I want to say a special thank you to my wonderful CPN. They have supported me from just before I spent a year in hospital to now where I am now holding down a job and moving to a new area for this job and have not self-harmed for 6 months.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-06-13T23:45:57.24","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-06-20T08:52:02.91","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Dumfries and Galloway","count":12}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1078255","id":"1078255"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1078255/responses","id":"1078255"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1078255/healthservices","id":"1078255"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1078255/tags","id":"1078255"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sy9-commservices-cmht","id":"sy9-commservices-cmht","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sy9-midpark-hospital-adult-psychiatry","id":"sy9-midpark-hospital-adult-psychiatry","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care%20failure","id":"care failure"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lacking%20care","id":"lacking care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cmht","id":"cmht"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cpn","id":"cpn"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/depressed","id":"depressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/depression","id":"depression"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctor","id":"doctor"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/eupd","id":"eupd"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good%20job","id":"good job"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hospital%20care","id":"hospital care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/no%20help","id":"no help"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nursing%20care","id":"nursing care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/police","id":"police"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/suicide","id":"suicide"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supportive%20staff","id":"supportive staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wonderful%20care","id":"wonderful care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wonderful","id":"wonderful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/personal%20progress","id":"personal progress"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/celebration","id":"celebration"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wonderful%20nurses","id":"wonderful nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing%20nurses","id":"amazing nurses"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1080819","id":"1080819"}]},{"id":1079219,"author":"Phil90378","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Colonoscopy at Raigmore Hospital","body":"I was booked to have an endoscopy and colonoscopy with sedation.  \r\nI have the endoscopy first and was adequately sedated for this procedure as wasn’t aware it had been done.

They can’t book me an appointment , been told to call back around 11am , so I did , but while on the phone for almost half an hour I decided to drove there in the surgery and saw them not busy and just ignoring the calls, while staffs just chatting around and I told the receptionist  I’m still on my phone call but no wants answering ? Really poor service. Receptionist cannot give me an early appointment, the earliest one is after a month .  All I want is just a phone from the GP to request a routine blood test . Now they told me to call again around 2 pm for a face to face appointment, which is going to waste of time again, all they will do is to give me the printed blood test request that they can normally sent me a link to book in the hospital.

Diagnosed with an ear infection and given antibiotic drops and tablets even after I told him I could not take oral antibiotics.  The tablets made me I’ll so I continued with the ear drops.  Made another appointment still with a two month wait.  In the meantime Googled my symptoms of Tinnitus in one ear. Was extremely alarmed to see that if it n one ear only this must always be considered to be a red flag.  As the wait was so long and none of the staff were answering the phone I paid privately to see someone else.  Was sent for an immediate MRI scan and then given diagnosis of Acoustic Neuroma.  I have now changed my GP practice as this was the final straw. Such a change to have a receptionist who not only answers the phone but actually looks at you and smiles instead of treating you with contempt. Kingsbury have some terrible reviews on their web site and something should really be done about that practice.   I stood them for thirty years and had almost got used to having to drive there when I wanted to speak to them .   The staff were never busy and did their best to ignore patients.  I should have left long ago and I would recommend that everyone else do the same","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2023-06-19T12:00:30","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2023-06-20T09:21:16","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1080478","id":"1080478"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1080478/responses","id":"1080478"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1080478/healthservices","id":"1080478"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1080478/tags","id":"1080478"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/m84006","id":"M84006","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/acoustic","id":"acoustic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/alarmed","id":"alarmed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/antibiotics","id":"antibiotics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diagnosis","id":"diagnosis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ear","id":"ear"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/infection","id":"infection"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mri","id":"mri"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mri%20scan","id":"MRI scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/oral","id":"oral"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scan","id":"scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/terrible","id":"terrible"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tinnitus","id":"tinnitus"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/considered","id":"considered"}]},{"id":1080325,"author":"piscesbh47","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"They abruptly ended the call","body":"I fainted randomly while sat down and had tingly legs and arms - explained this.

I called with a genuine concern, hoping to receive some medical advice or assistance, but what I encountered was a series of issues that left me feeling utterly dissatisfied. The amount of time I had to spend on the phone was absolutely ridiculous.  I was left waiting for an excruciating 65 minutes before someone finally bothered to answer my call.\n\nUnfortunately, the receptionist who eventually picked up was not only unhelpful, but also remarkably rude. Instead of showing empathy or attempting to understand my situation, they were dismissive and seemed disinterested in helping me. I expected a certain level of professionalism and courtesy from a healthcare provider, but this receptionist's attitude left much to be desired.\n\nI was taken aback when the receptionist did not even bother to ask about my symptoms or concerns. Instead, they immediately informed me that the practice was fully booked and advised me to call back the next day. This lack of willingness to even listen to my concerns made me question the level of care and attention that patients receive at Mission Medical Practice.\n\nOverall, my experience with Mission Medical Practice was extremely disappointing. The excessively long phone wait times, rude receptionist, lack of concern for my symptoms, and the dismissive attitude left me feeling neglected and undervalued as a patient. I expected better from a healthcare provider, and I strongly recommend considering other options if you are seeking prompt and compassionate care.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2023-06-19T12:13:41","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2023-06-20T09:32:40","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1080491","id":"1080491"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1080491/responses","id":"1080491"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1080491/healthservices","id":"1080491"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1080491/tags","id":"1080491"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/f84016","id":"F84016","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dissatisfied","id":"dissatisfied"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frustrating","id":"frustrating"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/neglected","id":"neglected"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/better","id":"better"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/informed","id":"informed"}]},{"id":1080489,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"So far, outstanding. ","body":"Since joining Schopwick last year, I have found an individual GP that offers me continuity of care for a complexed medical situation, fantastic would be an understatement when it comes to my preferred doctor. I cannot offer enough praise for them. \n\nSecondly, in my personal experience, I have found the staff at the surgery to be friendly, communicative & helpful. \n\nThe administration staff have always offered the choice of face to face or telephone appointment.\n\nFurthermore, the options offered and service for patients are intuitive and thoughtful: \n\ntext services for: \n-Doctor patient communication outside of appointments.\n- Community engagement events\n- Local health circumstances \n- Upcoming appointments  \n\nOnline communication with the practice:\nYou can use a service they offer called “Patchs” through their website and contact the practice, you can ask for your preferred practitioner & explain your circumstances this will lead to further action such as an appointment with your doctor. \nYou can request repeat prescriptions here also. \n\nI am a patient at this practice & I am happy with the practice right now. \n\nAs we all know things can change, however that doesn’t just have to be negative change. \n\nI would urge any patient to speak to their practice, find a preferred doctor that you like, trust & feel you can communicate openly and freely with. \n\nThis will greatly improve your relationship with your GP practice & in your times of need, you will feel much more comfortable in arranging treatment. \n\nRemember outside of emergency appointments, so long as your preferred doctor is available it is your right as a patient within the NHS to be able to see the doctor or nurse of your choosing :) \n\nThis is not a reflection of anything other than our personal preferences and who we feel comfortable seeing and sharing our health concerns with.  \n\nHaving had the unfortunate experience of having to deal with a truly woeful practice in the past. As of mid 2023 I rate schopwick as outstanding, true to their current CQC rating.  \n\nI hope that Schopwick continue to work so openly with their patients and strive for even more, servicing the local community & giving their patients peace of mind that when they need help, it’s there & it’s going to be ok. \n\nFinally, I would urge anyone who is unhappy to seek change, try a different Doctor, Schopwick I believe is a training GP practice, so there’s lots of new doctors and also a group of really fantastic experienced doctors. \n\nCommunicate, you may find someone right for you that can really help. \n\nLike anything, no body or entity should be above criticism or beneath praise, my review is based on current personal experience & is subject to change both positively and negatively.\n\nThanks for reading this novel of a review!

However, the doctors exceptional approach made all the difference.\n\nThe Doctor demonstrated remarkable consideration and empathy towards my son. He took the time to explain the entire procedure, showing him the equipment being used and reassuring him that feeling nervous in new situations is perfectly normal. Thanks to his caring demeanor, my son felt more at ease, and the doctor was able to successfully take his blood on the first attempt.\n\nThe compassionate and patient approach displayed by the doctor truly transformed what could have been a horrible appointment into a much more positive experience. I am immensely grateful for his assistance and wanted to express my heartfelt appreciation.\n\nI also want to mention the exceptional service provided by the rest of the nurses and receptionists at the surgery. They have always been polite and go above and beyond to assist whenever I call.\n\nOverall, our visit to Ninfield Surgery and the exceptional care we received from the doctor and the entire team has left a lasting impression. We sincerely hope that Dr pm knows just how much of a positive impact he has made, and I would highly recommend his services to others in need of medical care.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2023-06-19T13:56:49","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2023-06-20T09:46:59","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1080521","id":"1080521"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1080521/responses","id":"1080521"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1080521/healthservices","id":"1080521"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1080521/tags","id":"1080521"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/g81077001","id":"G81077001","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxious","id":"anxious"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/apprehensive","id":"apprehensive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nervous","id":"nervous"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood","id":"blood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20test","id":"blood test"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fortunate","id":"fortunate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/horrible","id":"horrible"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/more%20positive","id":"more positive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/normal","id":"normal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/positive","id":"positive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/test","id":"test"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appreciation","id":"appreciation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hope","id":"Hope"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20grateful","id":"very grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/made%20a%20difference","id":"made a difference"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20ease","id":"at ease"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thanks","id":"thanks"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/no%20hope","id":"no hope"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20nervous","id":"very nervous"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20at%20ease","id":"not at ease"}]},{"id":1080524,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Stressful","body":"Like fort knox, impossible to get access,  no clear instructions, pressed buzzer which made noise, door remained closed, no communication from staff on the entry system.

They should be put in a separate room if that's the case and wait their turn like the rest of us away from everyone else trying to deal with their own issues as to why they were in A & E.\n\nA 6 1/2 hour wait is totally outrageous. Especially, having to sit on very uncomfortable seating the whole time, not knowing when you're going to be seen.\n\nWhen my husband asked if he could be told when he would be seeing a doctor, the answer she gave was, \"I don't know\". Again, this is very wrong. You have computer systems and everyone checks in and all the details are entered when obs are taken, bloods etc.\n\nThe system is totally broken and needs to be fixed. Us hard working people haven't worked all our lives, paying our national insurance to have to deal with this every time you need help with a medical issue at a & e or any department in the hospital for that matter.\n\nOn a side note, the staff were amazing and we have no complaints there at all. They work very hard and do the best with what they have been given.\n","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2023-06-19T15:29:30","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-06-20T09:57:01","readBy":[{"name":"Torbay and South Devon NHS Foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1080529","id":"1080529"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1080529/responses","id":"1080529"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1080529/healthservices","id":"1080529"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1080529/tags","id":"1080529"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/ra901","id":"RA901","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/broken","id":"broken"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unacceptable","id":"unacceptable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/uncomfortable","id":"uncomfortable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/like%20myself","id":"like myself"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1091558","id":"1091558"}]},{"id":1080545,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Excellent service ","body":" I attended after GP advised me I may have a blood clot, very concerned & attended as advised for d dimer bloods, was triaged quickly the 2 triage nurses settled my worries, waited maybe 10 mins went through to a Nurse & phlebotomist, the bloods were taken & seeing as the phlebotomist was training the nurse beside her must surely be the best teacher as I have bloods taken regularly as diabetic & always have massive bruising just one of them things but have to say afterwards I couldn't even see where the bloods were taken & 2 days after only have a minimal bruise \"excellent\" & the Nurse was outstanding, done exactly what she said she was going to do & rang me with blood results.

The practice is also constantly seeking new ways to support their patients. For example, Robin Lane was an early adopter of Systmonline and have recently engaged with the new PATCHs system . These are all designed to support patients that need to speak to or have a face-to-face appointment with either a GP, a nurse or both. And the systems are intuitive and work extremely well. The practice itself is light and airy and the staff are happy and well motivated. I know most of the staff by name and they are always welcoming. And the practice worked seamlessly through one of the arguably most challenging times in recent history, the Pandemic.

I struggled with them: not only did I find them intrusive but they reactivated part of the trauma I had come to seek help with. I explained it right from the start, through tears, to the therapist but still felt pressured into completing it, despite my reasons and its impact on me being clear. After having a discussion with management about my specific circumstances, the therapist later gave me an ultimatum: either I complete the questionnaires at every session or I am discharged. \n\nExplanations attempting to justify the decision were that these questionnaires are a therapeutic tool and an active part of treatment. However, Trent pts chronically failed to even acknowledge that patients are individuals with diverse needs and histories, hence making their questionnaires not necessarily beneficial to everyone, even detrimental to some, as proved where I am concerned. \n\nTheir website claims to put patients at the centre of decisions made together, based on individual circumstances but in my experience, policy was implemented rigidly, insensitively and at any cost, despite having been made aware of the implications. \n\nTriggering a patient’s trauma for scoring purposes is clearly more important to this service than delivering the help needed to heal from it, which I find utterly shocking coming from a mental health organisation, which on top of everything else, is a public service supposed to be accessible to everyone in need. \n\nFollowing my experience with Trent pts, my mental and emotional health have not improved: on the contrary, they have deteriorated considerably. It is hard enough asking for help, and being made to feel like you are disqualified from receiving help changes your attitude towards seeking it. It is by far the worst experience I have had in terms of receiving therapeutic help. \n","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2023-06-19T17:32:14","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2023-06-20T10:07:48","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1080569","id":"1080569"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1080569/responses","id":"1080569"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1080569/healthservices","id":"1080569"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1080569/tags","id":"1080569"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/nls","id":"NLS","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/concerned","id":"concerned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/depression","id":"depression"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emotional","id":"emotional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/foot","id":"foot"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/important","id":"important"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pressured","id":"pressured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20concerned","id":"very concerned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/like%20myself","id":"like myself"}]},{"id":1080566,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Good Response!","body":"I have a worrying condition and Pinn medical were very good in managing it.\nBooking the appointment was quite straightforward,  was given a prompt appointment as my condition is worrying.\nNeeded some further test and the receptionist was very accomodating in arranging them. \nConsidering everything,  I  don't think Pinn medical could do more quite frankly","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2023-06-19T17:34:49","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-06-20T10:08:00","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1080566","id":"1080566"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1080566/responses","id":"1080566"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1080566/healthservices","id":"1080566"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1080566/tags","id":"1080566"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/e84024","id":"E84024","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20good","id":"not good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/test","id":"test"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1083636","id":"1083636"}]},{"id":1080565,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"terrible","body":"cannot get an appointment... can't even speak to a human being!

We then were asked to see a second triage nurse who wanted a more detailed history.  \r\nMy mum through her pain, tried to explain her complex history as well as how she was discharged recently from a ward (failed discharge). My Mum was then basically made to feel bad about attending a&e and why had she not tried other services. I stepped in to explain that currently she is being failed by the other services and that it's been a fight just to try and manage her pain. We were then told we would need to wait 6 hours to see a doctor, with no offer of pain relief, and that we should explore other avenues.  \r\nI asked if they could phone the surgical team and see if my Mum could be readmitted directly. Several phonecalls later and we were told that they would need a GP referal. I went out and phoned the GP who was disgusted and arranged for her to be admitted. I was fortunate to be able to have a professional to professional discussion. However not everyone is this fortunate.  \r\nI work in healthcare and know how stretched and underfunded services are. I would explore alternative avenues normally, however my Mum was in so much pain and so dehydrated it wasn't appropriate to try and wait with her history.  \r\nWhilst I do not blame staff directly, the Hospital have failed my Mum on numerous occasions and as they do not wish to be a burden and highlight at the time, its always gone unsaid. It breaks my Heart when I hear lack of basic compassion and patient management. I have experience of several hospitals and on this occasion I feel that this hospital has failed in its basic duty of care.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-06-20T07:57:05.2566667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-06-20T10:30:04.463","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Forth Valley","count":8}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1080422","id":"1080422"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1080422/responses","id":"1080422"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1080422/healthservices","id":"1080422"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1080422/tags","id":"1080422"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/forth-valley-royal-ae","id":"forth-valley-royal-ae","score":2},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/angry","id":"angry"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sad","id":"sad"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dehydrated","id":"dehydrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/empathy","id":"empathy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/failed","id":"failed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gp","id":"GP"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain%20management","id":"pain management"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain%20relief","id":"pain relief"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/patient%20management","id":"patient management"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/service%20availability","id":"service availability"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/severe%20pain","id":"severe pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attitude","id":"staff attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgical%20team","id":"surgical team"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/triage","id":"triage"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassion","id":"compassion"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/a&e%20triage","id":"A&E triage"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1087049","id":"1087049"}]},{"id":1080600,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"'The Good Doctor'","body":"I normally see the same (a.s) doctor, who is 'the good doctor', as my doc is always in tune of my needs regards to my well being, health condition & issues.

I did in the end get a lift but as its a 2 hour drive we had to leave at 6am. then I had to ask another person to collect me.  \r\nI think if you are not allowed to drive the hospital should arrange patient transport for you.
