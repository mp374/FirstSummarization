Remember this it was a stressful time for us as her parents as we expected the worst.  \r\nFrom the minute we started speaking to Lauren to get this operation booked in to arriving, every single staff member was amazing with us from start to finish!  \r\nThe morning of her operation was the scariest day of our lives but again the team at Glasgow children’s ward got us through with their fantastic support.  \r\nAfter our daughter came back round and we got to see her it was a massive relief as what we expected wasn’t there. The next few days were tough seeing her wee face swollen but again was nowhere near what we expected and she recovered amazing within the week.  \r\nOn behalf of myself my partner and my daughter we can’t thank enough the children's ward, the surgeons and everyone else who played a massive role in her time at the hospital.  \r\nThe outcome of this operation is amazing and the staff are absolutely fantastic I have never been to a hospital and felt so welcomed and had that much support from all involved!  \r\nAgain we can’t thank yous enough.  \r\nLots of love.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-03-22T17:02:18.54","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-03-25T09:09:45.03","readBy":[{"name":"Office of Annabelle Ewing, MSP for Cowdenbeath","count":1},{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":11}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/925640","id":"925640"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/925640/responses","id":"925640"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/925640/healthservices","id":"925640"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/925640/tags","id":"925640"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sj9-children--surgery","id":"sj9-children--surgery","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scared","id":"scared"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing%20staff","id":"amazing staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/head","id":"head"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/operation","id":"operation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/relief","id":"relief"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported","id":"supported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/craniofacial%20surgery","id":"craniofacial surgery"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/926623","id":"926623"}]},{"id":925704,"author":"Tomo68","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Steroid injection from exemplary staff","body":"I went in to Cannock Hospital for steroid injections.

Simon, one of the technicians, chatted to me throughout the short procedure and kept me engaged to the point that the doctor was applying the dressing before I realised it was done.  \r\nI can’t praise the staff in theatre enough, they do a high pressured job, often under stressful conditions and yet still manage to smile and put patients at ease. I wish I could name them all as they deserve recognition, but I only noted the name of Simon and Patrick who was another that kept my mind off the procedure.  \r\nOn leaving theatre I was handed over to Fay for more obs and finally on to Laura, both of whom were reassuring and informative. Laura provided me with coffee and biscuits. I was left for approximately 30 mins to rest and then Laura came in to check I could stand and walk before discharging me.  \r\nI have had a few hospital procedures over recent years, but I must say that Cannock Hospital and it’s staff are exemplary.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-03-22T20:44:16.87","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-03-25T09:12:30.443","readBy":[{"name":"The Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/925704","id":"925704"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/925704/responses","id":"925704"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/925704/healthservices","id":"925704"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/925704/tags","id":"925704"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rl4tc_110","id":"rl4tc_110","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/caring","id":"caring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dressing","id":"dressing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/efficient","id":"efficient"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/on%20time","id":"on time"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/personable","id":"Personable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professional","id":"professional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassuring","id":"reassuring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/steroid%20injections","id":"steroid injections"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20at%20ease","id":"put at ease"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/comfortable","id":"comfortable"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/927758","id":"927758"}]},{"id":925732,"author":"J0@nne","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Cancelled operation after admission to Day of Surgery Unit","body":"After my Day Procedure was cancelled because the anaesthetist wanted me admitted to the Day of Surgery, within the main hospital, I was rescheduled for another Covid Screening Test and then I was admitted to the day of surgery.  \r\nNumerous paperwork, tests and checks were completed and I was transferred into bed which took the effort and time of three nurses and a hoist (in a ward that was understaffed).

Learning to sleep with a face mask on was a learning curve but there was always support from the clinic when I needed it.  \r\nMy Sleep Apnoea journey began in 2010 and now, almost 12 years later, my condition is down in normal perimeters to around twice in an hour (and often less) that I stop breathing and I don't have that \"foggy\" feeling when I wake and I don't feel the need to nap frequently. I feel like a different person from how I was 12 years ago. My consultant always praises me for being 100% compliant and I never fail to take my CPAP machine away with me even when travelling abroad.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-03-23T14:19:12.36","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2022-03-25T11:34:36.03","readBy":[{"name":"United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust","count":8}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/925928","id":"925928"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/925928/responses","id":"925928"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/925928/healthservices","id":"925928"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/925928/tags","id":"925928"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rwdda","id":"RWDDA","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breathing","id":"breathing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/consultant","id":"consultant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diagnosis","id":"diagnosis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/face","id":"face"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/snoring","id":"snoring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/service","id":"service"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/condition%20management","id":"condition management"}]},{"id":926624,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Car parking shambles","body":"I recently visited my GP on 14/03/22 and duly paid my 50p to park upon leaving the car park.

I know my father is in a similar position having recently attended to see GP he paid his 50p in cash before leaving the car park.

It is clear that the machine is faulty as I also paid but still got a fine issued by post. I only have proof as I paid by contactless. You need to get a grip of this company and their clearly faulty machine. My dad and I cannot be the only ones this has happened to recently. I don’t see why my dad should be penalised for this when he knows he paid.

We were offered an assessment in November which was over the phone, we questioned how efficiently DID can be diagnosed over the phone but were told it can be.They were half an hour late calling which exasperated our anxiety. We found them to be immediately invalidating and quoting out of date knowledge. At the end of the traumatic one hour and twenty minute unstructured assessment we were so dissociated we were unable to remember what had happened.  \r\nThey repeatedly said that DID was rare, while some of the latest findings suggest it affects 1-3% of the population - it’s as common as red hair.We were told that we couldn’t have a diagnosis of DID as it isn’t in the ICD-10, which is right, but on the 1st January 2022 the ICD-11 was released, in which DID is now a diagnosable disorder, and services who are keeping themselves up to date have been diagnosing DID for months/years in anticipation of this change.  \r\nIt took a month for us to find out what was in the report, as we were bounced back and forth between our GP and SPA - neither who would even advise us of the diagnosis we had been given, let alone the contents of the report.  \r\nWhen we got the report we found that it entirely invalidates our experience, it diagnoses us with: “Mixed dissociative (conversion) disorder including symptoms of multiple personality disorder. Mixed personality disorder with traits of emotionally unstable, histrionic and anxious avoidant personality disorder”. We don’t understand how a diagnosis this comprehensive can be achieved over the phone in such a short space of time. There is no explanation of how or why we have mixed dissociative (conversion) disorder.  \r\nThe report states that we have projective identification - that others told us we have DID and we then manifested it. He questions that the abuse one of our alters, the host and alter who has lived most of the life, remembered in 2019 might be a false memory. We have a trauma holder who held the memory of that abuse for 36 years, she caused the decades of anxiety and depression and we are still trying to heal her. Another alter went to the police about the abuse. We are waiting to give our evidence - with a report that suggests it’s a false memory.  \r\nThe report states we cannot be self aware, when it had been explained to him the efforts it took to start to find her system, and the months of working with the first ‘found’ alter, while thinking this was her inner child. We wrote about the experience of ‘splitting’ before we had heard of DID, or had connected to anyone with a dissociative disorder.  \r\nSince then, staff from Walkley House Medical Centre have been advocating for us with SPA in our attempts to have an accurate diagnosis and seek the appropriate trauma-focused psychotherapy we need. But we’ve been told we will not be having another assessment and should try to find help with the diagnosis we have.  \r\nWe aren’t happy as we know of another case where there was an inaccurate diagnosis.  \r\nWe worry how many others are suffering because of the lack of knowledge about dissociative disorders. We’re often suicidal and suffering from the lack of support available. We don’t understand how a diagnosis this comprehensive and damning can be considered acceptable, without at least a second opinion to clarify.  \r\nWe will be writing to yourselves, the service, maybe some MPs. It’s taken us a few months to recover from the trauma of a shambolic assessment and diagnosis, but we won’t be quiet anymore. How many people has this service given inaccurate diagnoses to?  \r\n- J. (I’m our writer and can mostly speak objectively about things, but obviously several of us are angry) on behalf of the others.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-03-21T08:41:24.3666667","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2022-03-25T13:10:50.54","readBy":[{"name":"Healthwatch Sheffield","count":1},{"name":"Sheffield Health and Social Care NHS Foundation Trust","count":3}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/925246","id":"925246"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/925246/responses","id":"925246"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/925246/healthservices","id":"925246"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/925246/tags","id":"925246"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/tah_713","id":"TAH_713","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/angry","id":"angry"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/abuse","id":"abuse"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/depression","id":"depression"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diagnoses","id":"Diagnoses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diagnosis","id":"diagnosis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/did","id":"DID"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dissociative%20identity%20disorder","id":"Dissociative Identity Disorder"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/invalidated","id":"invalidated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/memory","id":"memory"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/multiple%20personality%20disorder","id":"Multiple Personality Disorder"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/personality%20disorder","id":"personality disorder"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/second%20opinion","id":"second opinion"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/suicidal","id":"suicidal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dissociative%20disorder","id":"dissociative disorder"}]},{"id":925938,"author":"Charlie2020","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"A two month stay after a stroke in Edgware Neurological Centre","body":"I had a stroke at the end of December 2021.

I called Aberdeen Neuro who would only confirm him to be on the referral list and nothing else. We were told to wait 6wks for the MRI results, which we have done but the GP still can not access them. We have to wait for the neuro specialist to see him, before going back to RCH to get results. This can be long enough. All adverts say stroke is an urgent 999 call, yet here we are, coming up to 5 months later and still no scan results. I keep getting told there is staff sickness and so everything is delayed. Why can the GP not give us the results, to start any required immediate treatment. Any delay and irreversible damage, we will lose forever. This is not acceptable, it’s preventable by reading a simple result and allowing us to start treatment. We only got the MRI by requesting a cancellation, which the staff at WGH radiology were really sympathetic about and got my husband squeezed in. As a family, we just want to know what’s going on and start treatment sooner rather than later, to help my husband. We have waited patiently but this is getting us nowhere with no answers.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-03-22T20:01:18.9166667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-03-25T13:50:58.823","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Grampian","count":7},{"name":"Aberdeen City Health & Social Care Partnership","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/925703","id":"925703"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/925703/responses","id":"925703"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/925703/healthservices","id":"925703"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/925703/tags","id":"925703"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/n101h_400","id":"N101H_400","score":2},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/n102h-radiology","id":"N102h-radiology","score":5},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/n198h","id":"N198H","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sn9-gp","id":"sn9-gp","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/worried","id":"worried"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/answers","id":"answers"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gp","id":"GP"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/memory","id":"memory"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/memory%20service","id":"memory service"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/neurologist","id":"Neurologist"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/radiology","id":"radiology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stroke","id":"stroke"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/urgency","id":"urgency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wait%20for%20results","id":"wait for results"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/927008","id":"927008"}]},{"id":926053,"author":"lotionsn68","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Embarrassed at attending sexual health clinic","body":"My coil was causing pain and discomfort with discharge.

They made me feel welcome despite the circumstances and made me feel calm throughout the entire visit.

I'm sorry but I am terrible with names. They did all the checks and bloods that needed to be done but if I'm honest with you, while it is A&E it really felt quite personal to me at my darkest time. They were calm, soft spoken and really really sweet. That made me feel really calm during that visit. They made sure I was comfortable at all times and if I needed assistance they were there almost instantly. Also good luck to the trainee nurse as well as she was amazing as well. Extremely caring and lovely.  \r\nThroughout the entire day when the shifts were swapped the other nurses were lovely as well, ensuring that I was okay and assisted me in a few things and if I was thirsty or hungry they always got me something.  \r\nThe communication with the nurses was great in which it flowed through nicely.

All staff introduced themselves.  \r\nArrived early in the morning, discharged at 18.00. From start to finish, could not fault a thing. Thankyou to each and everyone of them.

He is now in a side room at RVH and forgets to charge or turn his mobile on. \r\nAs we havent seen him and worrying that he thinks we have abandoned him i remembered being told my staff that i could het a zoom call. As we had phone calls to this point i didnt bother but things were different now so i rang Patient Liaison to arrange this. \r\nIt was handled, explained well and the same day i had a zoom call set up for that morning.\r\nThe link  was sent by email to which you respond. \r\nThe staff member on the connection was so helpful even when i had a few difficulties.   The Social Work person was friendly,helpful with helping dad to hear, understand (only partial hearing) and help the conversation along. As dad was tired it was only a few minutes but enough for us both to smile,talk and blow a kiss. \r\nThis really made me feel so much better knowing i could reassure dad and see the relief of seeing me.\r\nI highly recommend the service and thank you to all the staff .","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-03-25T13:42:51.3033333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-03-25T15:59:52.247","readBy":[{"name":"Belfast Health and Social Care Trust","count":4}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/926635","id":"926635"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/926635/responses","id":"926635"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/926635/healthservices","id":"926635"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/926635/tags","id":"926635"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt001-virtual-visiting","id":"ZT001-virtual-visiting","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/family%20contact","id":"Family contact"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly%20staff","id":"friendly staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helpful","id":"helpful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/virtual%20visiting","id":"virtual visiting"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/video%20contact","id":"video contact"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/927036","id":"927036"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/927233","id":"927233"}]},{"id":926315,"author":"avocetkh44","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Genital warts","body":"My genital warts have been treated and staff were amazing.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-03-24T19:00:24.2666667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-03-25T16:02:47.807","readBy":[{"name":"Midlands Partnership NHS Foundation Trust","count":3}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/926315","id":"926315"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/926315/responses","id":"926315"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/926315/healthservices","id":"926315"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/926315/tags","id":"926315"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rrex4-sexual-health-services-ss","id":"rrex4-sexual-health-services-ss","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/warts","id":"warts"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/927016","id":"927016"}]}]
