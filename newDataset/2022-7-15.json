I was having routine vaccinations and the nurse was extremely blunt and it seemed they were not trained in dealing with Autistic patients. They hurried me through the vaccines not giving me any information other than take paracetamol if it hurts, Autism trained nurses always explain exactly what is happening and help as much as possible, they also are supposed to offer a private room seeing a sunflower lanyard (which I was clearly wearing.)  \r\nThey were rough with the needles which were painful and bled lots, so much as so they bled through my t-shirt. They didn't apologize or anything.  \r\nI'm a wheelchair user so badly done needles mean I can't push myself for a few days. This takes away my freedom and the ability to leave my bed. Thanks to this I'm going to be scared for my next vaccine appointment and will leave me unable to move for about a week.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-07-13T13:18:58.7","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-07-15T08:12:42.96","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Dumfries and Galloway","count":9},{"name":"St. Andrews University ScotGEM Medical Students","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/956019","id":"956019"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/956019/responses","id":"956019"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/956019/healthservices","id":"956019"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/956019/tags","id":"956019"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/y110h-rehab","id":"Y110H-rehab","score":1},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scared","id":"scared"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/autism","id":"autism"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/autism%20awareness","id":"autism awareness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/autistic","id":"autistic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/needles","id":"needles"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/overwhelmed","id":"overwhelmed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/training","id":"training"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wheelchair","id":"wheelchair"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wheelchairs","id":"Wheelchairs"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unsafe","id":"unsafe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/crying","id":"crying"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vaccine","id":"vaccine"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hpv%20vaccine","id":"hpv vaccine"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/959802","id":"959802"}]},{"id":956720,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Big Thank You","body":"All I can say is this is the best surgery in Witham , my Doctor was very helpful and she listened to everything I needed to talk to her about, which I found brilliant, also booked me my blood test there and then.

I was understandably nervous at the thought of the operation, but felt more relaxed as time passed, as the staff somehow imparted to me confidence in their competence that they would see me through it all. I felt fully informed along the way and cared for with kindness and efficiency at all times from my first appointment. I particularly loved the words of the wonderful consultant anaesthetist, who told me I was part of their team for the time it took for my operation. It was a great way to make me feel special. I enjoyed listening to the banter and camaraderie of the theatre team, whilst they carried out my operation so highly efficiently and was impressed by the way they showed their respect for each other. I also loved the sense of humour of my consultant when he spoke to me before the operation. He made me feel totally confident in his care and I also appreciated that he popped in to see me before I left the hospital the next day. The nursing team were wonderful, physios and Xray staff kind and efficient and everything was very clean. I was very impressed with the amazing food, delivered always with a smile by members of the catering team. The meals would put some restaurants to shame. I have also been impressed by the follow-up phone calls from ward staff and physios since I have been home, always assuring me they are there if I need them. I am grateful as well to the pharmacist, who was so quick to send tablets that had been left out of the pack I brought home with me, and to the Booking team, who are so friendly and efficient. I hope I haven't left anyone out and if I have that they will consider themselves included in my thanks. I also hope my sincere gratitude can be passed on to everyone. I can now bore at length to anyone who will listen about the amazing experience I had due to all concerned and won't hesitate to recommend the Hospital to anyone who is considering where to have their operation.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-07-14T22:01:04","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-07-15T08:35:47","readBy":[{"name":"Shepton Mallet NHS Treatment Centre","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/956731","id":"956731"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/956731/responses","id":"956731"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/956731/healthservices","id":"956731"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/956731/tags","id":"956731"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/ntph1","id":"NTPH1","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nervous","id":"nervous"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20cared%20for","id":"not cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20about","id":"Cared about"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/concerned","id":"concerned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hip","id":"hip"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hip%20replacement","id":"hip replacement"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/included","id":"included"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/informed","id":"informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20good","id":"not good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20impressed","id":"not impressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/operation","id":"operation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20concerned","id":"very concerned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/xray","id":"Xray"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appreciated","id":"appreciated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20for","id":"cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confidence","id":"confidence"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confident","id":"confident"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gratitude","id":"gratitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hope","id":"Hope"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/impressed","id":"impressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/relaxed","id":"relaxed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20grateful","id":"very grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/feel%20special","id":"feel special"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doing%20well","id":"doing well"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/loved","id":"loved"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/no%20confidence","id":"no confidence"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/no%20hope","id":"no hope"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20great","id":"not great"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/990491","id":"990491"}]},{"id":956070,"author":"Matdw53","authorRoleId":8,"authorRole":"a staff member posting for a patient/service user","title":"Care is impressive","body":"My care has been very impressive in the hospital and I have been very happy with the care I have received.

At this point two years ago I could not envisage being in a position where I had been sober long enough that I could even entertain the idea of getting a job. Even following 18 months of being sober with a volunteer role, I was apprehensive to search for jobs due to previously the disappointment and anxiety being a catalyst for my alcohol use.  \r\nHowever, through the IPS service and the support of my advisor Shamuil I felt confident enough to start applying for jobs. This was due to him treating me like a human being and being able to speak to me with more compassion rather than treating me just as a target to get into work. Their support was instrumental when facing rejection to see positives and learning opportunities rather than succumbing to feelings of inadequacy.

Maybe not everything is relevant, but you can take something from the sessions.  \r\nNot sure that I can state the names of the Team, however I will as they fully deserve credit.  \r\nEllie, Keeley, Tracy and Amaani and Esme.  \r\nRegards and many thanks in getting me back on track.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-07-13T17:40:21.7","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-07-15T10:41:05.827","readBy":[{"name":"Midlands Partnership NHS Foundation Trust","count":6}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/956180","id":"956180"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/956180/responses","id":"956180"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/956180/healthservices","id":"956180"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/956180/tags","id":"956180"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rrex4-inclusion-thurrock","id":"rrex4-inclusion-thurrock","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stress","id":"stress"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/iapt","id":"iapt"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/team","id":"team"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/worry","id":"worry"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thankful","id":"Thankful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/long%20covid","id":"long covid"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/956819","id":"956819"}]},{"id":956794,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Usually happy with them but not this time","body":"I’ve been using this practice for years and they’re usually great but since covid it’s not been so great.

I know we can all run late but there is nothing worse than having an appointment with someone who is late and turns up flustered because I mirror that feeling.  \r\nDuring the assessment Sam clearly shown her understanding of mental health as a whole, the services offered within the whole of mental health services not just the community team and most importantly was able to not only understand how I felt but also explain the minds way of working in such a simple but informative way that I felt a relief I’ve never felt before. It felt like she was able to climb into my head see what was going on for me, break it down and explain why all of that was happening and making me feel how I do.  \r\nI’m honestly lost for words with how amazing that assessment was. I got in my car, had a cry and then sat there for 15 minutes just smiling because I felt like for once one person understood how I felt and knew what I needed to help me get to a better place.  \r\nNot one mental health practitioner has ever made me feel so understood, not alone and comforted in 15 years of accessing mental health services, until today.  \r\nI just want to thank Sam for being so amazing and making me feel how I do now. I feel safe and that is such a huge feeling for someone who hasn’t their whole life.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-07-13T17:46:06.1233333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-07-15T10:42:10.347","readBy":[{"name":"Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust","count":12}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/956181","id":"956181"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/956181/responses","id":"956181"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/956181/healthservices","id":"956181"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/956181/tags","id":"956181"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rha06","id":"RHA06","score":4},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/shocked","id":"shocked"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/5%20star","id":"5 Star"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/above%20and%20beyond","id":"above and beyond"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/informed","id":"informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/knowledgeable","id":"knowledgeable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/safe","id":"safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/understanding","id":"understanding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing","id":"amazing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confident","id":"confident"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fantastic","id":"fantastic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happy","id":"happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/open","id":"open"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/relatable","id":"relatable"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/956833","id":"956833"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/957708","id":"957708"}]},{"id":956793,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Great practice ","body":"I know people are quick to complain, however I have always found the bookings quite quick given the circumstances. pre call with the doctor and appointment the next day ","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-07-14T18:30:22","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2022-07-15T10:43:13","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/956793","id":"956793"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/956793/responses","id":"956793"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/956793/healthservices","id":"956793"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/956793/tags","id":"956793"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/k82615","id":"K82615","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"}]},{"id":956792,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"If you don’t want to see a GP it’s good.

The ambulance staff were lovely and very kind to me. I really appreciated this in my time of need. I wasn’t waiting too long in the emergency department after I arrived. As a retired nurse, I am probably a nightmare as a patient, but I must say I am very impressed by the care I received in the department and the staff are all fabulous.  \r\nSince being moved up to the ward I have found that the nurses and doctors have been fantastic, they have been very good and professional. The ward is also very clean and tidy, which makes it hard to lose things, thankfully.  \r\nI haven’t been enjoying the food in the slightest. It is desperate – the menu is very repetitive and tasteless. I know that the ward washrooms are kept separate for infection control reasons but it is quite stupid to think that you can have patients on diuretics and need to go to the bathroom but can’t because the bathroom allocated to that ward is in use – at times like this I have been able to use other bathrooms but I think it would be better if the bathrooms weren’t designated to any one ward. I also think there should be a room for the televisions, so patients who want to watch the tv can and those who don’t can be left in peace to do whatever they please, as the tv can be awfully noisy – especially on Sundays with the football now on. It can also be quite noisy but I know it’s not easy for the nurses to do this.  \r\nOverall my time in Daisy Hill has been very positive, and I’m probably just being very picky due to my nursing background. But the staff are a credit to the hospital and they are all lovely.","criticality":"minimally critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-07-14T12:37:54.18","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-07-15T11:12:41.107","readBy":[{"name":"Northern Ireland ambulance service","count":2},{"name":"Southern Health and Social Care Trust","count":5}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/956467","id":"956467"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/956467/responses","id":"956467"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/956467/healthservices","id":"956467"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/956467/tags","id":"956467"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/nias-emergency","id":"nias-emergency","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_33020-medical-m","id":"ZT003_33020-medical-m","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ambulance%20crew","id":"ambulance crew"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bathroom","id":"bathroom"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctors","id":"doctors"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency","id":"emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/food","id":"food"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/television","id":"television"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/impressive","id":"impressive"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/957359","id":"957359"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/957682","id":"957682"}]},{"id":956474,"author":"Fioew57","authorRoleId":8,"authorRole":"a staff member posting for a patient/service user","title":"Not too bad","body":"The staff in Daisy Hill are simply brilliant.

Not knowing what the process was. A nurse came for me, I picked up my overnight bag and followed them. I found them difficult to understand, asking a serious of questions. They took me back to Waiting area, told me to change. Fortunately I didn't as it was another 3 hrs before operation. Anesthetist came, picked up bag moved to another room. Good explanation of process, explained 3 hr dealy. Back to Waiting room. Theatre nurse came for me. Got changed, picked up bag and lengthy walk. After about 10 minutes the Anesthetist came, more questions, marked knee. Then surgeon came, more questions. They suddenly realised I hadn't signed consent papers. Got that sorted, lifted bag and walked to prep room. Chaos. Calm Anesthetist, slightly overwrought nurse and I found the other nurse to be inadequate. This was stressful for me as patient, whilst staff have to learn, they were making a dreadful job of asking me questions from the form. They also frequently interrupted the other nurse. Anesthetist did their job. Another theatre nurse appeared - they seemed to be on a mission. Tourniquet on thigh, then started telling me I was resisting them - I couldn't feel my legs so there was no way this was the case. Really stressful. After op, recovery ward was relatively good. Moved to Day Care Ward. Staff efficient at all levels. Food dreadful. A Physio had me out of bed to walk. Didn't have any feeling in my foot so it was exceptionally difficult to put foot down on floor. They were impatient with me. I was sick and they huffed about that. A combination of anesthetic, medication and low blood pressure. They arranged for 2 of their colleagues to see me the following day. In the meantime I continued to be sick and still had very little feeling in my foot. Nurses and other ward staff provided a good level of support. Pain relief changed to try and reduce sickness. Consultant came and provided reassurance about my foot. The next day, 2 physio assistants came. Exercises, quickly done, felt dreadful. Stand up, use frame walk over to door, lightheaded and sweating, needing to stop. They were reluctant to let me sit, however my blood pressure had dropped considerably. They said they would be back. A staff nurse came into see me. Provided much needed support and re-assurance, taking time to talk to me. Pain relief, Coffee and toast courtesy of this person, wonderful. They felt it was unlikely I would be discharged that day. The 2 physios came back in the afternoon. On a mission, walk using sticks to door, into corridor, few yards. Step on and off board step. Back in to room. Sit down. I was then told to get my clothes on and I could go home. Even the staff nurse seemed surprised. It's always great to get home, but I honestly don't think I was ready. The discharge process is long- 3 hours plus, and this was frustrating. The staff nurse was excellent, provided support, ran through discharge process thoroughly even although they were busy with other patients and staff. My biggest concerns were lack of structure and calmness prior to op, and the physios lack of compassion. I found the quality of food to be poor, which must be resulting in waste and lack of nutrition for patient recovery.","criticality":"moderately

Members of the team were on standby in case her situation worsened and injections may have been necessary but this did not prove to be the case. Nurses visited the house and conducted a most professional and empathetic assessment of my wife’s needs regarding equipment like an over-the-bath swivel chair to assist with showering, and frames to assist with using the toilet, and even asked to watch how she coped with getting in and out of bed, and in and out of the car. They were very thorough in their assessment, and kept in telephone contact until they felt she was on an even keel. One unexpected but welcome act was the provision of 10 sets of contact details for other carers and centres where details of experience could be exchanged. We are expecting to be signed off shortly, but have been assured that we need only pick up the phone should anything arise.  \r\nWe could not have asked nor received better support from the team, for which we are both very grateful.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-07-13T19:58:23.75","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-07-15T13:02:59.96","readBy":[{"name":"Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust","count":6}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/956190","id":"956190"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/956190/responses","id":"956190"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/956190/healthservices","id":"956190"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/956190/tags","id":"956190"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rha20-30701","id":"rha20-30701","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/antibiotics","id":"antibiotics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care%20at%20home","id":"care at home"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dementia","id":"dementia"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/family%20support","id":"family support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pneumonia","id":"pneumonia"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vascular%20dementia","id":"vascular dementia"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/empathetic","id":"empathetic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/982917","id":"982917"}]},{"id":956835,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Smokers","body":"Why do we continually have to walk through smokers to get and out of the building?

But everything else has been fine.","criticality":"minimally critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-07-14T14:04:52.6233333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-07-15T13:54:07.913","readBy":[{"name":"Southern Health and Social Care Trust","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/956494","id":"956494"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/956494/responses","id":"956494"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/956494/healthservices","id":"956494"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/956494/tags","id":"956494"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_33020-medical-f","id":"ZT003_33020-medical-f","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/attentive","id":"attentive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctors","id":"doctors"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency","id":"emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/food","id":"food"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/noisy","id":"noisy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting","id":"waiting"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/956991","id":"956991"}]},{"id":956499,"author":"Matdw53","authorRoleId":8,"authorRole":"a staff member posting for a patient/service user","title":"Recovering very well thanks to staff","body":"My care in the hospital has been very good so far and I am must say that I am very happy with the care that I have been receiving in the hospital.
