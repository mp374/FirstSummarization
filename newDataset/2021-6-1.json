We still haven't got a stair lift due to no socket at top of stairs. Council won't fit a socket nor social services so again we're back to square one.  \r\nWe didn't know our social prescriber wasn't permanent and really would have appreciated being more informed. It's very difficult going to work and coming home looking after someone. All w ever asked for is to have some benefits help so I can afford to lessen my hours therefore enabling me to have more time to be a carer. To be honest I feel very let down and still we are no further forward with the stair lift.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-05-28T12:42:19.4133333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-06-01T09:20:01.103","readBy":[{"name":"South Yorkshire Housing Association","count":5}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/850855","id":"850855"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/850855/responses","id":"850855"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/850855/healthservices","id":"850855"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/850855/tags","id":"850855"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/1-101660555-don-social-pre","id":"1-101660555-don-social-pre","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/get%20fit","id":"get fit"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helped","id":"helped"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/social%20services","id":"Social Services"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appreciated","id":"appreciated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20home","id":"at home"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/851213","id":"851213"}]},{"id":851055,"author":"Karl 1","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Great Experience in ED","body":"I attended ED at 2am and was treated with kindness and care.

Zero mention of breastfeeding. Not very inclusive to myself as a breastfeeding mother that no advise was offered.  \r\nIt was down to me to recognise problems with my daughter. When I did, I called my health visitor and to be honest - I felt that they didn't really care. Advised me to visit my GP which was fine but never asked how my child was getting on otherwise. This problem in particular may have been something a health visitor could of picked up as looking back, I can see subtle signs of her condition that I wasn't aware of. I received one follow up phone call from my health visitor a few months later and they had no idea my child had been through 2 surgeries and offered no advice on it. I haven't heard from the health visitor since!  \r\nAs a first time mum, I find the service unacceptable.  \r\nA simple phone call here and there would not go amiss - especially when it comes to the development of a child and the mental wellbeing of a parent!  \r\nHopefully it will improve soon.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-05-19T19:41:53.2166667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-06-01T11:00:08.77","readBy":[{"name":"Belfast Health and Social Care Trust","count":16}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/847921","id":"847921"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/847921/responses","id":"847921"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/847921/healthservices","id":"847921"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/847921/tags","id":"847921"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt001-health-visiting-service","id":"zt001-health-visiting-service","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disappointed","id":"disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/advice","id":"advice"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/health%20visitor","id":"health visitor"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/851290","id":"851290"}]},{"id":850870,"author":"msbpolak","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Super team","body":"I wanted to write to thank the super team who supported me in my recent gynecology appointment. &nbsp; I could not have had a warmer or more supportive appointment. &nbsp; From start to finish the staff on the unit department were kind and welcoming, each and every one of them and once I got into my consultant room the consultant was absolutely brilliant.. super relaxed, informative and upbeat which was exactly what I needed. &nbsp; It's extraordinary to me how the department can keep their spirits up in such challenging times and I will be forever grateful.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-05-28T13:09:39.9066667","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2021-06-01T11:00:09.337","readBy":[{"name":"Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/850870","id":"850870"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/850870/responses","id":"850870"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/850870/healthservices","id":"850870"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/850870/tags","id":"850870"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/ralc7_502","id":"RALC7_502","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/brilliant","id":"brilliant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hysterectomy","id":"hysterectomy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/informative","id":"informative"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kindness","id":"kindness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/team","id":"team"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/welcoming","id":"welcoming"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/relaxed","id":"relaxed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported","id":"supported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"}]},{"id":851131,"author":"J7","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Complacent with newcomers","body":"I feel that some of the staff are complacent with newcomers in the holding cell and presume introduction is not important.

I was incredibly lucky to be seen so quickly and can only hope that others are able to receive the same level of care, especially in an area with such a sensitive nature. &nbsp;","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-05-28T21:00:41.76","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-06-01T13:27:58.283","readBy":[{"name":"Fife Health & Social Care Partnership","count":2},{"name":"NHS Fife","count":6}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/850957","id":"850957"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/850957/responses","id":"850957"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/850957/healthservices","id":"850957"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/850957/tags","id":"850957"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sf9-sexual-health","id":"SF9-Sexual-Health","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/above%20and%20beyond","id":"above and beyond"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appointment","id":"appointment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appointment%20time","id":"appointment time"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/availability","id":"availability"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lucky","id":"lucky"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/patient%20care","id":"patient care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/seen%20quickly","id":"seen quickly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sexual%20health","id":"sexual health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attitude","id":"staff attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/relieved","id":"relieved"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/851530","id":"851530"}]},{"id":850955,"author":"weehoosie","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"The arrival of our daughter","body":"I had a planned c section due to having a placenta previa in February 2021.

I had phoned the Grampian NHS line beforehand, as I am autistic, have ADHD, and a physical disability. That call itself was very long, as the call handler hadn't dealt with anything like my inquiry before. I was told to go to the front of the queue (due to ADHD and physical pain meaning I can't stand and wait), and that there would be the quiet space I requested, as I was driving.  \r\nThe person managing the queue tried to send me to the back of it twice. I had to insist I had been told to go to the front. My sunflower lanyard was visible the whole time. It was only when I pulled on it to emphasise it that they relented. It was humiliating having to pretty much argue with them in front of an extremely long queue.  \r\nInside, a nurse did seem to supervise me, but there was nowhere for me to sit. I was left standing for a few minutes while they worked out what to do with me. Again, skipping the queue made me feel embarrassed. There was no quiet space. I was taken round to a cubicle and the nurse was told that I was 'anxious' which was just so incorrect. No one had bothered to ask me anything.  \r\nThere was no quiet space. I had the option of waiting in the main hall (which I wish I'd done now), or going to what they said was a quiet place. It was a waiting area a door along, and it was not quiet, it was noisy with conversations that were clear and echoed. I was in pain, but also so embarrassed, ashamed, humiliated, uneasy, on edge and frightened. I was still feeling like this after 10 minutes, I wasn't in the least bit comfortable, I didn't feel looked after or supported, there was no one keeping an eye on me or even saying anything nice or reassuring, and the experience was just so unbearably distressing and upsetting I'm really glad it was my second dose. For my first, there was hardly anyone there and my dad drove for me. I wish I'd stayed in the main hall because at least the nurse there seemed really nice and the sounds were all merged together into one distressing mess rather than being a few very sharp, painfully loud conversation.  \r\nThe vaccination centre was way too busy and loud, and there was clearly absolutely no provision in place for autistic people, the staff didn't seem to know what to do with me, and physically I was uncomfortable too with all the standing (it wasn't for long by anyone else's standards, but I have nerve pain in my foot, and sacroiliitis.  \r\nAs a result of how shaken I was, I couldn't drive myself home afterwards. My mother had to drive me home.  \r\nThe whole experience was upsetting and humiliating.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-05-28T18:56:03.7366667","progress":"Story has a

From this team I have been referred onto the team at Futures Positive Individual Placement and Support Employment Services. They played a pivotal role in helping me get back to work after being unemployed for nearly 20 years.  \r\nWith the help of Younis and Sangita's weekly coaching calls I learnt valuable skills which enabled me to sail through my first interview. I not only received support leading up to this interview but also on the day, as Sangita attended it with me. With their support I managed to gain a position within the NHS.  \r\nOnce I started working I still received ongoing support from Younis and Sangita as they checked on a regular basis how I'm coping with my new role. After a few months cleaning on wards and interacting with mental health patients, I realised that I have the ability and desire to understand and help these patients with their issues. I frequently had situations where patients openly discussed their problems and fears with me and that made me feel like I made a difference in some of their lives. I approached Younis about my desire to progress into a role where I can support patients who's suffered with mental issues like myself. Younis has since helped me look for suitable roles in this field and with his support I have now been employed in a role of Health Care Assistant with the option to become a Peer Support Worker.  \r\nI can not express how thankful I am for all the support I have received from both Younis and Sangita and I can truly recommend the services of Futures Positive Individual Placement and Services to anybody who has been unemployed due to mental health issues.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-05-30T19:22:26.9466667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-06-01T16:07:45.43","readBy":[{"name":"Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust","count":15}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/851078","id":"851078"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/851078/responses","id":"851078"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/851078/healthservices","id":"851078"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/851078/tags","id":"851078"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rha-ips-futures-positive","id":"rha-ips-futures-positive","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rha-millbrook","id":"RHA-millbrook","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helped","id":"helped"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/new%20skills","id":"New skills"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/positive","id":"positive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported","id":"supported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thankful","id":"Thankful"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/851272","id":"851272"}]},{"id":851215,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Good, all round support","body":"Wanted to thank the practice for the continuing support I am receiving regarding a complex,  difficult to cope with condition.

This was cancelled and rightly so and I was told that Ward GC had been turned into the Covid 24 hour admission screening ward. My Surgeon was very honest about the situation and appeared as equally frustrated as I am even a year later when he informed me that things were still no further on. This complaint is in no way aimed at the clinical team and more at management.  \r\nCan you tell me what provisions NHS Highland are putting in place with regards to remobilization of all days case surgeries and when this ward will go back to being a surgical ward to allow day case surgeries to resume? Is the hospital management looking at relocating the Covid ward to another part of the hospital or using another ward for day case procedures now that other hospitals have resumed day case surgeries again? I believe the new Elective Treatment Centre currently under construction at the UHI Campus is being built to focus on Orthopedics and Eyes procedures so what will happen for other specialties?

I was then advised that the GP surgery would need to take blood samples from me to run some more tests. However, when I was handed the paperwork related to this blood test by the nurse, I noticed that there was a large yellow sticker on it which said ‘DANGER OF INFECTION’, on top of which the nurse was going to write ‘HIV positive’. I asked why they needed to do this and was told it was so the nurse taking my blood would be aware that they should be careful with my blood.  \r\nAs you can imagine, this was very upsetting for me – this is very stigmatising behaviour on the part of my GP surgery and shows a lack of understanding of HIV, and of how to work with people living with HIV. I was so upset that I didn’t go through with giving a blood test and considered disengaging from NHS services altogether, including for my HIV care, because I was so shocked that I had been treated this way. I feel my GP surgery needs to receive training on working with people living with HIV so that they stop this practice immediately, and no one else is made to feel like I felt that day.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-06-02T13:03:11.6766667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-06-02T13:11:08.033","readBy":[{"name":"Ulster University, MBBS (Medicine) 2021","count":1},{"name":"NHS Lanarkshire","count":1},{"name":"Lanarkshire Links","count":1},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2021)","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/851319","id":"851319"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/851319/responses","id":"851319"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/851319/healthservices","id":"851319"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/851319/tags","id":"851319"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sl9-gp","id":"sl9-gp","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/shocked","id":"shocked"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20upset","id":"very upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood","id":"blood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20test","id":"blood test"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/concerned","id":"concerned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diabetic","id":"diabetic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hiv","id":"hiv"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/infection","id":"infection"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stigmatised","id":"stigmatised"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hiv%20training%20for%20all%20staff","id":"hiv training for all staff"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/851456","id":"851456"}]},{"id":851318,"author":"Pedro300","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Myself and my alcohol addiction","body":"After many years of ucing alcohol as a coping mechinisim I have recently sought help with CGL at Wisbech prior to this I was unaware of their existance of CGL.

I felt that Katrina really cares for you and even though my sessions all took place over the phone, it was all still very personal to me and was helped along by Katrina's calm and caring personality.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-06-02T11:21:22.9733333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-06-02T13:18:38.297","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lanarkshire","count":4},{"name":"North Lanarkshire Health & Social Care Partnership","count":1},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2021)","count":1},{"name":"Partnership for Change","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/851304","id":"851304"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/851304/responses","id":"851304"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/851304/healthservices","id":"851304"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/851304/tags","id":"851304"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sl9-occupational-therapy","id":"SL9-occupational-therapy","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fibromyalgia","id":"fibromyalgia"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/information","id":"information"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/occupational%20therapist","id":"occupational therapist"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ot","id":"ot"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/personalised","id":"personalised"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/851326","id":"851326"}]},{"id":851303,"author":"funnycp85","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Yoga session","body":"It was a lovely session, I was able to keep up so that made me feel good, as I haven't done much yoga for the past two years.\r\nMade me feel better for the rest of the day, looking forward to the next session.\r\nThank you Jennie and everyone who helped organise.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-06-02T11:14:00.8966667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-06-02T13:24:11.203","readBy":[{"name":"Royal Devon University Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust","count":5}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/851303","id":"851303"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/851303/responses","id":"851303"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/851303/healthservices","id":"851303"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/851303/tags","id":"851303"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rbz12-oncology","id":"rbz12-oncology","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/yoga","id":"yoga"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/851328","id":"851328"}]},{"id":850959,"author":"Annyd37","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Breast Cancer Service","body":"I attended an appointment today at the Breast clinic and I feel we are privileged to have access to such a service.

Ringing them seems pointless as the telephone just rings out until it is cut off.  \r\nI feel that discharging patients when able should be paramount to their workload?","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-05-28T16:30:01.84","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-06-02T14:17:10.93","readBy":[{"name":"Ulster University, MBBS (Medicine) 2021","count":1},{"name":"University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/850936","id":"850936"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/850936/responses","id":"850936"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/850936/healthservices","id":"850936"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/850936/tags","id":"850936"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rrk97_430","id":"RRK97_430","score":1},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/answering%20phones","id":"answering phones"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/discharge%20process","id":"Discharge process"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/discharge%20wait","id":"Discharge wait"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/elderly","id":"elderly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/elderly%20patient","id":"elderly patient"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pointless","id":"pointless"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/851604","id":"851604"}]},{"id":851028,"author":"Ebony19","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Brain Surgery","body":"I have recently had a large olfactory meningioma removed and I am recovering well.  \r\nI can’t praise The Walton Centre enough .  \r\nSurgery was cancelled from January due to Covid which resulted in me having a major seizure which unfortunately I was in hospital for a few days and eventually had my operation in May.

I recently had the misfortune to fall ill while on holiday in Cornwall. I would not wish others to suffer as I did.  \r\nOne Tuesday last month at about 8.30 pm I experienced a sudden and extreme abdominal pain. I could not account for this but decided to go and lie down and hope that it passed. I was then violently sick at regular intervals and in extreme pain so I called an ambulance at 3.30 am.  \r\nThe ambulance took me to Treliske Hospital where I was examined several times and BP and pulse, etc, checked. My abdomen by this time was hugely extended and very painful. Doctors listened to my abdomen several times.  \r\nAfter a very uncomfortable night (made bearable by morphine) a doctor came and said that I had Gastritis. A short while later another doctor came and examined me again, including listening to my abdomen. They said that I had a gastric ulcer. They told me to go home and avoid alcohol, fizzy drinks, chocolate and spicy food. To take Gaviscon and painkillers and when I returned home from my holiday to consult my GP about a Gastroscopy.  \r\nMy son fetched me home and I followed this advice from Wednesday until Friday. I was extremely nauseous, in considerable pain and ate absolutely nothing. I spent most of my time in bed.  \r\nOn Friday I ate a small piece of toast and was immediately sick. I called 111 and was given an appointment at Bodmin Hospital for 9am Saturday morning. I attended this appointment where again I was examined and my abdomen was listened to and declared to be working. No notice was taken of the fact that I said I had not had any motion of the bowel in five days.  \r\nBy this time my son was so worried that he insisted that we return home which we did. On Sunday I had to call another ambulance and was taken into Worcester Royal Hospital. Here I was properly examined, x-rayed, scanned and declared to have a bowel blockage and be in urgent need of surgery.  \r\nThe consultant surgeon, Mr Wadley, who added me to the end of his already very full operating list on the following Tuesday told me the next morning that my gut was twisted, totally blocked, dead and gangrenous. He said he was glad he had added me on because by morning I would have had peritonitis within ten hours, followed by death. I have since been making a slow recovery.  \r\nMy major complaint is that nobody gave a correct diagnosis. Nobody told me that time was of the essence and I needed to get rapid proper attention.  \r\nI understand that this condition is fairly common. I am concerned that patients who present at Treliske or Bodmin with the same symptoms could be given the same misdiagnosis.","criticality":"strongly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-05-28T18:11:33.5866667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-06-02T14:21:31.867","readBy":[{"name":"Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust","count":2},{"name":"Plymouth University Health and Human Sciences students, 2018","count":2},{"name":"Royal Cornwall Hospitals NHS Trust","count":12},{"name":"Cornwall Partnership NHS Foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/850946","id":"850946"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/850946/responses","id":"850946"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/850946/healthservices","id":"850946"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/850946/tags","id":"850946"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/ref12_300","id":"REF12_300","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rj866","id":"RJ866","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rwp50_180","id":"RWP50_180","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rwp50_301","id":"RWP50_301","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20being%20listened%20to","id":"not being listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20listened%20to","id":"not listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20listening","id":"not listening"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/worried","id":"worried"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/abdominal","id":"abdominal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/alcohol","id":"alcohol"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ambulance%20crew","id":"ambulance crew"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bowel","id":"bowel"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/concerned","id":"concerned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/death","id":"death"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diagnosis","id":"diagnosis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/die","id":"die"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fall","id":"fall"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gastric","id":"gastric"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gastroscopy","id":"gastroscopy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/glad","id":"glad"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/painkillers","id":"painkillers"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/uncomfortable","id":"uncomfortable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20concerned","id":"very concerned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hope","id":"Hope"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20worried","id":"not worried"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/no%20hope","id":"no hope"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/listened%20to","id":"listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20home","id":"at home"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/851337","id":"851337"}]},{"id":851043,"author":"Aziz KH","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Helped my Anxiety","body":"I experienced severe anxiety/panic attack back in December.

Nurse was very helpful and pleasant to talk to.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-05-29T14:44:15.8633333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-06-02T14:27:20.11","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Fife","count":6},{"name":"Fife Health & Social Care Partnership","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/851050","id":"851050"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/851050/responses","id":"851050"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/851050/healthservices","id":"851050"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/851050/tags","id":"851050"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sf9-community-services-diabetes","id":"sf9-community-services-diabetes","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diabetes","id":"diabetes"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dietician","id":"Dietician"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/easy%20to%20talk%20to","id":"easy to talk to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helpful","id":"helpful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurse","id":"nurse"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/phone%20call","id":"phone call"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pleasant","id":"pleasant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pleasant%20staff","id":"pleasant staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/referral","id":"referral"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surprised","id":"surprised"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting%20time","id":"waiting time"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/impressed","id":"impressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/explanations","id":"explanations"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/speed%20of%20call%20back","id":"Speed of call back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/easy%20to%20understand","id":"easy to understand"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/852033","id":"852033"}]},{"id":851335,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Impossible to contact; unhelpful on urgent issues","body":"I needed an urgent prescription.

I had not been walking due to the level of pain I was under this day , and was advised I would be starting the next day. So through the night I was assisted to the ladies using a wheeled commode , and I used my walker for help as I was given this for transferring only not walking at this time. I had a night shift staff member assist me but they did not show as much empathy as the others.  \r\nMyself I have work in the care sector for 16 years but the past 3 I have worked in rehabilitation so I had the understanding of what happened.  \r\nSo after I went to the toilet, where I was left to try and help myself, I was then taken back to my bed , where I pushed through my pain levels to get back into the bed. this nurse took to chair away and then walked away, I was left to wash my hands with a wipe and to get my legs back into bed myself. I did not have a good sleep as there was other people in pain which I was fully understand. I just feel that this nurse was not the most helpful person, for me that night . Once I was in bed then the curtains was closed.  \r\nToday when I felt I spoke to a lovely staff member that was in the day of my operation and she said I looked much better than the day of my operation, I explained what I felt and I was then given this card and I explained to the staff member I worked in the care sector, and she said so you know what to expect.  \r\nOut off all the staff it was that one I did not feel comfortable with. I got the feeling it was like lets get the job done quick .  \r\nThe physios were also amazing towards me and the Drs also, Dr cook was lovely towards me after my operation he even came up after his last operation to make sure my pain level was under control as it took about 4 hours to settle this. The anps were also amazing with my care, can't thank them enough.  \r\nBut over all I only had the 1 thing wrong.

He loved the food so much that we called his stay in the ward, his Spa retreat.  \r\nSadly and after a very brave battle, Tommy, my Dad, my mentor, my friend and wonderful husband to my Mum, fantastic father in law to my wife, and legendary Granda to our children, passed away on Friday 28th May 2021.  \r\nOn behalf of my Father and our family I just want to express my sincere gratitude to everyone who cared for him, from the cleaning and catering staff to the nurses and doctors who treated him with dignity and respect throughout his illness.  \r\nI will always be indebted to you for looking after such a special person in my life and I am comforted knowing that he passed away with us at his bedside, fully aware of how much he meant to us and how loved he was.  \r\nThank you all for taking care of him and for allowing us to visit when we needed to, without exception. The staff we encountered in Ward 3B of the Ulster Hospital are legendary, just like my Dad and the family thank you for everything you all did.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-05-30T07:18:13.19","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-06-02T15:02:54.403","readBy":[{"name":"South Eastern Health and Social Care Trust","count":11}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/851065","id":"851065"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/851065/responses","id":"851065"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/851065/healthservices","id":"851065"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/851065/tags","id":"851065"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt004_07021_340","id":"ZT004_07021_340","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt004_07021-3b","id":"zt004_07021-3b","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/antibiotics","id":"antibiotics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/attention","id":"attention"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20about","id":"Cared about"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/caring%20staff","id":"caring staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/comforted","id":"comforted"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/did","id":"DID"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/facilities","id":"facilities"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fight","id":"fight"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/food","id":"food"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/indebted","id":"indebted"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/infection","id":"infection"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lungs","id":"lungs"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/oxygen","id":"oxygen"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/passed%20away","id":"passed away"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pneumonia","id":"pneumonia"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/respect","id":"respect"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/visiting%20time","id":"visiting time"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20for","id":"cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dignity","id":"Dignity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fantastic","id":"fantastic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gratitude","id":"gratitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thankful","id":"Thankful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wonderful","id":"wonderful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/loved","id":"loved"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/brave","id":"brave"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/shortness%20of%20breath","id":"shortness of breath"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/853082","id":"853082"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/853095","id":"853095"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/853107","id":"853107"}]},{"id":851066,"author":"CountryGirl92","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Vaccine & Needle Phobia","body":"Every single member of staff guided me every step of the way, constantly reassured me and never rushed me- even when I was in floods of irrational tears.

They have looked after mum with care and compassion, they have listened to what we had to say about mum's care and her ongoing health issues and the team kept us informed at all times as to what they thought were appropriate interventions.  \r\nAs well as dealing with mum's immediate health issues the Hospital at Home Team also took the time to consider and review mum's ongoing care. Again they listened to her family, discussed historical health issues and put in place actions for mum's future care.  \r\nAlthough we are always anxious when mum is unwell we were always reassured when Hospital at Home are involved in her care.  \r\nThank you Hospital at Home Team!  \r\nIn my opinion Hospital at Home is a service that should be made more widely available across the NHS. Skilled professionals working in a small, dynamic team can only enhance the care system. The service allows patients the opportunity to be in their own home, hopefully with their loved ones, reducing some of the stress and anxiety while being acutely ill.  \r\n","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-05-30T17:38:50.8","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-06-02T15:13:53.403","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lothian","count":6}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/851076","id":"851076"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/851076/responses","id":"851076"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/851076/healthservices","id":"851076"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/851076/tags","id":"851076"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/s9-midlothian-hath","id":"s9-midlothian-hath","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/alzheimers","id":"alzheimers"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/attentive","id":"attentive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/caring","id":"caring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/elderly","id":"elderly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/heart%20disease","id":"heart disease"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/informed","id":"informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/osteoarthritis","id":"osteoarthritis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/osteoporosis","id":"osteoporosis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professional","id":"professional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/skilled%20staff","id":"skilled staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassion","id":"compassion"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassionate","id":"compassionate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/listened%20to","id":"listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20home","id":"at home"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/851362","id":"851362"}]},{"id":851223,"author":"izarbp73","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Coil fitting","body":"Very well looked after, Dr Kundu and the nurse made me feel at ease and I had nothing to worry about.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-06-01T20:16:17.8533333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-06-02T15:14:44.71","readBy":[{"name":"Midlands Partnership NHS Foundation Trust","count":5}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/851223","id":"851223"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/851223/responses","id":"851223"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/851223/healthservices","id":"851223"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/851223/tags","id":"851223"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rrex4-sexual-health-services-tw","id":"rrex4-sexual-health-services-tw","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/contraception","id":"contraception"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctor","id":"doctor"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurse","id":"nurse"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/coil%20fitting","id":"coil fitting"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/less%20worried","id":"less worried"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20at%20ease","id":"put at ease"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/852259","id":"852259"}]},{"id":851179,"author":"Ryusan12","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"STI check up","body":"Spoke to a nurse and got tested for STIs.

The staff were amazing and so friendly and absolutely brilliant with kids. Special thank you to Lyndsay, Kim, Rachel, Michael and Alana. They really know how to put kids at ease. Michael the anesthetist was brilliant and chatted away to him and made him laugh just before he was put to sleep. We had a lovely private room in ward 3c and it felt like a hotel. We got brought a lovely lunch (the best homemade soup) and dinner, which was unexpected, and we kept getting asked if we wanted a tea or coffee. My son was desperate for cereal after his surgery at 2.30pm and they brought it happily. The room was immaculate and cleaned constantly. We were given an aftercare plan and Alana talked through it all clearly before we left and she was happy to answer any questions.  \r\nMy son said it was such a fun hospital and even said it was awesome 🥰.

I cannot thank the staff enough, the receptionists who got to know my face, the porters for wheeling me down to the ward and the many nurses and doctors who, apart from doing their own tasks, took time out to speak to me and to help me understand what was happening.  \r\nMy husband was very ill and I believe he had been given CPR several times. I am now waiting to find out when he is going to the High Dependancy Unit.

Unfortunately my eating disorder spiralled really very quickly and I was hospitalised in July 2018 as I became very unwell. The team at Barnsley Hospital recognised I needed inpatient support and were able to get me an inpatient bed at Riverdale Grange.  \r\nEating disorders are so misunderstood. Nothing frustrates me more than the DSM-5 criteria as I was struggling with anorexia and disordered eating way before my BMI dropped to a dangerously low level. I was rejected by my GP on several occasions for treatment, and not considered a priority for referral to psychiatric services as my behaviours weren’t considered destructive enough. So naturally I put myself on a warpath after that to prove I was sick enough to deserve treatment. Still I am very grateful for the ANP at my surgery who was quick to admit me after a routine check up - they showed the most understanding of anyone to that point, let me cry it out in the surgery with them and then helped me into a taxi to Barnsley Hospital.  \r\nI am thrilled to say I am now in a very good place with my eating disorder which must be attributed to the efforts of the staff at Riverdale Grange and my own determination.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-05-24T22:23:57.52","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-06-02T16:14:20.587","readBy":[{"name":"BPP University, BSc Nursing (Adult) 2019-03","count":1},{"name":"BPP University, School of Nursing","count":1},{"name":"Barnsley Hospital NHS Foundation Trust","count":1},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2021)","count":3},{"name":"Riverdale Grange","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/849413","id":"849413"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/849413/responses","id":"849413"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/849413/healthservices","id":"849413"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/849413/tags","id":"849413"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/1-107111672","id":"1-107111672","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/gps-barnsley","id":"gps-barnsley","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rffaa","id":"RFFAA","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anorexia","id":"anorexia"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bmi","id":"BMI"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/determined","id":"determined"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/eating%20disorder","id":"eating disorder"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/effort","id":"effort"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/encouraging","id":"encouraging"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good","id":"good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helped","id":"helped"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/injury","id":"injury"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/inpatient%20care","id":"inpatient care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/misunderstood","id":"misunderstood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/psychiatric","id":"psychiatric"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/recognition","id":"recognition"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/rejected","id":"Rejected"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/setting","id":"setting"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20support","id":"Staff support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/therapeutic","id":"therapeutic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/understanding","id":"understanding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/empowering","id":"empowering"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/quick%20admission","id":"quick admission"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/advanced%20nurse%20practitioner","id":"advanced nurse practitioner"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/referrals","id":"referrals"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/therapeutic%20setting","id":"therapeutic setting"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/851846","id":"851846"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/852989","id":"852989"}]},{"id":851365,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Great experiences","body":"Can't fault the experiences I've had since moving to this doctors.

It was a very \"cold\", matter of fact experience and I didn't feel very supported or cared for at all going through one of the hardest things in my life. I wasn't given any leaflets or information and had no follow up.  \r\nWhen I asked if I would get early scans if I was pregnant again the midwives said that the Consultant is quite strict and that unless I had had recurrent miscarriages or was in pain and bleeding they wouldn't be allowed to see me early in a new pregnancy. I was very upset at this. It felt so dismissive and lacking in compassion, especially when I had just lost my baby. I naturally thought I'd get more appointments and scans next time.  \r\nEPU staff in the Belfast Trust don't seem to have a good understanding of what their patients who miscarry are going through. I wasn't even offered a chat with the bereavement midwife in the Trust- who is this service there for then?  \r\nThe Belfast Trust really need to look at how they treat people who have miscarriages. I was very upset at the attitude and lack of emotional care. You really wouldn't have thought I had lost a baby the way they got on. I know miscarriage is common and they see it every day but it is still really upsetting and that was my baby. I have read about people having a better experience in some other hospitals. The Royal Maternity miscarriage bit need to make big changes- I was shocked because I'd had a baby there before and the way I was treated was good.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-05-31T01:08:12.86","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-06-03T10:12:22.177","readBy":[{"name":"Belfast Health and Social Care Trust","count":15},{"name":"Patient and Client Council","count":1},{"name":"Public Health Agency","count":1},{"name":"Ulster University, Faculty of Life and Health Sciences","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/851083","id":"851083"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/851083/responses","id":"851083"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/851083/healthservices","id":"851083"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/851083/tags","id":"851083"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt001_11022","id":"ZT001_11022","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/answering%20phones","id":"answering phones"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dismissed","id":"dismissed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emotional%20support","id":"emotional support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/follow%20up","id":"follow up"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good","id":"good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/information","id":"information"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/miscarriage","id":"miscarriage"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/previous%20experience","id":"previous experience"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attitude","id":"staff attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassion","id":"compassion"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/trust","id":"Trust"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/851896","id":"851896"}]}]
