The Maxfax department gave me a detailed description of the procedure they were going to do. They realigned my tooth and put in a splint to hold it in place.

This had been my experience when a similar thing happened in April, therefore, I was not to worried as care was quick and seamless, However, this time my admission via A&E can only be described as awful-degrading- absent care, lacking empathy-With questionable systems being followed in terms of medication.Due to previous sepsis I got to the hospital quickly (2am) and had been informed by staff in 214 they knew of my pending arrivalThe receptionist was abrupt in manner, almost huffy in response to my explanation that I had been advised to attend by ward staff, and there was no warmth or compassion shown whilst taking details And shown where to sit . Waited about 20 mins to be seen. I had a positive experience with the intake nurse; smiley, empathetic and quick to undertake all the necessary checks and see me through to a bayNursing bay - student nurse and a nurse, they also demonstrated positive And empathetic care albeit it with obvious pressures as I was Left for periods of time whilst they went to go and get equipment etc with no buzzer etc however they spoke me through what was to happen performed ecg and on seeing my Obs and knowing I was hard to take blood from it was then my care became “doctor led”.It was in this time, in the main A&E bays that, I experienced the worst care I have to date, truly awful and on reflection traumatising.I would describe myself as a very patient person who gives my trust to the experts, I am aware of the pressures and challenged for staff in this department and empathetic to this however that same empathy and respect was not shown to me.The doctor assigned to my care, had treated me previously which worried me as they were not empathetic at that time. After brief introduction, began attempting to take blood and whilst recognising my veins can be difficult particularly when so unwell. it is not an exaggeration to suggest this doctor must have inserted at least 20 needles into various parts of my arms/ hands including using a ultrasound machine, with no success. These attempts were frequently broken up by attending to other matters in bays around us and frequent disruptions from nursing staff coming to talk about other patients by name in front of me. Each failed attempt appears to cause the doctor to become less patient and left me feeling I was to blame and I was told on numerous occasions they could \"only do as best as they can\" and that they would keep going until a vein was found.I had to request several breaks as it was clear this doctor appeared to have something to prove, as it is my experience following so many unsuccessful attempts to cannulate or get blood other people would try, this was not my experience here and my request for this to happen was met with passive aggression and an implication this could only be done by them.When a canula was finally in, they commented that it was the most precarious cannula in their life but ordered fluids to be put up, by this time I Had been in a&e receiving this “treatment” for about 2 hours, thereafter at least four nurses came near my bed and I asked several times about fluids but that took at least an hour and when they started the precarious cannula wasn’t even in a vein. Again after more attempts another cannula went in and on flushing I could immediately feel it was sore however the doctor appeared not to hear this and went off.Again lots of nurses around and no communication with me having to enquire on several occasions if I was still getting fluids or antibiotics. At least an hour passed (all whilst I was very poorly) and a nurse came to administer antibiotics all whilst talking to other nurses and never checking on my general well-being. Again the cannula was not correctly in, causing pain, but allegedly did flush. The nurse went to discuss my pain with the doctor and never came back nor did I see the dr again. To my surprise shortly after this a different nurse came into my bay in abrupt manner with a tone implying I was refusing the medication, which I had been waiting for over an hour to be put up and making comments that “it was for my own good and what do I suppose they do” and despite the pain told me that the cannula was in and was informed me that it was for my own good that I try it and see how I go. I agree to this, mainly due to the fact I was exhausted felt bullied and humiliated as though I was wasting their time and the antibiotic was hooked up, I had instant pain in my arm and was advised, despite letting them know this, they would leave it for a few minutes and “see how I went”. The pain was excruciating and I had to scream out for a passing nurse who seeing my distress stopped it promptly. By this point my veins had already tissued and in agony, again an apparent inconvenience.During the above horrific experience I was asked several times by doctors and nurses what I expected them to do. I was unwell and feeling very vulnerable and the only solution I had was to admit me to ward 214 who are familiar with my care, I was concerned about the delay of treatment in A&E due to the busyness of staff, no consistent person overseeing my care, a doctor and nurse whose attitude has been very degrading and uncaring And essentially being left to continually ask about any fluids and antibiotics whilst feeling so poorly.As noted above the nurses and doctor appeared to think this was not possible until they had “ticked” all there to do list even though it was clear this was not going to be possible. The ward phoned down several times to enquire about me and luckily this appeared to bring my time in A&E to a quicker end.To finish the horrific experience the porter arrived to collect me and a further 20 min wait ensued the nurse who did attend with me yawned and moaned about their shift to the porter all the way up and on arrival on ward said they were unsure about my circumstances as had been too busy to know what had been happening, luckily this is not my first experience and I was able to answer some of the questions.Anyway, having arrived at 2am they finally appeared to relent to me going to my ward at 6.45 I feel that was almost 5 hours of wasted time for my care which I stayed in hospital for a week to recover. My experience in ward 214 was so different where I was met with consistent compassion and a cannula nurse attended promptly and inserted a cannula successfully in the first occasion and a huge contrast in care.Therefore to summarise the above, which are example of my experience- My care did not appear to follow protocol in terms of the administration of medication and cannulating- Bar two of the nursing staff, each member whom I had interactions with in A&E, briefly and inconsistently were abrupt, ineffective, dismissive and definitely not patient-centred. In particular the nurse who administered the antibiotics into my vein did so despite knowing the pain and this could have had more significant consequences if I was unable to alert staff.- the doctor leading my care showed these qualities too, and appeared to be stretched between so many patients that nothing was actioned promptly, consistently, or with any care, empathy or patients centredness. -There appeared a lot of hustle and bustle with nurses and doctors moving around but no consistency in my care, despite there being a clear plan for me to go to ward upon confirmation admission was needed which was clear in the first consultation room. On the two occasions I did enquire, this appeared to aggravate the doctor who felt this was undermining their abilities and it was quite the opposite.- there was no communication about timescales or next steps, huge delays from the decision to give fluids/ antibiotics for any attempt for these to be administered- finally and ironically, despite coming via A&E as part of the COVID screening process having spiked a sudden temperature, at no time was I asked about any other potential Covid symptoms or swabbed for this which I found quite baffling and I had to alert staff to this on ward in case it changes my care pattern.I did enquire about the name of the doctor the following day but this never came to fruition as if I had this I would also consider following a formal complaint process as I do not want myself or any other person to go through what I went through during this A&E admission when I know care and standards have been higher previously and this experience impacted on my overall well-being and emotional recovery.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-08-30T02:45:10.32","progress":"Story has a

The worst thing about the colonoscopy is the bowel preparation. I've gone through this a few times now, always with a morning appointment in the past.

Don't believe the guidance allow 2 hours between taking the solution and your appointment, leave 4 hours. Other than that, it's not too bad. I didn't have sedation or gas and air on any of the occasions. Once in the past I had a surgeon who I felt was a bit heavy-handed, but still nothing that I couldn't cope with. This time the surgeon was very gentle and I hardly felt a thing. The nursing staff were great, as was the reception.  \r\nI had a CT scan, with contrast. This involves the injection of a contrast dye just prior to the scan. All I felt was a hot flush and the it was over. All the staff were great.  \r\nNext was the gastroscopy.

I left a full and considered report on my experience. You can imagine my feelings when, as I submitted my report, something went wrong. I lost the report and had to start again. I decided to wait until I had calmed down. Here is a synopsis of my experience. It is intended to be taken as a guide to improving people's experience.  \r\nI have had gastroscpies in the past, and while one would not opt for one, they have not caused pain. My experience this time was much different.  \r\nThe reception staff were pleasant, although the appointment system needs improving. I was not seen until 1 hour and 15 minutes after my allotted time for booking in, then not called through for the procedure for another hour.  \r\nWhile in the waiting room, there was a man using a handkerchief as a mask, but tied in such a way that it only covered his mouth. Another patient had a mask on, but had it pulled down, again only covering his mouth. Another patient had reacted adversely to part of a procedure and was in the waiting area, no mask, coughing and sneezing.  \r\nWhen I was finally called through, the procedure was to be performed via my nose, not straight down my throat. I was told that this reduces aerosol formation. I have a science background and cannot see how using the nasal route results unless aerosol production!  \r\nThe nursing staff were great. It was the doctor that I take issue with. First, the doctor wanted to spray local anaesthetic in my nose. This came in a pack and had to be assembled. part of it was dropped but they continued to assemble it, then turned round and rammed it up my nose. It was a painful experience.  \r\nAfter a couple of minutes for the anaesthetic to take effect, the endoscope was brought over and the medic started to push it up my nose. The anaesthetic deadened the feeling, but did not lessen the sensation of the scope being banged repeatedly against the back of my nose. It also felt scratchy as it were down my gullet. Once in the stomac, it was much better, except for the banging against the back of my nose. The scope was passed into my duodenum and 4 samples were taken, then the scope was removed. I was much relieved. I thanked the staff and was later discharged.  \r\nThe feeling that my oesophagus had been scratched and made swallowing uncomfortable lasted for a few days. My nose was sore for several days, feeling as though I had been hit.  \r\nIf I have to have another, I will be insisting on the oral route.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-08-29T07:44:53.5933333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-09-01T09:51:11.837","readBy":[{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2020)","count":1},{"name":"York and Scarborough Teaching Hospital NHS Foundation Trust","count":1},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2021)","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/783465","id":"783465"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/783465/responses","id":"783465"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/783465/healthservices","id":"783465"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/783465/tags","id":"783465"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/careopinion","id":"careopinion","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rcb55_301","id":"RCB55_301","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anaesthetic","id":"Anaesthetic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appointment%20system","id":"appointment system"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctor","id":"doctor"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gastroscopy","id":"gastroscopy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gullet","id":"gullet"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nasal","id":"nasal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nose","id":"nose"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nursing%20staff","id":"nursing staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/oral","id":"oral"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/patient%20choice","id":"patient choice"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/receptionists","id":"receptionists"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/swallowing","id":"swallowing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/throat","id":"throat"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/time%20wasted","id":"time wasted"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/uncomfortable","id":"uncomfortable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/explanations","id":"explanations"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/painful%20procedure","id":"painful procedure"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mask%20enforcement","id":"mask enforcement"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/785661","id":"785661"}]},{"id":783755,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Excellent practice, great doctors","body":"I have been registered with West hampstead medical centre for over 15 years.

I was in ward 4 for 3 nights, I struggle to sleep so I was up all night one night and the nurses didn’t mind me being up speaking to them, the night shift staff were great. The day shift staff were just as good, everyday I was hoping to get home but I had bladder retention so I was trying to fib to the nurses that I had gone to the toilet so I would get home but they explained how dangerous it would be if my bladder ruptured. They didn’t believe that I had went and joked about it. I couldn’t of asked for better nurses and the doctor that was looking after me while I was in their care. The nurses were really understanding and caring and passionate about the care they gave. Just a special shout out to Natalie and the nightshift team that had to put up with me when I couldn’t sleep, ( I can be rather annoying) but they were just amazing. Thank you!

He phoned the Helensburgh Medical Centre and was given an appointment. They said they’d be very surprised if there was a foreign body in the wound, suggested he may of lay on it in bed causing the pain and gave him some cream to apply. He was told if there was no improvement by the weekend to go to the vale of Leven hospital to get an X-ray. (This would have been four days later)  \r\nFortunately my son wasn’t happy with this diagnosis and as the pain continued we took him to VOL hospital who promptly sent him to RAH. Turns out my son had a very bad infection in the Tendon Sheath which required him to be on a drip for days and go under general anaesthetic to have the tendon cleaned. We were told he was very lucky to have caught it early as it could have been very serious. My son said the consultant commented on it being missed at the health centre.  \r\nWe can’t fault the consultant and the hospital staff on his treatment - they were very thorough and professional. However, I do worry that due to covid we are as patients seeing people in our health centres who are perhaps not able to make these diagnosis. If there’s even a slightest bit of doubt with a patient I feel they should seek a second opinion from a doctor or make an onward referral to a hospital.

I had had a 16 hour induced labour, towards the end of which I developed a high temperature due to an undiscovered infection which passed to the baby, who then needed five days of antibiotics and monitoring. By this point I was exhausted from the labour and 30 hours without sleep and still dealing with a traumatic birth, C-section and an infection, whilst also obviously being worried about my baby’s health.  \r\nI should say to start with that most of the midwives on the ward were lovely, kind and helpful. However, unfortunately they were out-shadowed by one or two who made my time there a misery. My stay happened during the COVID-19 pandemic, which meant that my partner had to leave me once I was admitted to the ward and was only allowed to visit for three hours a day. Usually partners are able to stay and help look after the baby while the mum recovers, so not having this help made it a very difficult and lonely experience, especially being a first time mum and after a C section when it is difficult to move and lift the baby. In my opinion the staff did not compensate for this and offer the extra care and support needed.  \r\nI was encouraged to breastfeed my baby which I did as much as I could. However over the next couple of days she was constantly crying and hungry, while I was increasingly struggling with pain and exhaustion. At night I asked several times for help with my baby as she wouldn’t settle but was just told ‘babies cry’ and to breastfeed more often (at this point I was feeding her at least every two hours, sometimes for an hour at at a time but she was still unsettled). By the second day I was unable to lift myself in or out of bed or to lift my baby out of the cot to feed her. One of the midwives could see how much pain I was in and said I should be on stronger painkillers; I was given oramorph, which was the only thing up until that point that reduced my pain. The following day the staff changed over and I asked for another dose thinking that this would not be an issue. I was told by a young and very cold-mannered midwife that I didn’t need it and should be able to manage on paracetamol and ibuprofen. I explained that the paracetamol and ibuprofen had not been sufficient to control my pain previously and that I had already been given oramorph, but again it was refused and I was left in a lot of pain.  \r\nThe next day the same midwife returned and explained that my baby needed to be weighed. Weighed the baby and went off to calculate the results whilst I fed my baby. When they returned they seemed cross and started tapping at the results, saying that my baby had lost too much weight and that this was ’not good.’ The way that I was spoken to me made me feel like I was back at school being told off by a stern teacher for doing something wrong. Then proceeded to what I can only describe as berate me, saying that I was not feeding my baby enough or correctly, that if my baby didn’t recover well from her infection it would be down to me, and that this needed to be sorted this out ‘straight away’ by getting the feeding team to come and see what I was doing wrong. My baby was at this point crying and they said, ‘See, she is hungry and you are not responding to her, this is the problem.’ (I had literally just put her down at this point following a feed). Told me that I needed to feed her ‘now’ and that I would need to spend the rest of the day feeding her constantly. At this point I was too shocked at the way I just been spoken to to respond. When they walked out I burst into tears, feeling hurt and upset but also so guilty that I had done this to my baby. I was crying so much I took myself off to the toilet to try and get it out and wash my face before the feeding team arrived.  \r\nWhen I retuned to my bed a member of the feeding team was there, along with aforementioned midwife. I had prepared myself to be told off again by the new midwife and was surprised when they were immediately kind and warm and asked me what was wrong, and could see I was still fighting back tears. Then told me again and again that I didn’t need to be upset, I hadn’t done anything wrong and wasn’t sure why I blaming myself; that several midwives had mentioned how hard I had been trying with the breastfeeding and that there were lots of reasons why my baby might be underweight or my milk supply low, none of which were my fault. Also said that the weight loss was only slightly over what they would expect and that they weren't worried at all at this stage, that they were there to help and that it could easily be sorted out. At this point I was crying again and the other midwife started to look very guilty and, probably worried that I might say something, joined in saying that it was not my fault. Apologised if I had ‘misunderstood’ the earlier manner, but this did not seem like a genuine apology.Despite the midwife’s kindness and reassurance I just couldn’t forget how the first midwife had spoken to me and made me feel and I continued to cry on and off until my partner arrived, when I told him what had happened. He was really angry and wanted to go and speak to staff straight away, but I begged him not to because I didn’t want to antagonise the issue further and make my remaining time on the ward more miserable than it had been already.  \r\nI was advised to start expressing every three hours with breastfeeds inbetween for the rest of that day and night, which I did. But my baby was still crying and hungry and at this point I asked for some formula top up which several of the midwives were very reluctant to give, and when they did gave the tiniest amounts which didn’t satisfy her. By the next morning I was exhausted having had around an hour of sleep, miserable and in pain. The staff changed over again and two lovely midwives took over my care. They both could see the state I was in and told me that if I wanted to switch to formula I could and that I didn’t need to feel guilty. I don’t think I have ever felt so relieved in my life at this point and gratefully agreed, gave my baby a decent feed of formula and had my first proper rest since I was admitted whilst my baby slept peacefully. Thankfully I was discharged that evening. I continued this way and my baby quickly got back up to a healthy weight.  \r\nI did not attempt breastfeeding again, which I believe was in part due to how guilty and useless I was made to feel about it - I could not associate it with anything other than negative feelings and memories. Although my baby is healthy and happy, I believe that this might not have happened if the circumstances had been different. I still feel traumatised and shocked by the treatment I received and it has put me off the thought of having another baby at Treliske.  \r\nI would however would like to thank the other midwives on Wheal Fortune Ward for being amazingly kind during an otherwise horrible stay. I should also say the midwives and anaesthetists on the Delivery Suite and in theatre were fantastic.","criticality":"moderately

After contacting the surgical team and speaking to Karen 10/10 she helped me get my GP refer me to the SACU unit.  \r\nThe GP initially refused to refer me or see me saying that it was the hospitals responsibility when in fact it was the GP’s. When I was eventually referred I saw two lovey doctors in the SACU department who had me sent for an urgent CT scan where it was decided I would receive my operation to repair my hernia right away.  \r\nInitially I was admitted to Ward 4 where I was looked after by one particular nurse from whom I received first class service. And this was a consistent approach from all the lovely and friendly staff in ward 4 and the operating theatre. I thank them for that.  \r\nI was then moved to ward 6. The service I received in ward 4 was sorely missed in ward 6. When I first arrived around 10pm I was left with no help to unpack my things and no nurses came to see me or introduce them self’s to me other than to take my OBS. During night in ward 4 all the curtains around the beds were shut except a small doorway to allow you to go to the toilet but keep your privacy. Unfortunately in ward 6 there was no such night procedure. Ward 6 could defiantly take a leaf out of ward 4’s book.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-08-30T18:20:59.94","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-09-01T12:53:05.63","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lanarkshire","count":7},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":1},{"name":"South Lanarkshire Health and Social Care Forum","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/783561","id":"783561"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/783561/responses","id":"783561"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/783561/healthservices","id":"783561"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/783561/tags","id":"783561"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l302h_100","id":"L302H_100","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l302h-sru","id":"l302h-sru","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l302h-tra","id":"l302h-tra","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sad","id":"sad"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ct","id":"ct"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ct%20scan","id":"CT scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctors","id":"doctors"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hernia","id":"hernia"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hernia%20repair","id":"hernia repair"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mixed%20care%20experience","id":"mixed care experience"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/operation","id":"operation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/patient%20privacy","id":"Patient privacy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scan","id":"scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgical%20team","id":"surgical team"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/umbilical%20hernia","id":"umbilical hernia"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/784483","id":"784483"}]},{"id":783788,"author":"Ouchy","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Gastroscopy","body":"My experience was horrific.  \r\nI cannot fault the nurses who were thorough and demonstrated great care.  \r\nI elected to have my gastroscopy with an anaesthetic applied to the back of my throat, as I was told by this method that although the procedure might be uncomfortable it would not be painful.  \r\nHowever, the anaesthetic was applied to my throat in a manner I consider to be haphazard and hurried.

When my husband and a friend eventually managed to get me upright it was decided that I had better go to A&E in Lincoln at the County Hospital.  \r\nI arrived at A&E at around lunchtime. I was then sent to the Urgent Treatment Centre where I was treated by Nurse Practitioner Becky, she was helpful and kind. I was sent for a chest x-ray because of my past history and age. When I returned I was informed me that I had 2 broken ribs and a possible 3rd broken rib. (I had had previous surgery that same side where the surgeon broke ribs in order to get at problem, I had a leiomyoma as big as a large grapefruit I learned later)  \r\nAt this point I did not have my arm x-rayed. Becky said that I needed a 2 night stay in hospital to get the pain under control because of the risk of pneumonia. It was by now approximately mid afternoon.  \r\nBecky said I needed a CT scan and would have to return to A&E for them to arrange this, so she took me there, I waited until called in and the doctor said that they couldn’t see any broken ribs on the x-ray and that after I had my arm x-rayed I could go home.  \r\nI waited again and went to x-ray as I had been told, then waited again it was by now late afternoon, and waited and waited. A few hours later a nurse made me a cup of tea and 2 paracetamols, I never saw 1st doctor again, I was informed that he was a consultant and higher up than the ones who said I had broken ribs!  \r\nAt around 8pm a young doctor called me to a side room, they said they would look at my arm x-ray and to wait back in the waiting room, where again I sat in the only comfortable chair I could find, I never saw this doctor again either.  \r\nAt approximately 9pm I told the reception that I was tired and hungry and was going home having waited around for nearly 9 hours. I got in the car (my husband had waited in the car all this time) and we started to go home only to be called by another doctor at the hospital asking me to please come back as I had a broken arm, and 3 broken ribs, so we turned round and went back where this doctor called Habid was waiting for me. He was the best person I saw he showed me the x-rays and I clearly saw the damage for myself.  \r\n3 broken ribs and broken elbow and a chip of bone floating around it I was put in a sling and told the fracture clinic would be contacting me to plaster my arm in the next few days. I was told to take many deep breaths to try and prevent pneumonia. The nurse asked another nurse to get a collar and cuff, I had no idea what this was, but anyway they could not find one.  \r\nI got home at about 10pm exhausted and in a lot of pain, I had to wait to this morning to get the Oramorph.  \r\nThe only people who were compassionate to me were Becky the Nurse practitioner, the doctor Habib and the nurse with him and the younger nurse who made me tea.  \r\nI will just add that I am an extremely vulnerable patient as I have autoimmune liver disease and have to take immune suppressants daily. I also have stomach problems.  \r\nI think my treatment, especially by the first consultant in A&E who said I had no broken ribs, was very poor for a high-risk person or for that matter anyone.  \r\nI had to return to A&E a day or so later, I saw triage nurse who never ever looked up when I went in, (very rude), I had temporary plaster put on the arm. I saw another nurse, who didn’t seem to believe that a collar and cuff was going to be put on, she said that they don’t put collar and cuff on an injury like this and that there were lots of them in the department at any time, I felt that I was being called a liar.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-08-31T11:08:55.1166667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-09-01T14:18:48.397","readBy":[{"name":"United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust","count":5}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/783583","id":"783583"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/783583/responses","id":"783583"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/783583/healthservices","id":"783583"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/783583/tags","id":"783583"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rwdda_180","id":"RWDDA_180","score":3},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rwdda-xray","id":"rwdda-xray","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frightened","id":"frightened"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/accident","id":"accident"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/arm","id":"arm"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/autoimmune","id":"autoimmune"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/broken","id":"broken"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/broken%20elbow","id":"broken elbow"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/consultant","id":"consultant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctor","id":"doctor"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/exhausted","id":"exhausted"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hungry","id":"hungry"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurse","id":"nurse"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pneumonia","id":"pneumonia"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thirsty","id":"thirsty"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vulnerable","id":"vulnerable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/x-rays","id":"x-rays"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassionate","id":"compassionate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/attitude%20to%20patients%20in%20pain","id":"attitude to patients in pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tired","id":"tired"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/784287","id":"784287"}]},{"id":783810,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Failing patients/carers","body":"It takes a frustratingly long time to get through to the surgery on the phone (particularly in the morning) and emails sent to the practice managers are not responded to.

Although I work in England, I have many friends who work within the NHS in Wales and I asked them for some advice regarding infection control. The triage process was incredibly quick but when my obs were being taken the nurse and HCA both looked at each other and hid the machine from me and didn’t state what was wrong. The HCA just asked the nurse -ecg and bloods?” and didn’t tell me why this was being done. The HCA also didn’t wear any gloves whilst taking my bloods: I have a urine sample but I only found out the results of this by reading my X-ray form when I was sent to get one done. I was then asked to sit in the minors waiting area where I sat for many hours. I did attempt to ask for pain relief which never came. My name was then called round in the main waiting area but by the time I got there they had called someone else. I knocked on the nurses station door to be told by a doctor that she couldn’t find my ‘card’ and said she’d get someone to look into it but told me to go and wait back in the main waiting area.After a couple hours a doctor called me in and he was very lovely and got me pain relief before starting the examination. He told me he was going to refer me to the surgical team and asked me to go and wait back in the waiting area. About 8am on the next day, I was called in by an agency nurse who didn’t introduce himself and just told me to follow him to a different ward which was the SDMU. I was greeted by a lovely nurse called Lorna (I think that was her name). She triaged me and then sat me in a chair to wait for a doctors to come and see me. I was waiting for around 4-5 hours before a doctor came but the urology reg, sho and f1 had a public disagreement in the middle of the waiting area which I believe should have been done in private. I would like to say a huge thank you to the F1 doctor (I’m so sorry I can’t remember your name, but you examined me alongside the urology reg) who was working on the morning of that day in SDMU as you put me at ease so much and was the only person to fully explain things through to me and when I was visibly upset, he was the only person that made an effort to comfort me. 3 people attempted to take my blood with no result, but I know that is no fault of theirs, I’m just really tricky to take blood from. I sat again for about half an hour before walking out as I decided I’d rather wait until I was back in my normal trust to seek those repeat blood tests as I didn’t feel like I was respected and listened to properly here. Many staff weren’t wearing masks or were taking them off repeatedly whilst with patients, but I don’t know fully if your infection control measures are similar to those we use with PHE, but if they are the same, I don’t think a single member of staff followed the full PPE guidance.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-08-31T00:01:14.0666667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-09-01T15:20:57.143","readBy":[{"name":"Swansea Bay University Health Board","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/783572","id":"783572"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/783572/responses","id":"783572"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/783572/healthservices","id":"783572"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/783572/tags","id":"783572"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/7a3c7_101","id":"7A3C7_101","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helpless","id":"helpless"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20tests","id":"blood tests"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctor's%20communication","id":"Doctor's communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ecg","id":"ecg"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fed%20up","id":"fed up"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/infection%20control","id":"infection control"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kidney","id":"kidney"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/urology","id":"urology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/x-ray","id":"X-ray"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ppe","id":"ppe"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/784875","id":"784875"}]},{"id":783817,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Lack of care","body":"Really poor communication skills and compassion shown by male GP.

We were just told to go and had to walk the entire length of the main hospital with no assistance and lifts out of order.  I’ve heard lots of great things about SDH but I’m afraid to say the only good thing was the surgery. The ward staff were shockingly bad,  no bedside manner or caring ability came across at all- sure they did what they needed to, but with no interaction or assistance and certainly no friendliness.  Such a shame....

The service provided by the mental health nurse has been great. From helping me come to terms with what was happening, to starting treatment and now maintaining health.  \n One thing I particularly like is that it feels \"normal\". It doesn't feel like a mental health service- actually it's no different from seeing a GP in that regard. I've not had to wait lengthy periods to access help, appointments are not restricted, I don't feel nervous about the building or being seen/stigmatized by visiting a psych. hospital with the natural anxiety that doing so can induce. \nThe nurse is very knowledgeable regards all aspects of care and has been able to refer me to talking therapies as well as provide medication support. \nI always feel that my G.P is very busy, normally a little behind in appointments and I try not to see them other than for the most serious concerns- which i think is the right approach. \nWith the mental health nurse- I receive regular reviews but also feel comfortable making an appointment if I spot triggers but before my condition becomes too overwhelming to cope with.   \nSeeing a mental health specialist in a GP's is also a great way to start assimilating (and de-stigmatizing)  mental and physical health. I hope it becomes more common (particularly if I ever move home!).\nOverall the surgery compares well to the few others I have been registered with. GP appointments can be difficult to get but that is the same everywhere. My children visit the surgery for their appointments as well- both for immunization and general matters. I've always been able to get an appointment quickly for them, and the child care nurse covers all the normal jabs etc. Happy with that. \nThe outstanding feature for me though is the mental health support provided.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-09-01T14:47:59","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-09-01T17:21:29","readBy":[{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2020)","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/783856","id":"783856"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/783856/responses","id":"783856"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/783856/healthservices","id":"783856"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/783856/tags","id":"783856"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/g85031","id":"G85031","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nervous","id":"nervous"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/depression","id":"depression"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diagnosis","id":"diagnosis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/normal","id":"normal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/periods","id":"periods"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happy","id":"happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hope","id":"Hope"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/no%20hope","id":"no hope"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/934356","id":"934356"}]},{"id":783860,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Good service provided","body":"Appointments always on time, never feel rushed with the GP or Practice Nurse.
