As I entered the centre, I noticed a table just inside the entrance and the passageway was partly roped off, but had sufficient room for people to pass. I paused to look for instructions, there were none, so I walked in and headed for reception. I was greeted by a very bad tempered woman bellowing out \"whoa, whoa, whoa, you can't just walk in like that\" and ushered me back to the table, asked whether I had any virus symptoms and took my temperature. As all was OK, I was allowed to approach reception. No apology for the very brusque manner. I have to say that I'm usually treated very well at the centre, the lady on reception and the nurse that treated me were lovely, but the way I was spoken to when I arrived was unacceptable. Fully appreciate the need to keep patients safe, which is why I paused to read any instructions, but this sort of attitude doesn't help anybody. Please review signage and staff training.

","body":"I feel very fortunate to have been given the opportunity to work with my therapist. I felt held, heard and understood which allowed for a genuine counsellor/client relationship built on mutual trust and respect.  We developed a great connection which helped me to feel safe enough to explore my issues, face my anxieties and work through them whilst feeling safe and supported. My therapist was quite stern at times which was always in my best interests and still done with great patience, kindness and empathy. I will always be grateful for this as it encouraged me to keep going even through my darkest moments when I felt like running away. I can see now that with her support I found the strength to really face my demons and at times it was an incredible challenge but through hard work and a deeper understanding of myself and my issues it was well worth the effort as it has led to a much calmer place in my mind and body...I feel stronger and much more at ease... Guess you really do reap what you sow! \nThe start of each session involved me being given choices plus the opportunity to add ideas on how the sessions may go, this was good as it created a sense of balance, equalness between my therapist  and I, plus I never once felt I was being forced to do anything against my wish. Homework was given which was great as it encouraged me to keep working on myself between sessions.\nThese 12 weeks have led me to a place where I can finally see a brighter future.  I'm under no illusion that all is completely perfect in my life now, there is still work to be done, however the path ahead is clearer as I've learned how to self soothe rather than rely on others for reassurance when I'm feeling anxious, therefore I'm seeing new perspectives when things feel tough like there's no way out... because there always is. Also, I feel it is very important to realize that when therapy ends the work should not. I'm still using all the exercises practiced, worksheets given, and notes taken whenever I feel necessary.  Some of the tools I've been given are now part of my daily regime and really help me to ditch not so helpful habits and introduce new and healthier ones... the beauty of self awareness and acceptance!\nI have much and gratitude respect towards NHS Talking Therapies and to my wonderful therapist Ilknur.

Several hours later I was told to ‘go home and live with it’. A friend picked me up. I tried to walk up stairs when I got in and passed out. My wife took me to the northern general hospital at Sheffield they sorted everything out and put a comprehensive prevention plan in place. \nI have again been to DRI A&E twice this week with excruciating back and leg pain caused by a prolapsed disk. This again was in an ambulance as I am unable to walk due to the pain. On the first occasion I was given a little pain relief, same as I have at home that doesn’t work. I was asked to stand for 15 seconds this was horrendously painful I was then left alone, I couldn’t get back on the bed so I lay on the floor. I was sent home still in screaming agony being told they couldn’t do anything. I ended up back in A&E less than 48 hours later with the same, but now worse, pain, I was prescribed different pain medication and sent home still screaming in agony.

I am talking about the receptionists. There are a couple of them that unfortunately they have not the gift of “Customer Service”, they are rude from the moment they answer the phone, they make it very clear they don’t have any intention to help you, any intention to listen, cannot be bothered and have no manners whatsoever, they make it very clear they don’t want to be there and very clear that they hate this job..So you find yourself having to be extra careful on the tone you use when talking to them, on what you say to them, trying to be extra polite so that they may be just about ‘ok’ with you...Even before you speak they already have that “Passive Aggressive” attitude on the phone, making you feel you are a monster calling and they have to be nasty to you even before the conversation starts. My recent call at the surgery again wasn’t pleasant, considering that with this Covid situation we have to adapt to a new-way of living I asked if possible to give me an indication on when the Dr would call me, as I have to fit this call in between my daily routine meetings and other appointments. At first they said the call was booked for today at anytime, when I asked to be a bit more specific they were very annoyed and rudely said that they couldn’t give a time and it could be any time today, I then tried to explain my other commitments and appointments of the day and asked to leave a note to the Dr to try to avoid calling me during that time, I was then told that I was booked for the morning slot! So a minute earlier she couldn’t give me a time slot and suddenly I had a morning slot appointment?!? The thing that shocked me the most though is that while at the surgery waiting to be called in I overheard them making comments about patients, mostly calling them names and swearing at them after hanging up the phone, once after they hang up a call loudly they said the “F” words! The only way I can describe them (a couple of them only) is very unsympathetic, unhelpful, disrespectful, rude, bully with no manners and respect what so ever! They really needs to start from scratch...go back to basics or go home and leave space to new staff who seems to be thousands times better!","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-08-03T08:37:59","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-08-03T08:50:42","readBy":[{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2021)","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/778987","id":"778987"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/778987/responses","id":"778987"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/778987/healthservices","id":"778987"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/778987/tags","id":"778987"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/h84619","id":"H84619","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/annoyed","id":"annoyed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/shocked","id":"shocked"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/get%20fit","id":"get fit"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gift","id":"gift"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/779346","id":"779346"}]},{"id":776327,"author":"MrsRMB","authorRoleId":1,"authorRole":"a carer","title":"Sick Note/Fit Note - Post Operative Cancer Surgery","body":"My husband had part of his kidney removed at Castle Hill Hospital in Hull.

On arrival I was unable to weight bear and hopped from the door to the reception without assistance from staff. Once booked in I waited to be triaged. I asked the receptionist and a member of nursing staff on 2 separate occasions for any pain killers and was advised that I would get some once triaged.  \r\nI was called in by a nurse who asked me what happened. The nurse noted down the details of the incident but failed to take any observations or ask about my pain score. My foot was deformed at the ankle, ice cold to touch and the capillary refill was over 4 seconds. None of this was assessed.  \r\nI asked for pain relief and was given 2 paracetamol and sat in a small waiting area to go for an xray. The porter and xray technician were the only positive experience I had during my visit and both were polite, courteous and professional. I was taken back to the waiting area after my xray.  \r\nMy pain was worsening while sitting and I asked a junior doctor and a member of nursing staff for more pain killers. The doctor walked past the door and said they had asked someone to get it and it hopefully should be soon. I waited nearly an hour.  \r\nOnce a member of nursing staff brought me into the cubicle I was given 1 tablet of dihydrocodeine. This was ineffective.  \r\nI then waited for the doctor for another half an hour. Once assessed, the doctor advised it was a hairline fracture and provided me with a moon boot and a leaflet, referring me to the online fracture clinic. The doctor advised that all I would need is regular paracetamol and ibuprofen, both of which had already proved ineffective. The doctor told me that I was to wear the moon boot for 2 days and after that I should be fine. 11 days since the injury I am still unable to wear anything other than the moon boot and I still have significant bruising and excruciating pain when sleeping or attempting to wear normal footwear.  \r\nYesterday I contacted the online fracture clinic as I had not heard from them and my pain was worsening and the nurse told me that I had not been referred.  \r\nI gave my employers inaccurate time scales regarding my injury and I am now looking at extensive time off. Having spoken to other medical professionals I believe the treatment and diagnosis management I have received has been grossly below par.  \r\nI am now hoping the online fracture clinic nurse I spoke to can put together an effective rehabilitation plan as my mobility is still incredibly limited and my pain still not under control.  \r\nI am extremely disappointed by the service and treatment I received both on the day and afterwards, and I very much look forward to hearing from a member of hospital management.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-07-31T06:55:21.8533333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-08-03T09:20:04.103","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Forth Valley","count":11},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":1},{"name":"University of Suffolk","count":1},{"name":"Partnership for Change","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/778753","id":"778753"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/778753/responses","id":"778753"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/778753/healthservices","id":"778753"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/778753/tags","id":"778753"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/forth-valley-royal-ae","id":"forth-valley-royal-ae","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/aftercare","id":"aftercare"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ankle","id":"ankle"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/assessment","id":"assessment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/broken%20foot","id":"broken foot"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bruising","id":"bruising"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diagnosis","id":"diagnosis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain%20relief","id":"pain relief"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/porter","id":"porter"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/radiographer","id":"radiographer"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/rehabilitation","id":"rehabilitation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20disappointed","id":"very disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/loss%20of%20mobility","id":"loss of mobility"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/779388","id":"779388"}]},{"id":778858,"author":"Milster1968","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Lack of communication and urgency in emergency department","body":"I went to a & e with an idea I may have a kidney infection, turns out it was a water infection, a gallstone and sciatica.  \r\nSeemed extremely uncoordinated from the start and my overall opinion is that communication within the department and between staff is not where it needs to be. I booked in at just after 9pm didn't get out till 2am even tho the time wait was 1-2 hrs.  \r\nWasn't overly busy either, however I saw many more people come and go... there doesn't seem to be any sense of urgency anywhere, the main culprits being the drs themselves, shuffling along at a very steady rate.  \r\nIn all during my visit I would estimate my time actually having processes and treatment equated to roughly 30mins (10-15 solely having a ct scan), by 5hrs into my visit I complained and was informed they had forgot about me when actually I should already have been allowed home. I only did this as a woman did the same 10 mins before me and low and behold she was speedily sorted out.  \r\nI volunteered in the Pilgrim in lockdown and had utmost regard for the staff. I worked hard and thorough and felt like I was part of a great team, however this visit made me feel very overlooked, undervalued and inconsequential. I wish I hadn't have bothered to be honest even though it was the right thing to do. Hope I never have to repeat the scenario.  \r\nI will add that I was in work from 8am that morning, had nothing as such to eat and was extremely tired and drained. When I got in my car to go home I openly admit I sobbed all the way home, I felt so let down by the whole experience.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-07-31T19:32:06.8533333","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2020-08-03T09:20:04.227","readBy":[{"name":"United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust","count":6}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/778858","id":"778858"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/778858/responses","id":"778858"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/778858/healthservices","id":"778858"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/778858/tags","id":"778858"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rwdla_180","id":"RWDLA_180","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disappointed","id":"disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/coordination","id":"coordination"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ct%20scan","id":"CT scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gallstone","id":"gallstone"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sciatica","id":"sciatica"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/inconsequential","id":"inconsequential"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/no%20hope","id":"no hope"}]},{"id":778756,"author":"Larst55","authorRoleId":8,"authorRole":"a staff member posting for a patient/service user","title":"Very grateful to the team","body":"Struggling with my walking outdoors and have had quite a lot of falls, visited at home by the Community Therapy Team and assessed outside to see how i managed.

My bloods were completed and 24 hours later the GP had contacted me again without any need to chase up and all this was done without me needing to take any time off work.  I must point out that I did not need to physically see a GP for this appointment, I just needed to discuss a non-urgent query.

I am now 62. The Doctor at the surgery have no time to get to know the patient. I remember the 3 Drs who were in the practice. The practice was a house on Hopewell road and Barham Road The three Doctors would call in to see how the family were. after a illness they knew all the families by name My Dad was a fisherman and when he came home I would take the Doctors some fish they knew all the family and nothing was to much bother they always had the time. my brother in law was really ill.  \r\nNow the new Doctors I don't even know what their names are. when my mum became ill I was constantly asking for a visit. In March I called the Doctor again asking for a visit. On the Sunday a nurse came to see mum from Longhill and could not do enough she went up and above to help us with our mum. On the Monday after diadem medical practice decided to send us a Doctor but by this time my mum was in a coma we received no care or advice about my mum from this surgery.  \r\nshe passed away 4 days later. She had worked hard all her life and deserved better. My Partner is very ill and no Doctor has been out to see him he was asked to come in and give Blood. he was told to ring for blood results in a week when he did the blood had never reached the lab, he then had to go back and do more blood test he has lost 3 stone in weight and still no Doctor visit only telephone consultation.  \r\nI rang the Doctors again for a visit I got told to ring 111 when I did they told me to call my Doctor as my partner needed a visit we have finally got a appointment they say we should be carful as we could lose our NHS.  \r\nI think with the service we are receiving it's hanging on by a thread .

Felt worse, in spite of prescribed antibiotics and took the very lucky decision to visit A&E. Staggered into A&E with extreme breathing difficulties that were worsening by the hour and from that moment, received 150% care.  \r\nAfter Covid19 test, CT scan and other explorations it was clear I was suffering blood clots on both lungs, technically pulmonary embolism. Given blood thinning injections and medicines, then transferred to a general ward for monitoring vital functions, the general attention was exemplary.  \r\nI cannot offer higher praise to all the staff who dealt with my health, from my initial induction through A&E, porters, cleaning, catering, technical, nursing; everyone, co-operation, co-ordination, communication and teamwork. It would be unfair to mention all the names and can't remember them all anyway. Just suffice to say that, after three nights/four days I am discharged and very definitely on the mend.  \r\nAlways enjoying great health, this experience was a shock as one expects to be almost invulnerable. The condition had clearly been building since January when I first felt the symptoms that strangely almost disappeared until re-emerging to a greater extent in June.  \r\nSo I spent the best part of a week in hospital, my co-patients were great; probably suffering worse illnesses than me, I just feel very lucky to have entered the hospital when I did.

At each appointment we were treated with the upmost professionalism and kindness by every individual we met. What was really lovely for me was that at each stage staff would congratulate me on getting that far and share their excitement at how well we were doing. We felt so supported throughout our treatment.  \r\nWe were delighted to fall pregnant on our first cycle and attending for our first scan was such a lovely experience. The staff were as excited and pleased as we were. We cannot thank everyone at Glasgow ACS for giving us our beautiful daughter.  \r\nDelighted as we were to be pregnant, being so during a pandemic is not without its challenges and the care I received from my community midwife Margaret at Llanark Health Centre was exemplary. She was so so kind and always took the time to make sure I could record baby’s heartbeat for my husband to hear, answered every daft question I had and genuinely was a god send throughout my pregnancy.  \r\nFinally we would like to thank everyone at the maternity unit at Wishaw University Hospital for delivering our baby safely and taking such excellent care of us.  \r\nOur delivery and subsequent care was amazing especially given it didn’t quite all go to plan. Each and every member of staff was professional kind and a joy to be looked after by. Special mention to the final year midwifery students Ashleigh, Kirsty, Karen and Lauren. You ladies are born for your profession and we wish you all the best with your new careers.  \r\nWithout the NHS we would not have our beautiful daughter and we cannot thank you enough for this amazing gift and for taking such good care of us as a family each and every step of the way.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-08-01T16:22:11.4533333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-08-03T13:45:21.017","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":11},{"name":"NHS Lanarkshire","count":6},{"name":"Ulster University, MBBS (Medicine) 2021","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/778903","id":"778903"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/778903/responses","id":"778903"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/778903/healthservices","id":"778903"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/778903/tags","id":"778903"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/g107h-assisted-conception","id":"G107H-assisted-conception","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l308h_501","id":"L308H_501","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sl9-community-maternity","id":"SL9-community-maternity","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/delighted","id":"delighted"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/delivery","id":"delivery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ivf","id":"IVF"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kind","id":"kind"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kindness","id":"kindness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/maternity","id":"maternity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pregnancy","id":"pregnancy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professionalism","id":"professionalism"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/779049","id":"779049"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/779686","id":"779686"}]},{"id":778921,"author":"Clumsy Gardener","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Kind, humorous and professional","body":"I was treated there in August for a deep cut to my ankle and just wanted to say that all of the staff are excellent from start to finish from the porter to the Doctors!

The receptionists have no mannerisms at all and make me wonder what qualifications they have and how they even got their job in the first place. Speaking to them on the phone recently, they tried giving me medical advice that would require a doctors level of knowledge! Also they have no sense of confidentiality easily giving away medication details over the phone when asked with no confirmation of identity. Calling in the morning is ridiculous for an appointment; I've once had to call over a hundred times to even get through to make an appointment. Now in terms of my second point, I have had chronic knee pain for months and I went for three appointments at this medical centre to find out the cause of the pain and for some treatment. The first appointment resulted in me getting a print out of exercises which I could try at home, which is an understandable conservative approach to the pain. Then the last time I went, I was told by a doctor I would be given a physiotherapy appointment at the hospital. I waited for months and never received a letter for an appointment. So, I registered at a GP surgery in Birmingham close to my university and booked a same-day appointment easily for my knee pain. The doctor there did a full knee examination of me on the bed testing every ligament whilst the doctors at Derby Family Medical Centre did partial knee examinations on me whilst I was sat on a chair. Then my Birmingham doctor gave me my diagnosis in the same appointment, and booked an appointment right in front of me for a physiotherapy appointment and allowed me to choose the date and time. Now can you see the difference in care between these two places? The Derby surgery failed to give me a diagnosis and support over many appointments and months. Whilst the Birmingham surgery managed to give me my diagnosis and treatment plan within the same 10 minute appointment. My point here is that one of these places still has the paternalistic approach to a doctor-patient appointment whilst the other place has the patient-centred approach which is most definitely what is needed in this day and age. The majority of the patients at Derby Family Medical Centre may not have English as their first language so the paternalistic approach may seem appropriate but with my mother at this surgery, I can confirm that she would much rather be involved with decisions regarding her medical plan and not be denied access to any medical decisions made about herself.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2019-10-07T15:55:51","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2020-08-03T14:21:51","readBy":[{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2021)","count":1},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2020)","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/779053","id":"779053"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/779053/responses","id":"779053"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/779053/healthservices","id":"779053"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/779053/tags","id":"779053"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/c81118","id":"C81118","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diagnosis","id":"diagnosis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/knee","id":"knee"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/language","id":"language"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ligament","id":"ligament"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/physiotherapy","id":"physiotherapy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"}]}]
