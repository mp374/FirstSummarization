I returned home and tried for more than a week to speak to my GP.  \r\nThe Covid and flu took nearly 3 weeks to clear but left me with what I thought was a nasty facial cold sore. I visited an outpatient treatment clinic and they told me it was a wart and could not help. I tried again for more than a week to get a GP appointment, eventually speaking to the receptionist who promised me a call back from one of the doctors, but nothing. I tried again and after 3 days and countless redials over many attempts I spoke to the receptionist again. She explained that the doctor had tried calling me, which I do not believe is true; I was home the whole time and had no missed calls.  \r\nI could not get a new appointment. By this time I was looking at self-treatment by freezing it (a kit you can buy at the pharmacy). I tried it but it failed to go away or shrink. At a second attempt to treat it myself the pharmacist said it didn't look like a wart but something else. I have other long acute conditions which I get prescription drugs and wanted to speak at least to my GP to ask if they could be causing the warts. It's impossible. The NHS staff are brilliant professionals and I can't say a bad word about them but this situation is degrading people's lives. I have not returned to work as my facial disfigurement is embarrassing.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-04-21T07:45:02.11","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2022-04-25T09:20:01.623","readBy":[{"name":"Healthwatch Portsmouth","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/933003","id":"933003"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/933003/responses","id":"933003"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/933003/healthservices","id":"933003"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/933003/tags","id":"933003"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/ntpad-general-surgery","id":"NTPAD-general-surgery","score":2},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/embarrassed","id":"embarrassed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frustrated","id":"frustrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appointments","id":"appointments"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kind%20staff","id":"kind staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/outpatient%20treatment","id":"outpatient treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pharmacy","id":"Pharmacy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wart","id":"wart"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gp%20access","id":"gp access"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%2019","id":"covid 19"}]},{"id":933028,"author":"Tomchar","authorRoleId":4,"authorRole":"a relative","title":"Wait for medication review","body":"My husband has bowel cancer with secondary liver and is currently undergoing palliative chemotherapy weekly.

Is it correct that it should be four weeks if there is an issue with his medication, which was clearly stated on the form when completing for the review? I’m just really pulling my hair out in complete frustration because it seems to be one thing after the other.  \r\nThe fact that we’ve been patients with Thorpewood for 19 years plus and no one has bothered to contact my husband to find out how he’s getting on with his cancer treatment is neither here nor there.

They do a fabulous and very hard job as they are they are the first person a patient encounters and I have only praise for them. A little kindness goes a long way. \n","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-04-25T04:14:08","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2022-04-25T10:10:52","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/933829","id":"933829"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/933829/responses","id":"933829"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/933829/healthservices","id":"933829"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/933829/tags","id":"933829"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/m86004","id":"M86004","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/normal","id":"normal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"}]},{"id":933827,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Refused /Ignored request to join practice...","body":"Despite online and calling I was informed that due to \"boundary changes\"I am unable to join.

I came into accident and emergency after getting head pain while working in Dublin I came straight here, that was nine days ago.  \r\nAccident and emergency was a nightmare, I had to wait 11 hours to get a bed in A&E and more hours to get transferred to a bed in female medical. It was a disaster.  \r\nWhile in female medical I was worse off than before I came in. I felt neglected all over the Easter break. I had a spinal tap done on good Friday and they did not tell me that I should have been lying down drinking caffeine and water for two days after, therefore I was walking about going up and down the stairs on phone calls and seeing my family outside the hospital. I was then informed the following Wednesday by the anaesthetist after everyone was back from their holidays that a procedure should have been done on my pin hole to help it heal the day after but I never got that done. Also they gave me morphine and to help with the pain, but was again informed that I should not have been getting it that I should have been getting normal pain medication. I even seen them fighting amongst themselves as they could not agree on or justify why I was given the morphine. They have ruled out that it is a head injury although have offered if I wait until Monday that they would transfer me to neurology in Craigavon, although they also told me I could go home and rest for a week. I have the same problem as I had when I came in as the only thing they have treated is the pain they caused me through the spinal tap that did not heal correctly  \r\nThe nurses are cannot be blamed they were just doing what they were told by a higher power. They were all grand.  \r\nOverall, this visit to the hospital has caused me unnecessary pain and suffering. It has been a waste of my time and has been a terrible experience.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-04-23T11:17:11.47","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-04-25T13:06:19.92","readBy":[{"name":"Southern Health and Social Care Trust","count":6}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/933519","id":"933519"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/933519/responses","id":"933519"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/933519/healthservices","id":"933519"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/933519/tags","id":"933519"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_33020_180","id":"ZT003_33020_180","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_33020-medical-f","id":"ZT003_33020-medical-f","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/neglected","id":"neglected"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/information","id":"information"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medical%20care","id":"medical care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ward%20staff","id":"ward staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/a&e%20waiting%20times","id":"a&e waiting times"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20kept%20informed","id":"not kept informed"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/935857","id":"935857"}]},{"id":933550,"author":"Matdw53","authorRoleId":8,"authorRole":"a staff member posting for a patient/service user","title":"Excellent care","body":"My care has been absolutely excellent ever since I arrived onto the ward on monday.

The front desk seems always chaotic and often very impolite and impatient. I have spoken to them regarding this multiple times and explained that they need to be more patience with people because we call them with a problem and want their help and advice, instead they are just automated robots not showing any understanding. I have always to call and follow up on referrals and check if they have been actually done or not and many times they were not done or cancelled by the hospital and we did not get notified. If they are expecting patients to follow up on an these things then at least inform us so we keep calling and checking. I asked if they have received my hospital report which has been more than a month ago and they simply told me to call the hospital myself and find out because they don't do that anymore. I ask them what happened with a referral for my son, she tells me the GP is on annual leave and we have to wait for him to come back, surely someone else can access the system and find out for me? But apparently this is not urgent, while I have been waiting already couple weeks for it. I tell them that I am unhappy with the service received by one of their clinicians, they tell me to look for another surgery!!!! This is absolutely disrespectful and I wouldn't know what to do with them anymore. Its not easy to change surgeries nowadays and moreover its emotionally not easy to keep speaking to different people about your health issues when you just got used to the surgery and what do they do? They just tell me to go somewhere else. This comment made me leave this feedback on here because I really want them to invest in their reception staff, educate them, train them and listen to patients comments. I believe they don't care what the reasons are for people leaving them instead of appreciating our feedback and work on the points we mention to them to improve their services.

I managed to get through the following Monday.  I needed a repeat prescription which a dermatologist had prescribed. I was told as it was over a year since it had been prescribed, I had to see GP. I asked if I could make appointment but was told they were all gone but to call back tomorrow. I explained I had tried for a week to get through.

I have had no issues and I honestly do not see how anyone could complain about the care they have received in the hospital after my experienced.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-04-23T17:25:56.5833333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-04-25T13:57:57.063","readBy":[{"name":"Southern Health and Social Care Trust","count":3}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/933549","id":"933549"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/933549/responses","id":"933549"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/933549/healthservices","id":"933549"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/933549/tags","id":"933549"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_32024_300","id":"ZT003_32024_300","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/attentive","id":"attentive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cleanliness","id":"cleanliness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nursing","id":"nursing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/food%20quality","id":"food quality"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/food%20quantity","id":"food quantity"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/933917","id":"933917"}]},{"id":933548,"author":"Matdw53","authorRoleId":8,"authorRole":"a staff member posting for a patient/service user","title":"Exceptional quality of nursing","body":"My Care in the hospital has been very good with this mostly down to the exceptional quality of nursing that I have received.

At the time I felt very irritated and annoyed with my current injury- as I am generally a very active person. Having had a phone consultation firstly with Mark - he provided a small glimpse of light at the end of the tunnel. He said that if I put the work in I will get back to fitness quicker.  \r\nAfter I was out of the cast I met with mark for face to face treatment- as I was now in a removable walking support boot. Ryan had given me a tailor made programme that was innovative compared to any others I had seen online, however advised caution at this early stage.  \r\nThrough a number of treatments I was showing slow and steady progress - at each session he was feeding off my enthusiasm I feel, which was of great benefit to myself. I am very self critical, however he was quick to removed any doubts I had about my own progress. I know am 5 months down the line and I’m not fully recovered but thanks to Ryan's assistance I am definitely past the uphill struggle in the early days of the injury.  \r\nThe NHS doesn’t get enough credit these days, and in the UK I feel is taken for granted. However I wish to pass on my sincere thanks to MSK at Crosshouse hospital for providing a first class service and in particular to Ryan at the physio department for doing such a great job.  \r\nThanks again!","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-04-22T17:40:27.9966667","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2022-04-25T14:02:57.697","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Ayrshire & Arran","count":6}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/933449","id":"933449"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/933449/responses","id":"933449"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/933449/healthservices","id":"933449"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/933449/tags","id":"933449"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/a111h-physiotherapy","id":"A111H-physiotherapy","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/annoyed","id":"annoyed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/assessment","id":"assessment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/excellent%20care","id":"excellent care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/first%20class%20care","id":"first class care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/great","id":"great"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/injury","id":"injury"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/inspired","id":"inspired"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/irritated","id":"irritated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/outpatient","id":"outpatient"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/physio","id":"physio"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/progress","id":"Progress"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/recovery","id":"recovery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/rehabilitation","id":"rehabilitation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/empowered","id":"empowered"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported","id":"supported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/empowering","id":"empowering"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/telephone%20consultation","id":"telephone consultation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thanks","id":"thanks"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/rewarding","id":"rewarding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/motivated","id":"motivated"}]},{"id":933502,"author":"BillyF62","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Radiotherapy","body":"I have just finished my course of radiotherapy for prostrate cancer yesterday at the Lanarkshire Beatson .  \r\nI would just like to thank all the nurses and staff for their professionalism and caring way they treated me.  \r\nThank you!  \r\nI wish all my treatment had went this way.  \r\nin January, I received a phone call from the Beatson West of Scotland to inform me I had missed an appointment that day and my cancer treatment was being put back for 4 weeks.  \r\nThis was a shock to me as I had never received any notification regarding this appointment and when I tried to explain to the caller that if I had received the appointment, I definitely would have remembered the date.  \r\nThe caller wasn’t interested and I felt very upset and stressed.
