Several chasing phone calls back and forth, messages going missing between calls etc. was told by a manager that demand for private counselling was very high and that they could effectively cherry pick who they wanted to take on their books. When I asked why they only took on the easier cases, they referred me to Camhs, despite acknowledging that there’s currently a 2 year waiting list and therefore this would not work for us. I was told that the doctors are self employed within their business model and could therefore take on who they wanted to help. This I guess is the essence of private care. The staff I spoke with were all helpful and professional. However I did feel that they simply couldn’t be bothered to help us, despite being in a really tough situation.

Why should i have to disclose my personal medical information to someone that is not a trained medical professional? I am unsure that non-medical staff will be able to triage patients effectively. Being that this person may also be someone that is familiar with people in your local area, what safeguards are in place that my information is being kept private?  \r\nI was told that no appointments were available. That the system doesn't book far enough ahead so i need to phone back in a weeks time for an appointment that presumably wont be for another 4 weeks. This is actual insanity. I was then advised to phone an ambulance. My discomfort is not serious enough to waste the time of ambulance staff who i can only imagine would be utterly perplexed why they are attending a call like this. In my opinion this system of using reception staff to gatekeep speaking to your doctor is completely unfit for purpose. There is no space for nuance, either you're at immediate risk and must phone an ambulance, or you're not and can therefore apparently wait 4-6 weeks for a phone call from your GP.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-12-02T17:52:16.45","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-12-06T09:20:03.133","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":3}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/900135","id":"900135"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/900135/responses","id":"900135"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/900135/healthservices","id":"900135"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/900135/tags","id":"900135"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sj9-general-practices","id":"sj9-general-practices","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/advice","id":"advice"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/chest","id":"chest"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/felt%20ignored","id":"felt ignored"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gp%20communication","id":"GP communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/privacy","id":"privacy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/triage","id":"triage"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wait%20times","id":"wait times"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/like%20a%20nuisance","id":"like a nuisance"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/getting%20an%20appointment","id":"getting an appointment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appointment%20waiting%20time","id":"appointment waiting time"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/900835","id":"900835"}]},{"id":900714,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Rebook and go elsewhere ","body":"Just been for the first time to Alderwood for my COVID booster, I would strongly recommend somebody from this practice visits other centres to see how they are organising the COVID booster programme.\n  I stood outside for nearly an hour in near freezing temperatures with every body else who believed they had booked an appointment.\n  Grossly understaffed for the volume of people and sadly very poor flow of the actual process, only one poor chap dealing with the non existent parking.\n  With hindsight I should have rebooked and gone to Great Worley.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2021-12-05T13:13:15","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2021-12-06T09:32:37","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/900714","id":"900714"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/900714/responses","id":"900714"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/900714/healthservices","id":"900714"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/900714/tags","id":"900714"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/m83107","id":"M83107","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/great","id":"great"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20believed","id":"not believed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/parking","id":"parking"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid","id":"covid"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%2019","id":"covid 19"}]},{"id":900717,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Very good department","body":"Having had to return to the walk in centre area of Chorley Hospital within days of my last visit ,due to a Change in my condition.

My husband stayed static in his seat, but I was thrown out of the passenger seat with my legs being locked in my seat by the seat belt, and my body behind my husband seat.  \r\nAs you can imagine this was terrifying and with help of the general public and the emergency services excellent response my husband was able to walk out of the car but I had to be cut out. This took time and was done professionally with great care,  \r\nI was then taken to Kings Mill Hospital A&E which was under a great deal of stress due to being extremely busy. There were beds with people in every space availability,I ended up next to the sink where staff had to wash their hands. I cannot express how stressful this situation affected me as I was in a head brace and flat on my back and could only hear chaos. I went into total shock and due to the amount of people coming into the A&E and the lack of staff I was left alone with very few people acknowledging my existence or my pain. I received all the correct tests (I think) but no real care, understanding and advice of what to expect after such a bad accident.  \r\nI understand that I was lucky because I had no broken bones or cuts, but I can assure you my body was shook and banged all over the inside of the car leaving me badly bruised inside and out. What I want to really say is that being in A&E that day was as traumatic as the accident and left me feeling stressed and full of anxiety. I cannot blame the staff but the system which fails these people to be able to deliver a professional and fully caring health service. I also think that they were having to deal with situations that GPs should be handling.  \r\nI hope this helps you understand how individuals really feel when they have faced something that will affect them for the rest of the lives.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-12-02T21:10:20.8033333","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2021-12-06T10:28:39.53","readBy":[{"name":"East Midlands Ambulance Service","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/900156","id":"900156"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/900156/responses","id":"900156"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/900156/healthservices","id":"900156"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/900156/tags","id":"900156"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rk5bc_180","id":"RK5BC_180","score":3},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rx9-emergency","id":"RX9-emergency","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/shocked","id":"shocked"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stressed","id":"stressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/accident%20&%20emergency","id":"accident & emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bruised","id":"bruised"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/car%20accident","id":"car accident"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/chaos","id":"chaos"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency","id":"emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency%20care","id":"emergency care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/head","id":"head"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/more%20staff","id":"more staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/overstretched","id":"overstretched"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/paramedics","id":"paramedics"}]},{"id":900727,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Never answers phone","body":"You’ll see that they have blamed the telephone company since 2020 for why they don’t answer their phones.

So it had to go in the general waste. The most astonishing thing was actually that the bottles, used to warm and feed expressed breast milk from or provide formula in, were thrown away. Not sterilised and reused. That’s not the teats, the actual bottles.  \r\nNot only must these practices be a colossal waste of money, but they are extremely harmful to the environment.

They were so kind and compassionate, always checking in on us and offering tea and biscuits. Nothing was too much trouble. The ward appeared to be really busy and staff run off their feet but they always had a kind smile and offered words of comfort. Special thanks to the sister and deputy sister who appeared to manage the ward very well, and had time to sit and chat. It's the small things that make a difference.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-11-07T12:35:56.6566667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-12-06T12:25:03.067","readBy":[{"name":"Belfast Health and Social Care Trust","count":7}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/893852","id":"893852"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/893852/responses","id":"893852"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/893852/healthservices","id":"893852"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/893852/tags","id":"893852"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt001_11021-acute-medical-ward","id":"ZT001_11021-acute-medical-ward","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxious","id":"anxious"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/comforted","id":"comforted"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kind","id":"kind"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/management","id":"management"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sister","id":"sister"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/special%20needs","id":"special needs"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tea%20and%20biscuits","id":"tea and biscuits"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ward%20sisters","id":"ward sisters"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassionate","id":"compassionate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/smiles","id":"smiles"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thanks","id":"thanks"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/chat","id":"chat"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/regular%20check%20ins","id":"regular check ins"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/902637","id":"902637"}]},{"id":900381,"author":"Janet61","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"My first ever hospital stay","body":"Having never ever been in a hospital in my 60 years, I was absolutely petrified going in. Everyone from the Post Menopausal Bleeding Clinic with a special mention for Sister Sheila to The Surgeon, Dr Allum at University Hospital, Wishaw, the Anaesthetist. Tomas, the theatre staff, Nadia, Rachel, Amanda, Elspeth, I remember all the names and the empathy shown when I was admitted for my op. They put me at ease and literally held my hand every step of the way. I was still laughing with Tomas when he was preparing to anaesthesise me but I was totally unaware of this and was in the middle of joking with him and boom I was asleep. The recovery staff were amazing, the ward staff in ward 13, Isavel, Sonia, Rachel, Jazz, Vicky, Andrea,.... Too many to mention. The way I was treated, you'd never know the NHS was struggling. These girls are working long hours and their only thought is for their patients. Every single one of them are angels. Even the cleaner and the meals staff were so lovely. Please recognise these people. To me it's them that represent the NHS and its them I will be flying the flag for. Their reassurance is commendable. Thank you will never, EVER cover it.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-12-03T18:31:58.6033333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-12-06T12:42:47.893","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lanarkshire","count":7}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/900381","id":"900381"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/900381/responses","id":"900381"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/900381/healthservices","id":"900381"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/900381/tags","id":"900381"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l302h_502","id":"L302H_502","score":5},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l308h_502","id":"L308H_502","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anaesthetist","id":"anaesthetist"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bleeding","id":"bleeding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/empathy","id":"empathy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hysterectomy","id":"hysterectomy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/menopausal","id":"menopausal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/post%20menopausal%20bleeding","id":"post menopausal bleeding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgeon","id":"surgeon"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ward%20staff","id":"ward staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20for","id":"cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/theatre%20team","id":"theatre team"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/901516","id":"901516"}]}]
