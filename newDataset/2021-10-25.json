Each time I called the phone was either engaged or ringing out with no-one answering. Eventually, when someone did answer, I was surprised to be told my mother had been transferred to Ward 81 without anyone letting me know. I was disappointed and frustrated with my inability to communicate with Ward 210, which exacerbated my stress levels at such a critical time. I rang Ward 81 in fear of similar contact problems, but was pleased that Alison answered the call promptly, which was a great relief. Alison immediately recognised my anxieties. She allayed my concerns regarding my mother's deteriorating situation and empathised regarding the communication difficulties I had experienced. Alison's caring professionalism retrieved the situation. The exemplary way in which she explained my mother's care plan, and identified proposals to overcome the hurdles delaying my mother's return to the nursing home for end of life care, were very reassuring. Alison's excellent communication skills involved genuine compassion. Immediately she identified clear actions that she proposed to take, which gave me confidence that she had a commitment to complete them. Over the following hours she delivered on those commitments. Alison's outstanding professionalism prompts me to draw the attention of management to an exceptional member of staff going above and beyond the call of duty.  \r\nI'm sure my frustrations with Ward 210 were born out of being over stretched and staff focussing on patient priorities, relative contact having by necessity to take second place, which I understand.  \r\nI wish to place on Alison's record my sincere appreciation for a job well done. Thank you Alison.  \r\n","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-10-21T21:58:49.4433333","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2021-10-25T10:20:12.237","readBy":[{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2021)","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/888588","id":"888588"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/888588/responses","id":"888588"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/888588/healthservices","id":"888588"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/888588/tags","id":"888588"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rje01_300","id":"rje01_300","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frustrated","id":"frustrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/above%20and%20beyond","id":"above and beyond"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care%20plan","id":"care plan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/empathy","id":"empathy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/end%20of%20life","id":"end of life"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professionalism","id":"professionalism"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appreciative","id":"appreciative"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassion","id":"compassion"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassuring","id":"reassuring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication%20with%20family","id":"communication with family"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/contactable","id":"contactable"}]},{"id":888727,"author":"BatemoorPatient","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Changes to how we receive healthcare","body":"The challenges created by the new paradigm shift of coronavirus has imposed significant changes on how we receive health care.

Learning how to sing, listening to on hold music, has become the norm. Translating my impatience into a positive benefit, I can sing. As soon as I get to speak to the reception staff, receive a call from the medical staff, I find the ambiance very friendly and professional. Any anxiety or concerns are resolved creating a better outcome.  \r\nThank you to:  \r\nThe practice Receptionists, very friendly and professional providing calming reassurance.  \r\nPractice Physicians Associates, listening, questioning and diagnosing effectively.

I duly said so I just have to put up with this and they said yes. End of conversation. I was not happy with the outcome. I went online and looked up feedback on hearing aids. I did get a few explanations which were very helpful. One being there could be a problem with the dome, I also remembered I had put in a new dome, luckily enough I had a spare and changed the said dome. What a difference. Problem solved. I was left feeling let down after the phone call. Before covid, I had no problems attending ear clinics to get dome and hearing aids checked. The staff at Wishaw are very helpful as are Stonehouse and Hairmyres. I unfortunately can't have a hearing aid in my right ear due to having a Mastoid operation when I was younger.

I am extremely grateful to the team who looked after me during my procedure. Diane, Jackie, Roseann and Jessica were fantastic, from explaining exactly what they would be doing during the procedure, to reassuring me throughout, keeping me calm and relaxed. They chatted to me about what may seem the most everyday of things, whilst providing the very best care at all times. The procedure was over before I knew it and I am very relieved and pleased to say I received a clean bill of health. Our NHS and those individuals who look after us at every part of the process, whatever it may be, are exemplary to say the very least. We have the most amazing and dedicated people who go above and beyond for those in their care every day, and in particular at the most difficult of times. I can't thank these four wonderful people enough for looking after me.  \r\nTo everyone in our wonderful NHS I would say that we have referred to you as being \"Hero's\" for almost two years now because of the amazing dedication you have shown to everyone during the recent pandemic, but truly you are Hero's every day in life for just being there for people like me.  \r\nA massive thank you from me, for everything.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-10-22T10:04:48.7833333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-10-25T12:02:44.903","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Forth Valley","count":5},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2021)","count":2},{"name":"NHS Education for Scotland","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/888747","id":"888747"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/888747/responses","id":"888747"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/888747/healthservices","id":"888747"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/888747/tags","id":"888747"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/forth-valley-royal-ambulatory","id":"forth-valley-royal-ambulatory","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/above%20and%20beyond","id":"above and beyond"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bowel","id":"bowel"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/colonoscopy","id":"colonoscopy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/experienced%20staff","id":"experienced staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/like%20an%20individual","id":"like an individual"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/calm","id":"calm"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassuring","id":"reassuring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/explanations","id":"explanations"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%2019","id":"covid 19"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/891974","id":"891974"}]},{"id":888777,"author":"empathymn78","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"The nurse was fantastic","body":"I attend Glenboig surgery for a long over due smear test.

She was visited by the Crisis Team and did not connect with them at all. As a parent I was extremely distressed by the whole event and couldn't understand what my daughter was experiencing. We tried private counselling - that didn't work. We tried the school - that didn't work and her cry for help was just getting louder by the day.  \r\nA referral had been made to CAMHS and it was a struggle to get her to even get into the car to attend the appointment. A further struggle to get her to go into the room and meet the Dr. However, she did and we were very lucky to be met by Dr Clarke. Dr Clarke took his time and carefully and patiently explained to my daughter why she was feeling the way she was. This did not happen overnight and he was always very patient and understanding. When she did want to start communicating he listened and involved me in the discussions. All appointments were made in full consultation with my daughter and I. He explained coping strategies that she understood and started apply. Thankfully, due to his caring and understanding nature we are through the worst part of this episode. My daughter has started looking to her future and made plans - she knows how to apply coping strategies, when needed and has a better understanding of why she felt the way she did.  \r\nI wanted to share this to let other parents know that there is help and also to let the CAMHS service know they are doing a great job..

She was quite sleepy and snuffly following the C-section and it was challenging getting breast feeding established. I had wonderful support from the staff in the ward day and night including midwifes and auxiliaries who were on hand to offer support and advice. One particular midwife called Cora helped me on the day shift on our second day in hospital. She took lots of time to show me different positions to try and support feeding and came back to check on us a number of times. Her manner was encouraging and supportive at a time that can feel exhausting and overwhelming and it made a big difference to our breast feeding journey.  \r\nA big thank you to the whole team at the Ulster Hospital Maternity unit but especially Cora for going that extra mile.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-10-22T14:47:07.2333333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-10-25T13:27:44.323","readBy":[{"name":"South Eastern Health and Social Care Trust","count":4},{"name":"Patient and Client Council","count":1},{"name":"Public Health Agency","count":1},{"name":"Ulster University, Faculty of Life and Health Sciences","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/888873","id":"888873"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/888873/responses","id":"888873"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/888873/healthservices","id":"888873"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/888873/tags","id":"888873"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt004_07021_501","id":"ZT004_07021_501","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/advice","id":"advice"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/birth","id":"birth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breast%20feeding","id":"breast feeding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breastfeeding%20support","id":"Breastfeeding Support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/c-section","id":"c-section"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/encouraging","id":"encouraging"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/maternity","id":"maternity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/midwives","id":"midwives"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supportive","id":"supportive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ward%20staff","id":"ward staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported","id":"supported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stress%20reduced","id":"stress reduced"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/889840","id":"889840"}]},{"id":888907,"author":"monocerosth86","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Put my mind at rest","body":"I walked into a bannister with my breast, which became very painful a few days later.  \r\nDoctor Rauf examined me and put my mind to rest and reassured me on what happened and why I was feeling so much pain.  \r\nIt was lovely seeing her again after so long!

Nearly ten years later my anxiety kicks in whenever I deal with the NHS.  \r\nI had my appendix removed last year, it went fine apart from scar tissue tearing a few months later, which rather wrecked a job interview.I got a letter telling me it was all fine and I felt better, however the next day I got another letter telling me I'd been referred to Urology as I had a kidney stone, anxiety kicks in as I knew nothing about this. I have had a stone before lets just say it didn't quite go to plan.I attended one interview with a Urologist, a flow test, a call trying to make an appointment and a phone consultation. Each of these caused an anxiety response.  \r\nI've ensured I made each of them aware of my situation and they appear to listen but just carry on anyway. The first letter from the interview, when they told me they wanted to remove the kidney (I did not agreed to this), they told me the remaining kidney appeared to be working. I challenged this as the poor use of language when I spoke to them and they responded quickly with 94%. Why didn't it say that in the letter instead of causing concern?  \r\nI received a letter after my phone consultation that states they wanted a face to face meeting but due to Covid concerns it was done by phone. This is completely wrong. I said I had no issues with Covid, I do have an issue driving for an hour or more having an anxiety attack just to talk to someone.  \r\nIt also states: Anxiety related to some previous hospital related management at another hospital. As I clearly stated that wasn't the case and what actually happened, I feel they're not really listening to me. I have little if any confidence in the NHS as it is but these little things just make it worse.  \r\nIn my experience I don't think the NHS deals with the problems they create, certainly not great at dealing with anxiety. Yes I could go to a GP but that would involve an anxiety attack.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-10-22T14:25:50.9766667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-10-25T14:11:57.567","readBy":[{"name":"Royal Devon University Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust","count":10},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2021)","count":3}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/888863","id":"888863"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/888863/responses","id":"888863"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/888863/healthservices","id":"888863"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/888863/tags","id":"888863"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rbz12_101","id":"RBZ12_101","score":4},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxious","id":"anxious"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20listening","id":"not listening"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kidney","id":"kidney"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kidney%20stone","id":"kidney stone"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/language","id":"language"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/listening%20to%20me","id":"Listening to me"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/urology","id":"urology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/understanding%20of%20patient's%20fears","id":"understanding of patient's fears"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety%20support","id":"anxiety support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health%20support","id":"mental health support"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/889417","id":"889417"}]},{"id":888878,"author":"allcolours497","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"I actually started to feel worse","body":"I went to A&E as I had sliced two of my fingers.  \r\nOn arrival at the Reception area, myself and a friend who had driven me, were informed in a rude manner to \"wait behind the sign\".

Issues with lack of follow up post appointment and what feels like disorganisation is unsettling for a first time to be mum.\n\nHaving been referred to the Barkantine from the start of my pregnancy, I went along to the initial appointment and left feeling taken care of after being given a time table of up and coming appointments and a name for my midwife.\n\nThe following appointments however were lacking. Some appointments that Id been promised, for example the 16 week midwife appointment and the group antenatal classes never transpired to anything despite me calling to chase for information and pre-registering my interest where needed.  \n\nI’d never been given the opportunity to see my midwife and spoken once over the phone for 5 minutes - leaving the feeling of a very impersonal service. \n\nHad issues with my gestational diabetes test, being told different information beforehand to help me prepare for the test and after being at the practice for around 3 hours to complete the test i left for home. I was then contacted by someone to say that they hadn’t noted me down as even coming in for the test and I’d need to rebook. This experience left me confused and concerned that’s my results would be mixed up for someone else’s or lost. Promised to then receive the results via telephone which I never did receive.\n\nIn addition to the confusing interactions and lack of communication, my GP surgery were not informed of my pregnancy. Upon attempting to book my 25 week midwife appointment they were advised that no record of my pregnancy was noted on the system. \n\nI have now transferred my care to another hospital due to a relocation and feel relieved to be under another trusts care.

Thank you too for the kindness shown during my stay on \nKingfisher Ward. A great team of nurses and supporting staff.  The consultant and anaesthesist also introduced themselves on the day of my surgery which demonstrated how they wanted me to feel comfortable with the procedure. \n\nOverall, I haven’t got enough words to say how well I was looked after and would like to say a huge thank you to everyone. A diamond in the middle of Ilford, with an amazing group of clinicians. I will definitely be recommending the Practice Plus Group Hospital to everyone I know.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2021-10-25T11:42:26","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-10-25T18:25:59","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/889472","id":"889472"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/889472/responses","id":"889472"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/889472/healthservices","id":"889472"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/889472/tags","id":"889472"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/ntp15","id":"NTP15","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/day%20surgery","id":"day surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/great","id":"great"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/group","id":"group"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hip","id":"hip"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hip%20replacement","id":"hip replacement"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/looked%20after","id":"looked after"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mobility","id":"mobility"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/oa","id":"OA"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/positive","id":"positive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/well%20looked%20after","id":"well looked after"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing","id":"amazing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/relieved","id":"relieved"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/comfortable","id":"comfortable"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/890050","id":"890050"}]},{"id":889498,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Terribly rude ","body":"Have been attending this surgery for 10 years for the most part its be OK. The past 4 years the receptionists have lost all telephone manners and are damn right rude and unhelpful at times. They lack communication, while implementing a 2 week system for taking bookings over lock down they were telling me this was still in place until today when I was made to feel it was my own fault for missing a hormone injection even though I've been ringing for 3 weeks and either can't get through (they're waiting on an engineer to fix phone lines) or am being told there's no availability. They can't explain what to expect as I've been on this hormone injection for 15years and have worries about coming off it through lack of availability. And for the past 5 years the Dr's have been brushing my symptoms of endometriosis away as IBS even though the symptoms don't match up.I have just registered with another practice, one where the receptionist was more than happy to talk to me and offered helpful suggestions instead of telling me to go all the way to Weymouth to book in at a sexual health clinic. Well done queen's avenue you work with people maybe try having personable people answering the phones, having applied for the receptionist role in the past I know you don't work exhaustive hours it's not tough to be nice for the small amount of time you are there.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2021-10-25T08:18:05","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-10-25T18:29:48","readBy":[{"name":"Ulster University, MBBS (Medicine) 2021","count":1},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2021)","count":3}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/889498","id":"889498"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/889498/responses","id":"889498"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/889498/healthservices","id":"889498"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/889498/tags","id":"889498"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/j81016","id":"J81016","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/endometriosis","id":"endometriosis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hormone","id":"hormone"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ibs","id":"IBS"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/injection","id":"injection"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sexual%20health","id":"sexual health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happy","id":"happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20happy","id":"not happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20happy","id":"very happy"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1003642","id":"1003642"}]}]
