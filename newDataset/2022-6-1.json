[{"id":943212,"author":"Bleather","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Excellent Care - NHS Fife Dietetic-Led IBS Service","body":"I requested to be referred to the Dietetic-Led IBS Service as I was having a lot of problems with my IBS symptoms. I had been recently diagnosed with the Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency (EPI) condition and put on enzymes replacement therapy by my GP.  \r\nThe dietician was amazing, a good listener and very supportive. He advised as a starting point to increase the enzymes and explained how they worked including when to increase them for example when eating a big meal. He also put me on a tablet that helped with the acid build. I almost instantly saw a difference in my condition and had less acid build up which had stopped me sleeping well and made my thirsty all the time.  \r\nI still had some IBS symptoms so the next step was to cut out wheat for 2 weeks. This was the main turning point for me as my IBS symptoms disappeared within 24 hours.  \r\nI have been discharged from this service as a pain free, happier, less stressed person who can do the normal things including not needing to find rest rooms in a hurry which was very stressful. Another benefit with using this service it has helped me to stay away from my GP and other health professionals as I am now feeling well and hardly have any IBS symptoms. I also have a better understanding of EPI and IBS and feel confident in managing my own symptoms. Please can you thank the dietician on my behalf?","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-05-30T08:24:35.6866667","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2022-06-01T08:17:38.84","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Fife","count":5},{"name":"Fife Health & Social Care Partnership","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/943212","id":"943212"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/943212/responses","id":"943212"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/943212/healthservices","id":"943212"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/943212/tags","id":"943212"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/f810h","id":"F810H","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/fifehscp-gps","id":"fifehscp-gps","score":5},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sf9-community-nutrition-dietetics","id":"SF9-community-nutrition-dietetics","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dietician","id":"Dietician"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/discharge","id":"discharge"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gp","id":"GP"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happier","id":"happier"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ibs","id":"IBS"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/less%20stressed","id":"less stressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/life%20changing","id":"life changing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain%20free","id":"pain free"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pancreas","id":"pancreas"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sleepless","id":"sleepless"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supportive","id":"supportive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thirsty","id":"thirsty"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/understanding","id":"understanding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing","id":"amazing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confident","id":"confident"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good%20listener","id":"good listener"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/healthy%20and%20happy","id":"Healthy and happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/explanations","id":"explanations"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thanks","id":"thanks"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/symptom%20management","id":"symptom management"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/well","id":"well"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/enzyme%20replacement%20therapy","id":"enzyme replacement therapy"}]},{"id":943368,"author":"Stewe96","authorRoleId":4,"authorRole":"a relative","title":"This officer is gifted and very talented","body":"I was around A/E and my mother was receiving treatment.

They had made a plan of proper treatment and investigation, unfortunately their shift got changed and the doctor who has took over have cancelled all plan and have told me according to them I have some stone in kidney due that was pain. The doctor will treat as UTI (Urinary Tract Infection) and advices me: please take this antibiotic and go home, keep taking a pain killers because nothing else I can do or see afterwards your GP.  \r\nIf my GP were very helpful I wouldn’t have gone to A&E, I was desperate for investigation and treatment .  \r\nI was left without option and I went home. The doctor didn’t took into consideration my diagnosis and how much I am exposed on risk due my diagnosis one of them is Lupus, also in discharge summary has written that they have given me oral IV (Intravenous) fluids which I have never received.  \r\nI was four days at home and my condition didn’t improve, even I have completed the course of the medication, then that night I went to A&E once more .  \r\nWhile booking my condition and informing of my pain level, no one took into consideration offering pain killer or seeing me earlier. I have seen people comes after myself and seen before me. Eventually Doctor called me after 5 hours long waiting, I was shocked of their behaviour and words, I found them extremely rude!  \r\nThe doctor have told me why I have come back to A&E? that is only for emergency and I should of gone to GP!  \r\nFirst full I have right of treatment, secondary the doctor shouldn’t spoken to me such a words or on that level. Instead of being carefully looking into my history of illness, diagnosis and present issue why I am at A&E and instead they should try to help me. The doctor was so rude and unhelpful to me. Most people who go to hospital especially A&E have something very painful, and I was not the only case. There was group of people which was experiencing same situations as me from same doctor, whoever the doctor seen doesn’t spend with the patient more than 5 minutes!  \r\nUnfortunately this website doesn’t allow to mention other people's names, otherwise surely I would mention the cases and names who there was sharing same experience as me.  \r\nI am raising this complaint not because NHS is a bad system but to ensure that someone senior on board to overlook what was going on during the patients time in the hospital.  \r\nIf each of them has been attended on time and treated as soon as he was seen.  \r\nSome patients who require blood test investigation need to be seen first and possibly explained that lab might take up to 1-2 hours for their results in order to make correct treatment.  \r\nI hope this will be noted and dealt with professionally. Should you require information about the above mentioned patients, it can be provided on your request so you can check your data records.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-05-28T03:30:23.1433333","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2022-06-01T08:44:54.77","readBy":[],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/942934","id":"942934"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/942934/responses","id":"942934"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/942934/healthservices","id":"942934"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/942934/tags","id":"942934"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rj611_180","id":"RJ611_180","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/terrified","id":"terrified"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/a&e%20waiting","id":"a&E waiting"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/abdomen","id":"abdomen"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20test","id":"blood test"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cancelled","id":"cancelled"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/desperate","id":"desperate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency","id":"emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gp","id":"GP"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/investigation","id":"investigation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kidney%20stone","id":"kidney stone"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lupus","id":"lupus"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/one%20doctor","id":"one doctor"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain%20relief","id":"pain relief"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/plan","id":"plan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/rude","id":"rude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/shift%20handover","id":"shift handover"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/test","id":"test"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unhelpful","id":"unhelpful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/uti","id":"uti"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/antibiotic","id":"antibiotic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctor%20attitude","id":"doctor attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/intravenous%20anti%20viral%20drugs","id":"intravenous anti viral drugs"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/everything%20explained","id":"everything explained"}]},{"id":942818,"author":"Rhonda77","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"I know they're busy but nobody called back!","body":"I had a letter saying after 6 months on the waiting list I could have some Physio on my knee , I phoned the number on the letter at my local hospital 2/3 times and no reply only a answerphone.

That was when I contacted my GP for a new inhaler because I had nothing left in my inhaler. When I called it was after 12pm and the recipient said they have no available appointments and I need to fill an online form (which usually take 48 hours for a prescription to be ready for collection). They said they will try for it to be ready as soon as possible.  \r\nBy the end of the day, I heard nothing from them. When it was about 12 am I couldn't handle the asthma anymore + I was a bit worried about what would happen if I needed it during my sleep. For the 5 nights before, I woke up during sleep with shortness of breath, so I called 111 which were so helpful. They ended up sending a taxi to pick me up. They asked for a covid rapid test which became positive, and they saw me directly and give me an inhaler after checking me. (I wish if knew the doctor's name so I can mention his name for being a real good doctor)  \r\nSo I went back home, and I was expecting maybe the next day I would receive a new prescription from my GP (which I didn't really want to go and collect because I already had a new inhaler) and if I didn't, I was guessing I would receive the new prescription on Monday. I didn't expect that I would receive a SMS the following day, saying I had requested salbutamol only 2 weeks after my last prescription was issued and suggesting I am overusing this medication. It said one inhaler should last around 6 months. and they were not issuing another inhaler. I was advised that if I felt unwell please give them a call today, and to make a nurse appointment for an asthma review.  \r\n*They refused to write a new prescription because my last prescription was before 2 weeks (which I don't think is true, but I think that it was more than 3 weeks). **They asked me to call and make an appointment (which I wasn't able to do the same day because it was already the afternoon, but I would need to wait until after the weekend and call before 11am - maybe I will get an appointment).***they didn't seem to think about what if I had a really bad asthma attack. What would have happened for myself and my kids if I have no inhaler at home. They could write a one inhaler prescription and send me an appointment or tell me that I need to make an appointment or they will not be able to help me next time I need new one.

He spent a bit longer than usual in the CAU because the hospital was very busy. The team there were great and my dad was very well looked after. My dad has chronic lung disease and suffered a tension pneumothorax requiring an emergency chest drain which had been traumatic and very painful. It had been a very scary experience.  \r\nMy dad was transferred to ward 5B one evening and you can imagine my horror when I received this text message:  \r\n\"I moved here at handover time and saw a daytime nurse who sat me in a seat next to my bed and said a night nurse would be along to help in a minute. Next nurse I saw was at 09:15 this morning. No meds, no sats, no care all night. No call button and calls for help ignored. Half extracted my drain trying to get into bed. Nightmare all round.\"My sister and I then couldn't get hold of dad and called the unit. My sister was greeted on the phone by a nurse who, when asked if our dad was on the ward, stated that they don't deal with chest drains. Trying to stay calm, my sister repeated that our father is on the ward? The nurse confirmed this but said they don't look after patients with chest drains so your dad was being transferred to the respiratory ward, 3B.From our telephone conversation it seemed to us that the lack of care and compassion my father had received overnight could be related to differing views on hospital policy, but unfortunately my dad was at the centre of this. We were very relieved when the staff in 3B took over dad's care and he was treated with the dignity and respect he deserves.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-05-23T20:23:46.5433333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-06-01T09:07:56.383","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Ayrshire & Arran","count":9}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/941501","id":"941501"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/941501/responses","id":"941501"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/941501/healthservices","id":"941501"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/941501/tags","id":"941501"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/a111h-cau","id":"A111H-CAU","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/a111h-hdu","id":"A111H-hdu","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/a111h-respiratory","id":"A111H-respiratory","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/angry","id":"angry"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frightened","id":"frightened"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helpless","id":"helpless"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lack%20of%20care","id":"Lack of care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sad","id":"sad"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/traumatic","id":"traumatic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/chest%20drain","id":"chest drain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lack%20of%20compassion","id":"lack of compassion"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lung%20disease","id":"lung disease"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/well%20looked%20after","id":"well looked after"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dignity","id":"Dignity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/great%20team","id":"great team"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/943948","id":"943948"}]},{"id":943427,"author":"Juli68","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Bad experience at emergency help","body":"I asked for help with heart pain and the risk of thrombosis.

She became Ill with schizophrenia 9 years ago and it has been a difficult time to learn to live with this illness, understand it, try to recover and access the correct services for her.  \r\nAlthough the staff are very helpful on this ward it is seriously understaffed, compared to some other wards I have found. There is a lack of privacy and some people like my daughter can spend years of their lives in a bed on a bay with five other patient and only a curtain for privacy Which is unbelievable as these patients are some of the most vulnerable in society. They have had to have their freedom taken away from them to keep them safe only to spend years locked up with no meaningful OT or rehabilitation services for them.  \r\nThis ward was only ever supposed to be a short term solution. I believe because the patients here have mental health illnesses they are put behind everyone else and as many of them don’t have a voice the trust can more easily ignore them. I have spent years visiting this ward and I do not feel it is a therapeutic environment. It seems more like a holding cell where people are medicated and put out again.  \r\nAs I said the staff are empathetic on the ward but I often wonder how they don’t burn out without more staff to be able to deliver adequate care. I think it’s depressing such wards still exist in 2022! The Ulster hospital has had major new builds throughout its grounds but I am not surprised, yet again, that the trust chooses to put these vulnerable and often very long term patients in the worst conditions. In my honest opinion it should have been knocked down many years ago.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-05-30T22:09:03.32","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-06-01T09:28:49.04","readBy":[{"name":"South Eastern Health and Social Care Trust","count":11}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/943370","id":"943370"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/943370/responses","id":"943370"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/943370/healthservices","id":"943370"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/943370/tags","id":"943370"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt004_07021-mhip","id":"ZT004_07021-mhip","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/accommodation","id":"accommodation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/depressed","id":"depressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/empathy","id":"empathy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lack%20of%20staff","id":"lack of staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/privacy","id":"privacy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/schizophrenia","id":"schizophrenia"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/943989","id":"943989"}]},{"id":943366,"author":"Mercat","authorRoleId":3,"authorRole":"a parent/guardian","title":"5month old in a&e","body":"My 5 month old had taken ill and we were taken by ambulance to swah hospital in Enniskillen.

This was by 4 different members of staff through triage etc. Should this not be streamlined - it seemed like a big waste of time.  \r\n2. I observed other patients waiting, asking for a drink but never receiving one.  \r\n3. I had a 5 month old in a&e breastfeeding. She was in pain, had temperatures and she needed care. I was there for approx 4 hours with no Calpol offered and stuck with all adults in a corridor.

Hadn`t used the Minor Injuries unit before and it really was excellent.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-05-31T08:55:56.4766667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-06-01T11:31:33.447","readBy":[{"name":"NHS 24","count":16},{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":5}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/943490","id":"943490"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/943490/responses","id":"943490"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/943490/healthservices","id":"943490"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/943490/tags","id":"943490"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/nhs24-111","id":"NHS24-111","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sj9-south-glasgow-hospital-minor-injury","id":"SJ9-south-glasgow-hospital-minor-injury","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/south-glasgow-hospital-accident","id":"south-glasgow-hospital-accident","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/antibiotics","id":"antibiotics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bite","id":"bite"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/efficiency","id":"efficiency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/excellent%20service","id":"excellent service"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/seen%20quickly","id":"seen quickly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tetanus","id":"tetanus"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/well%20looked%20after","id":"well looked after"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/injuries","id":"injuries"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/943972","id":"943972"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/944317","id":"944317"}]},{"id":943492,"author":"buick29","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"My semi-annual diabetes blood test","body":"Arrived for my blood sample to be drawn at appointed time.

I never felt alone and I was moved to the assessment centre to await my operation in the morning to get a stent inserted into my kidney. Throughout my treatment I received brilliant attention to detail and I want to thank the NHS for all their hard work & dedication. I had never had a general anaesthetic so I was reassured by my anaesthetist what would happen this was excellent advice & calmed me down. I recovered in Ward 4 under the brilliant Care of Staff Nurse Young & her staff who worked tirelessly attending all their patients with great patience & expertise. I cannot thank everyone enough as I indeed was feeling awful but now on my way to a very good recovery before my next procedure.  \r\nI have now received 3 appointments with Ms Bekarma the final one for laser treatment to the kidney stone this has been done in a timely manner & I feel I just had to write & add my great praise for all the staff who work for the NHS & Ayr Hospital - well done from a very grateful patient.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-05-31T09:24:35.56","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-06-01T11:39:57.92","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Ayrshire & Arran","count":8}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/943497","id":"943497"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/943497/responses","id":"943497"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/943497/healthservices","id":"943497"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/943497/tags","id":"943497"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/a210h_101","id":"A210H_101","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/a210h_180","id":"A210H_180","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/advice","id":"advice"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/attention%20to%20detail","id":"attention to detail"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/exceptional%20care","id":"Exceptional care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kidney%20stone","id":"kidney stone"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain%20relief","id":"pain relief"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/seen%20quickly","id":"seen quickly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supportive","id":"supportive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/urologist","id":"urologist"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/calm","id":"calm"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/patience","id":"patience"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/943987","id":"943987"}]},{"id":943547,"author":"gifttk66","authorRoleId":4,"authorRole":"a relative","title":"Professional and considerate ambulance crew","body":"Lukasz and Laura were the ambulance crew that attended our home when my daughter became suddenly unwell as she was suffering from covid.

Also people reported that when I became tired I started to slur my speech, something that I did not notice when it happened but generally I went to bed early when I felt tired in the evenings.  \r\nI was discharged back home with residual problems of dizziness and slightly impaired balance from this but I managed to look after my animals right from the start and together with my husband take my dog for walks almost daily.  \r\nI was booked in with a physiotherapist a few times who treated my dizziness and after about 4 weeks a speech therapist and her student came for an assessment, I think because my slurred speech was mentioned.  \r\nIt took two weeks from the point the appointment was made for her to come and I think I had improved more during that time. She did not make a formal assessment but had a long chat with me during which she also had a look at my lateral tongue movement which was a bit slow. Thankfully she found me completely clear and intelligible and didn't think that I had any language problems, so apart from an offer to get in touch if I have problems and the advice that speaking is the best exercise for my speech muscles, nothing else is needed as far as she is concerned.

I’m on holiday up in Scotland so I didn’t know where things were.  \r\nI was met by someone who just asked me what I needed and pointed me in the right direction (having asked me to sanitise my hands). So helpful as I have never been there before and was not fully focussed due to pain.I was told I may have a 3 hour wait to be seen. I heard him check up on me with reception as I was clearly in pain. He bought water to the people waiting. It’s a small gesture but really made a difference.It took around 3.5 hrs from walking in with a dislocated thumb in quite a bit of pain to walking out with a thumb in the right place in a splint with minimal pain. That is just amazing.Lovely staff took all my details and helped me find the proper address of the holiday home we were staying in. I only waited around 45 mins to be seen. The nurses talked through everything they were doing and gave me a full check up in case I’d hurt any thing else. I moved quickly to radiology and then back to MIU. The wait seemed short between each different service. They talked me through the problem, the pain relief options and helped me understand the different sensations so I knew that it had worked properly. My thumb didn’t want to pop back into place but there was no panic, no fluster just calm explanation and getting the job sorted as quickly and with as little pain as possible. Audrey and Kat were the main carers and they were just fantastic. Thank you so much. They put me at ease, made sure I was as comfortable as possible and really looked after me. I always felt I was in safe hands.I struggle to think how the service could be better.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-05-31T08:32:57.1166667","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2022-06-01T12:05:57.513","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Forth Valley","count":3}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/943488","id":"943488"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/943488/responses","id":"943488"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/943488/healthservices","id":"943488"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/943488/tags","id":"943488"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/stirling-ch-miu","id":"stirling-ch-miu","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/carers","id":"Carers"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dislocated","id":"dislocated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helpful","id":"helpful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/informed","id":"informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/looked%20after","id":"looked after"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lovely%20staff","id":"lovely staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/minor%20injuries","id":"minor injuries"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain%20relief","id":"pain relief"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/radiology","id":"radiology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/safe","id":"safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thumb","id":"thumb"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/welcomed","id":"welcomed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/calm","id":"calm"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fantastic","id":"fantastic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/explanations","id":"explanations"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/quick%20procedure","id":"quick procedure"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/radiology%20department","id":"Radiology department"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/check%20up","id":"check up"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20at%20ease%20by%20staff","id":"put at ease by staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/comfortable","id":"comfortable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain%20relief%20options","id":"pain relief options"}]},{"id":943990,"author":"Dignified","authorRoleId":4,"authorRole":"a relative","title":"Dignity","body":"The first thing that comes to mind is Dignity.

My CGL worker got in touch with Stacy from the rehab program 'Offender to rehab' and they worked together to get me in to a rehab centre where I completed my detox and rehab program.  \r\nI have been free from drug and alcohol dependency, for 42 days and that is an amazing achievement that I honestly never thought would be possible!  \r\nI have now got my family, my health and my life back.  \r\nThere would be no way I would of been able to do this without my CGL worker Katy, she has been there for me through the whole process and never gave up on me and is still supporting me now.  \r\nI am also really thankful to Stacy from west midland police who helped me gain access in to the rehab centre.  \r\nKaty and Stacy have worked together to give me all the support I needed to get me through the journey  \r\nI am so thankful for all the support I have received  \r\nI hope that others can be inspired by my story and know that recovery is possible!","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-05-31T12:35:23.17","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-06-01T12:54:40.647","readBy":[{"name":"Change Grow Live","count":3}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/943564","id":"943564"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/943564/responses","id":"943564"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/943564/healthservices","id":"943564"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/943564/tags","id":"943564"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/nms-cglb-central-west","id":"nms-cglb-central-west","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/alcohol","id":"alcohol"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/alcohol%20addiction","id":"alcohol addiction"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/crack","id":"crack"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/detox","id":"detox"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/drinking","id":"drinking"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/drug%20addiction","id":"drug addiction"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/heroin","id":"heroin"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/keyworker","id":"keyworker"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/methadone","id":"methadone"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/recovery","id":"recovery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing","id":"amazing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported","id":"supported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thankful","id":"Thankful"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/945262","id":"945262"}]},{"id":943503,"author":"PRW64","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"I was blessed to be under their care","body":"The care and compassion of my speech and language therapist requesting I come back after noticing a change in my voice in a voice message, led her to identify that I had a stroke.

They continued to reinforce that things would improve. Naturally I also would like to thank the neurology staff who helped me see light at the end of the tunnel and with whom I am currently engaged. Having identified something was not just right they have been diligent in offering me time and space to come to terms with potential changes .  \r\nFurthermore the number of tests I undertook was amazing, all intended to give the clinical staff a steer in what I was encountering, and all those involved in carrying out those procedures, from the staff who took me to and from scans and x-rays to the staff who carried them out were exemplary.  \r\nAll those staff I encountered whilst working in challenging conditions , always had time for a word, to check, are you ok?, is there anything you need?, a smile, an acknowledgement of my situation, a reassurance.

I felt overwhelmed by the pressure and completely hopeless.  \r\nI had to leave. I didn't go back for five months.  \r\nI stayed in bed most of the day getting up sometime before my evening meal. I couldn't be bothered to wash half the time and when I did finally get up I sat on the settee and watched telly before going back to bed.  \r\nI couldn't bring myself to go out and I stopped my social life in fear of having a breakdown when I was out. I didnt even go in the garden. I felt...what is the point of me. (I I didn't feel suicidal but I did think if something happened to me and I died that'd be fine.  \r\nI started therapy, which I I totally believed would be of no help at all!  \r\nWell I was completely wrong. Yes it was hard and sometimes I felt felt over whelmed by the information. ( This was the first part of online webinars)  \r\nOnce I started the therapy and engaged with the tasks I began to come alive. I could feel the progress. Each task I tried to follow up as best as I could. I began not to cry every day. I do still cry but that's ok and it's not so so much these days and it's not daily.  \r\nWorking on stopping my unhelpful thought was great. I still have the sheet at home and one at work. I'm sure we all do it... Think we know what someone else is thinking. Now I tell myself I'm not a mind reader.  \r\nI have a timetable (I know it doesn't work for everyone) I have put exercise on it for every day even if it is just a walk around the block or even the garden I try my best to do it. I don't beat myself up if I haven't, I refelected on what I have done over a week.  \r\nGet a big task I need to do and avoiding it... This is now changed to making it achievable . Breaking it down to thd tiniest parts and then achieving one little step . That way you achieve all the time and begin to feel proud of the steps.  \r\nI know it's not a miracle cure. I will keep checking in regulary, giving myself space to think about my achievements . I will add in more, extend my exercise time.  \r\nI know im going forward.  \r\nTake the plunge and begin to swim into life.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-06-01T09:50:20.5133333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-06-01T13:12:45.937","readBy":[{"name":"Midlands Partnership NHS Foundation Trust","count":8}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/943944","id":"943944"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/943944/responses","id":"943944"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/943944/healthservices","id":"943944"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/943944/tags","id":"943944"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rrex4-inclusion-thurrock","id":"rrex4-inclusion-thurrock","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/exercise","id":"exercise"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/overwhelmed","id":"overwhelmed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/recovery","id":"recovery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/therapy","id":"therapy"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/945320","id":"945320"}]},{"id":944014,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"So helpful!","body":"Needed a prescription urgently.

I was terrified that I would get some kind of health complications down the line, and I was really hard on myself. But as soon as she confirmed my suspicions, she settled me right down. It was something about her energy that soothed the pain. She explained that a huge majority of people contract it through their lifetime, making (professional) jokes to lighten the mood. She was a joy to chat with, and I had never had such little pain/aftermath from somebody taking bloods.  \r\nShe had even explained, in depth, how I should do every single screening test. 5 years and not a single nurse had explained that I needed to put the first bit of pee into the urine cup! Just a month before, I had seen a different nurse, who accidentally left a bruise on my arm. I was terrified to have my bloods done at Cobridge again. But when Fiona did it, I didn't even feel it go in or out, and she even managed to talk to me during the blood taking.  \r\nAn absolutely inspiring woman!

He presented at A&E at the specified time and was seen very promptly by a nurse, who he says was one of the nicest people he has ever met (her name was Norma I believe). He struggles with anxiety but Norma put him completely at ease and within an hour and a half he had been examined, sent for an x-ray, diagnosed, put in plaster and sent on his way with pain relief, information and advice about self care and safe in the knowledge that a further appointment would come through in the next couple of weeks. This did happen and he was back having a further x-ray and a new cast fitted as the follow up showed damage to his scaphoid.  \r\nThe whole experience to date has been really good and I would recommend that calling NHS24 when you don't have a life threatening condition is far better than turning up at A&E and having to sit for a long period of time. The appointment system meant he was seen promptly and this hopefully also eased pressure on staff in A&E. Well done to everyone involved but a special mention to Norma who really went above and beyond in making my son comfortable and at ease during his visit.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-05-31T14:29:19.4366667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-06-01T13:21:15.553","readBy":[{"name":"NHS 24","count":15},{"name":"NHS Borders","count":5}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/943614","id":"943614"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/943614/responses","id":"943614"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/943614/healthservices","id":"943614"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/943614/tags","id":"943614"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/b120h_ucc","id":"B120H_UCC","score":5},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/nhs24-111","id":"NHS24-111","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/above%20and%20beyond","id":"above and beyond"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/advice","id":"advice"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/broken%20wrist","id":"broken wrist"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly%20staff","id":"friendly staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/no%20waiting","id":"no waiting"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain%20relief","id":"pain relief"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/plaster","id":"plaster"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/x-ray","id":"X-ray"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20at%20ease","id":"put at ease"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/caring%20team","id":"caring team"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/944028","id":"944028"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/944055","id":"944055"}]},{"id":944021,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Excellent help by receptionists","body":"I called the practice to seek help in obtaining a Covid Vaccination Passport.

was very in depth, allowing me to ask questions, and putting me at ease, she covered all bases, and I left with all the information that I needed to know for my procedure.\n\nThe Nurse was very competent, polite, and put my mind at ease by giving me all the information that I required about the procedures, their processes, and the results at the end.\n\nI was then allowed to get change in a clean area, with fresh clean hospital shorts, gown, and dressing gown.\n\nI was then collected by another Nurse, who was amazing, she straight away made me feel like everything was going to be ok.\n\nShe advised me around pain relief, cannular, the procedures, she introduced me to the doctor, and the other Nurse that would be helping me, she was a calming professional, and  made me feel very comfortable, talking me all the way through the Endoscopy and Colonoscopy, what was happening and why.\n\nI felt reassured, calm, and was feeling very comfortable with the way the Nurses and doctor treated me, with respect, dignity, and professionalism.\n\nI was informed of all the different observations, and my mind was put at ease.\n\nAfter the procedures, I was taken to the recovery Ward, and another Nurse, once again kind, polite and very professional, did all her checks and I was then allowed to prepare for discharge.\n\nA young nurse kindly gave me tea and biscuits followed by discharge by another Nurse, who went through all the relevant the paperwork in a calm, professional and polite way, told me what the doctors had found via the procedures, and I was informed nothing sinister was discovered which gave me a great a relief and happiness, as I was very worried that it may turn out to be something dangerous.\n\nI thanked the nurses and overall my personal experience

Over 48hrs after now & need to tell my story. I do not want to scare anyone but my story is not unique and I don’t wish this experience on anyone. It should not be allowed to happen in 2022.  \r\nI am in my mid thirties (no kids) & spent the last 1 year+ having appointments and investigations for bleeding between excruciating, heavy periods. The past year was full of issues with missing referrals, and then my pathway documents being lost by the hospital.  \r\nI spent much time on the phone chasing up on my care the past year and already had little trust in the clinic (Salford Royal Gynae with it’s peeling walls, mismatched chairs, underfunded aesthetic). I was glad to be going in to remove what was likely a 2cm benign polyp & was hopeful this hysteroscopy would be the final simple procedure. When I finally received my pamphlet (the day before!) it was like the advice I had read online from healthcare professionals. It advised to take the pain relief before, that I might experience cramp like pains, I can go straight back to work, recovery 1-2 days if biopsy is taken. I feel it was grossly downplayed! I turned up alone (mistake), gave a urine sample and sat in a waiting room to listen to the radio. I was feeling a bit nervous never having had a hysteroscopy before but the nurse who came to walk me into the room seemed happy and breezy. I thought... can’t be too bad. I entered the room which looked like a large doctors office but with a stirrup chair, curtains and lots of equipment around it. I was telling myself, surely something done in this environment cannot be that bad. The Dr was lovely and chatty, read through a form and I signed. They said I could have a local anaesthetic to the cervix and even though I said oh I’m absolutely fine with injections/dentists, have a high pain threshold etc they firmly stated that it would likely be more painful having the injection than just going through it (alarm bells!). I was then asked by a 2nd nurse to change behind a curtain to put on a gown then straight into the chair to be positioned. My heart started racing at this point (natural I thought) and then all of a sudden the doctor was talking, cleaning the outside, a speculum went in then cleaning the inside. All the time the 2 nurses were asking me questions and I was chatting nervously away making jokes and then it happened. The next part is burned into my brain moment by moment. I wanted to scream & cry looking up at the illustrations on the ceiling (I never ever want to see the book they were from anywhere again). I tried to keep talking sentences but I couldn’t, I couldn’t breathe, I felt out of body at times. I remember looking at the screen and forcing myself to try and listen to what they were saying while I felt every movement, a pain I can’t even describe (I’ve had to have morphine in the past for painful injuries and this pain was even higher than those incidences). The Dr said the polyp was a mix with a fibroid and I could see it was large (in the space between my left and right tube) they asked if they could try take more away & I couldn’t believe this was even suggested! I said no please stop. When I was told it was over I was shaking, cold, shivery & hot at the same time. I joked about not being able to stand up when I was left to get myself off the bed & felt I might vomit. Once changed they sat me down & I signed a form for a general anesthetic (shaking throughout). I was in a state of shock for the next few hours. I sat in the post procedure waiting room where you are left & forgotten about with your hot drink & biscuit, phoned my family, chatting away about it all in a false it was horrible but hey ho voice. Then tried to walk to the pharmacy & was shocked to find I could only shuffle to pick up 2 medications for my periods before the GA. I feel people should be advised they must bring someone with them, I’m a fitness fanatic and this shocked me to feel so weak. Also, this is the first time since I raised my symptoms over a year ago that I have been offered any medication). Every step was agony in my womb, taking my breath away, I had to keep stopping. The taxi home, every bump was agony & I’m still in pain today & bleeding (again had been given misinformation that it’s just a little spotting) and can’t walk properly.I don't think even 1 single woman should be made to to go through this procedure awake! It's quite simply barbaric. The worst part; I feel like I felt when I was raped by a \"nice\" man when I was younger. Especially as I now believe that one of the likely reasons for the Dr and his assistants being so nice and chatty was because they are fully aware of the indescribable pain this procedure can cause women. I spent that evening awake at midnight crying hysterically having flashbacks of what happened. This is not like me. Why did everyone seem so nonchalant during the procedure? I know they are trying to keep you calm but I find it impossible they are not aware that this was trauma pain, I must have been white as a sheet and shaking, why was my blood pressure/heart rate not monitored? Where was the gas & air that you get in A&E? Why is it so downplayed and why are women expected to bear this! I have since read hundreds of stories of other women saying it’s worse than childbirth & even a campaign to end painful Hysteroscopies entirely. I want people to know that they can demand a General Anaesthetic if they have to!","criticality":"strongly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-05-29T20:29:48.96","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2022-06-01T15:13:33.613","readBy":[{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2022)","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/943181","id":"943181"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/943181/responses","id":"943181"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/943181/healthservices","id":"943181"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/943181/tags","id":"943181"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rm301_502","id":"RM301_502","score":2},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/shocked","id":"shocked"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/traumatic","id":"traumatic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/access%20to%20pain%20relief","id":"access to pain relief"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/agony","id":"agony"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/alarmed","id":"alarmed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/biopsy","id":"biopsy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breathing%20difficulties","id":"breathing difficulties"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cervix","id":"cervix"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cold","id":"cold"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctor","id":"doctor"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/facilities","id":"facilities"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fibroid","id":"fibroid"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly%20staff","id":"friendly staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gynae","id":"gynae"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/horrified","id":"horrified"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hysteroscopy","id":"hysteroscopy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/information","id":"information"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/local%20anaesthetic","id":"local anaesthetic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/periods","id":"periods"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/polyp","id":"polyp"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/timely","id":"timely"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/transparency","id":"Transparency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/womb","id":"womb"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/weak","id":"weak"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/misinformation","id":"misinformation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/painful%20procedure","id":"painful procedure"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/jokes","id":"jokes"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/shaken","id":"shaken"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/offered%20general%20anaesthetic","id":"offered general anaesthetic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/questions%20asked","id":"questions asked"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/flashbacks","id":"flashbacks"}]}]
