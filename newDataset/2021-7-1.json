I must admit i wasn't expecting the high level i received. From start to finish i was told what to expect and what to do next. My examination was a little uncomfortable, but the nurses reassured me while gently rubbing my shoulder. My consultant made me feel that my problems were valid and gave me a plan of what was to come. They also put me in immediately for a blood test and advised of medication.  Even the nurse who took my bloods advised against a vein i suggested as it would be more uncomfortable. Many thanks.

I was in a very anxious and upset state and was very worried about my health/condition.  On arrival we saw a paramedic (rude man not wearing a mask), the first thing he said was ‘you can’t come in sir!’ to my husband, while waving his hand in a rude manner. I fully understand the covid rules and why my husband wasn’t allowed in but this was totally unnecessary and unprofessional. He then said ‘why have they sent you here? You shouldn’t be here.’  He sent me to another door saying they probably wouldn’t see me. At the second door, zero covid compliance was in place; no masks were worn by door staff. I had to request to sanitise my hands. Many staff standing around talking; some even watching the football on their phones. Triage nurse was rude and ignored me, doctor didn’t know what to do with me and walked off leaving me in the cubicle for an hour and a half. The cubicle had blood on the floor and examination couch, which did little to ease my anxiety. A good clean wouldn’t go amiss! Staff didn’t know what was going on with/for me as that doctor had then finished his shift. I was put in another waiting room where zero covid restrictions were in place. I felt very unsafe covid-wise and was in a lot of pain and feeling very anxious. Where is the care? Absolutely disgusting. I know that these people are busy but honestly this was a horrendous experience. I am a human being who was in pain and distress. If this is the treatment available, it’s a very sad state.

Unlike last time I was here partners are now permitted to stay overnight in a chair which is lovely  especially for first time parents. There are 4 bays. Two of us have partners with us, two don’t (I’m alone as my husband is home with our other children). Unfortunately there seem to be no rules whatsoever about night time hours on wards. The man next to me was watching a film on his phone and munching on snacks at midnight. The woman opposite has conducted 3 noisy non-urgent non-important telephone conversations on loudspeaker between 12:30am & 6:00am. I firmly believe that people should be given some “ward etiquette” information upon admission. Such as no non-urgent phone calls between 10pm and 7am. No watching tv on your phone after 10pm unless you have headphones. Thinking of your fellow patients and trying to be mindful that others are trying to rest and recover at night. I completely understand that wards are always going to be noisy with babies crying, snoring, medications being distributed and observations carried out 24/7. But it seems people need reminding how to behave and to consider others, it’s deeply frustrating as a patient trying to sleep. Also since I can’t get off the bed (catheter) it’s a bit difficult to complain to staff about people who you’re only separated from by a curtain. I’m in a maternity ward trying to recover from a surgical birth and I really resent being kept awake by a bloke who wants to kick back, eat crisps and watch a film in the early hours.

I was now in considerable discomfort, passing blood a lot, in pain, struggling to eat and sleep etc.  \r\nI had been sent a referral letter which had the wrong reference on it. On a Monday in June 2021 I decided to go to the hospital to try to get some answers (N&N in norwich). I went to A&E and explained my situation and the people at the door felt I should go in and be seen.  \r\nThe first Doctor on duty who saw me, made me feel like a complete hypochondriac and had me in tears. Even the nurse commented that they were in the wrong profession. I battled on and was seen. I then got my colonoscopy appointment through for July as a result of my going in that day.  \r\nBy the following Wednesday I was so bloated, looked about 6 months pregnant, had back pain, my knees were starting to give way intermittently and I called my doctor on the Thursday saying that I could not go on as I was. my movements of blood and mucus were about 20 plus times a day. Thankfully he saw me and sent me straight into the AMU to go straight to the gastro ward for my camera and x-ray. I went in good faith and was so grateful to now be in the system and feel I was getting somewhere. I had the camera on my left hand side on the Friday morning.. with no pain relief or sedation whatsoever.. my sister in law who is a gastro consultant was absolutely horrified.  \r\nI was screaming and crying in SO much distress and pain (childbirth was way easier with no pain relief).. I eventually got some gas and air but they couldn't carry on and said they’d seen the big inflammation so knew they could treat me on steroids. And wait for full colonoscopy in July. I was absolutely traumatised by this and then went on to have failed cannulas which couldn’t go into my vein (still very bruised days later).. used my same vein for all the many bloods taken (still incredibly bruised to the point i asked if perhaps they could find another vein or arm!?) they put a cannula in the top of my hand which is fine but so painful and then proceeded to take my blood pressure all from this same left arm, my veins were stinging and throbbing.. it really is basic common sense and I had to keep asking/reminding for it to be taken in my other arm.  \r\nThe steroids were pushed into my cannula so quickly and stung me so badly (depending on which nurse I had)….. it was just all so awful, I spent most of my four nights sobbing, feeling harrowed, triggered from a past abuse I’d had .. bruised inside out and mentally. Some of the staff were so lovely and I honestly feel that they just don’t have the time to care .. it’s so sad.  \r\nI was very lucky to have my own room which was a saving grace. I really hope others do not have to go through this. And both the consultants I saw were just so sad that I had had to suffer for so long and got lost in the covid system. The discharging consultant was so sorry about my experience in A&E and congratulated me so much on getting myself there and to this point. They think it is suspected crohn’s or ulcerative colitis but I am still waiting over 10 days after my biopsies which I was told would be a week for the results. I didn’t get to see a doctor for the whole weekend I was there despite being told on the Saturday that they were coming back to see me and at a 10 pm when I couldn’t stay awake I asked are they coming and they said, no I’m sorry they aren't……  \r\nI could go on but that’s some of it.. and one nurse wouldn’t even look up and get me my water, I needed it as blood pressure was reading low.. so I went back and asked them where the tap was so I could do it myself.. they eventually got up and was so grumpy and unpleasant in their nature and attitude.  \r\nThank you and I hope you can prevent others from having an experience like this and I am lucky that despite feeling so weak and broken that I engineered being seen. My GP is really sorry too. I had only come off anti depressants in april after 11yrs and am amazed not to be on them but determined not to be too!.  \r\nthank you and best wishes","criticality":"moderately

user","title":"Our deepest and heartfelt thanks","body":"As a result of a complication in pregnancy, the safest option for baby and I was to be induced early.  \r\nI nervously attended DOU at Royal Victoria Hospital, maternity where I was met with the friendliest big smile from Midwife Nicola who reassured me and immediately put me at ease with the beginning of the induction process.  \r\nFollowing this, I attended the induction of labour suite where I was cared for by Sr Victoria and team. The induction suite, despite the business of the environment had such a chilled-out atmosphere which greatly helped to relieve anxieties.  \r\nWhen the time came for me to be transferred to the delivery suite, my husband and I were transferred round by the lovely Midwife Deirbhle. Deirbhle listened attentively to all my wishes and went above and beyond to ensure that these were met as much as possible.  \r\nWe were then cared for by Midwife Kirsty. Like Deirbhle, Kirsty too listened to all our wishes, answered endless questions, ensured that all our requests were met in a kind and courteous manner. After asking Kirsty about an epidural, we were soon met by anaesthetic Dr McCarter. Dr McCarter was calm and reassuring and ensured that I was soon a lot more comfortable!  \r\nFollowing some complications, Dr McCorkindale quickly arrived. I was extremely nervous at the thought of medical interventions, however, everything was explained perfectly to my husband and I, and I soon knew I was in the best of hands to help my little one arrive into the world safely. Dr McCorkindale was just exceptional.  \r\nDr McCorkindale was assisted by Midwives Claire, Lavelle and Teresa who were all so warm and kind.  \r\nI required a longer stay in the delivery suite due to complications. I was so impressed with the continuity of care as I was then looked after again by Midwife Deirbhle. I was very poorly and Deirbhle helped me so much, from reminding me to feed my baby, to making tea and toast for my husband and I- and everything inbetween!  \r\nOur deepest and heartfelt thanks to all of those mentioned above. We are truly grateful for the wonderful care that we received.  \r\nAlso our extended thanks to the entire teams on the ward rounds, and to those whose names we regretfully failed to catch.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-06-28T17:53:18.2766667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-07-01T10:44:03.923","readBy":[{"name":"Belfast Health and Social Care Trust","count":12}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/858276","id":"858276"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/858276/responses","id":"858276"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/858276/healthservices","id":"858276"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/858276/tags","id":"858276"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt001-rgh-day-obs-unit","id":"zt001-rgh-day-obs-unit","score":5},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt001-rgh-delivery-suite","id":"zt001-rgh-delivery-suite","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nervous","id":"nervous"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/above%20and%20beyond","id":"above and beyond"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anaesthetic","id":"Anaesthetic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20about","id":"Cared about"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/continuity","id":"continuity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/courteous","id":"courteous"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/delivery","id":"delivery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/epidural","id":"epidural"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helped","id":"helped"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/induction%20of%20labour","id":"Induction of labour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kind","id":"kind"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/labour","id":"labour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/listened","id":"listened"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/maternity","id":"maternity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/midwives","id":"midwives"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pregnancy","id":"pregnancy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20friendly","id":"Very friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/warmth","id":"warmth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wonderful%20care","id":"wonderful care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/calm","id":"calm"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20for","id":"cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/impressed","id":"impressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassuring","id":"reassuring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/explanations","id":"explanations"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20ease","id":"at ease"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thanks","id":"thanks"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/calm%20atmosphere","id":"calm atmosphere"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/exceptional%20staff","id":"exceptional staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/initially%20worried","id":"initially worried"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/induction%20ward","id":"induction ward"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/questions%20answered","id":"questions answered"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/859230","id":"859230"}]},{"id":858579,"author":"R.Paterson","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"I had an operation to remove a Basil Carcinoma","body":"This is the fourth or fifth time I have had this procedure done and was aware of how the operation would be carried out.

Tight cough pain in my chest which I managed till the morning. I booked a PCR test for 10am.  \r\nOn return I felt unwell and I was concerned that because I couldn’t cough properly due to the sharp pain it would cause me further issues. I called the 111 number which stated that the call is for people who need urgent help, at this point I did not feel I needed urgent help and as a nurse I felt my symptoms could be managed by a GP.  \r\nI called my GP surgery and asked for advice I explained that I had asthma, that I had a terrible sharp pain in my chest on coughing and asked what advice are they giving or a recommendation for medication. I was met with the reply asking a prescription for what. I told the receptionist I have just explained why. They then proceeded to tell me a GP would not see me. I told them I understood a GP would not see me however I would like a telephone consultation to which they replied fine.  \r\nThis was all through struggling to talk due to a sore throat and painful cough. I waited 4 and half hours for a call back. When I didn’t receive a call back I called the surgery to find out when I would get to speak to a dr. I deliberately gave my house number as we have had issues in the past with calls to mobiles. I called 80 times which is visible on my phone whenever I pressed the appropriate number to get through the call dropped. I then changed and opted for another option this dropped too.  \r\nI then went through the house call option and I tried to explain there is an issues with their telephone system. The receptionist was rude and said I would just need to keep trying as they are in the process of transferring their phone system. Again I tried to explain I had tried 80 times and I thought it was ridiculous they are changing over a phone system and people are trying to get help. They then took my name and said they Dr has tried called several times and they had no answer. Now my husband is an IT engineer he checked the phone and it was working he also withheld his number and tried and it was working.  \r\nThe receptionist then told me I needed to get off the line and they would inform the dr. I said I am calling for help I have been waiting for 4.5hrs in pain and I think it’s ridiculous that patients are being treated like this because they have COVID symptoms. At this point I became upset and crying as I was being met by someone completely unsympathetic. I explained that I am a nurse and I never use my GP service unless I need help and I am unable to get that help when required. It seemed very clear that this person didn’t care. I have 2 young children with the possibility of having covid and I was frightened, my oldest daughter (8) was becoming frightened and all I wanted was someone to listen to my symptoms and possible prescribe steroids due to my asthma. I told this person I was about to call NHS 24 and report this carry on that they should be dealing with patients and their response was and what are they going to do, I also said it needs reporting to the department of health.  \r\nMy husband heard the full conversation and took the phone from me. He was angry and asked for the receptionist name which they never gave due to my husband and being angry they hung up. My husband called again and spoke to someone who seemed to help a bit more, and informed us of their colleague's name. I then took the decision to call 111 where I was assessed and called back by a GP who was extremely helpfully who prescribed steroids and gave me another prescription for my inhaler. During this call the GP called to say that they had been trying to call and the call wasn’t going through. I explained that my landline is completely working I think it’s a bit of a coincidence that they were changing phone systems and calls were unable to connect.  \r\nI am really disappointed that I have been treated in the way. I never access my GP unless I have to and I was met with this response. Reception staff acted unsympathetic and they are not upholding NHS Lanarkshire values. I work in hospital where staff are dealing with covid everyday face to face yet I can’t get help from a GP over the phone. I think community services is a sorry state of affairs and A&Es are full because patients can’t get access to a GP service when needed.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-06-28T16:20:05.6133333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-07-01T12:41:44.753","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lanarkshire","count":2},{"name":"Scottish Government","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/858234","id":"858234"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/858234/responses","id":"858234"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/858234/healthservices","id":"858234"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/858234/tags","id":"858234"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sl9-gp","id":"sl9-gp","score":1},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/angry","id":"angry"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/badly%20let%20down","id":"badly let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disappointed","id":"disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frightened","id":"frightened"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/should%20listen","id":"Should listen"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20upset","id":"very upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/access%20to%20gp","id":"access to GP"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appointment%20system","id":"appointment system"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/asthma","id":"asthma"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/chest","id":"chest"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/chest%20pain","id":"chest pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/concerned","id":"concerned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cough","id":"cough"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/face","id":"face"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/inhaler","id":"inhaler"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/phone%20system","id":"phone system"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sore%20throat","id":"sore throat"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sympathetic","id":"sympathetic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/terrible","id":"terrible"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/test","id":"test"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/throat","id":"throat"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20concerned","id":"very concerned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20disappointed","id":"very disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fine","id":"fine"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid","id":"covid"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/crying","id":"crying"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%2019","id":"covid 19"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/861103","id":"861103"}]},{"id":858607,"author":"staceysigns","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Fibroids.... the never ending battle","body":"In 2017 I was diagnosed with 2 small fibroids. These didn't cause me too many issues at the time. However, over the years they grew and more symptoms and issues have become an added challenge in my life. In 2019 things became apparent that they were getting worse, and worse in 2020, and even more so now than ever. I feel like I have seen doctors, again and again, to tell me what \"could happen\" to help, but those things never happen.  \r\nI have shared with the doctors that due to cancer, which is hormonal related, in my family, I didn't want to go on hormones to \"improve\" things. One particular Dr. throughout this process has been the most difficult to deal with. They have people that work under them, and the first person I met was great. There was no follow-up, however, and everything that has happened since has been because I chased it. This Dr. has made me feel unheard, that my issues were minor and that they are unable to help me, particularly because of COVID-19 and not seeing patients face to face. Each conversation we have had their tone has been condescending and rushed.  \r\nToday, I know that one of the fibroids is just about 10 CM. It is pushing on my bladder and my spinal cord, which is creating a form of sciatica in my leg. It causes disrupted sleep, pressure on the pelvic area, low libido (particularly due to the pain during intercourse), back pain, painful periods, cramps, bloating, and heavy bleading. Over the years, I have been told I just need to lose weight- I am an active individual who goes to the gym 3 x. a week, walks 2x a day, hikes on weekends, and eats a homemade healthy diet. I used to be a runner, and now I can't run due to the pressure on the bladder and the fact that running makes me pee myself- not a good look. I could go on.  \r\nI have been patient, awaiting letters and following the system. Trusting that it will be ok and that the surgery that I should be scheduled for will happen. Over the last few weeks, I have felt worse and decided I should call the gynecology department and let them know and seek some guidance. The doctor did phone me back last week, which I missed due to work, and they followed up as they said they would today. Immediately on the phone, I got the same impression that I normally get- fobbed off, unheard, and basically spoken to in a tone of pure condescension. They accused me of being anxious about wanting to know when the surgery would be yes, I am curious, but the real reason for my call is that I am currently in pain. They told me I should go to my GP because my pain could be something else- sure it Could be something else, but I know that its the same pain, just worse. Not to mention, every time I have gone to the GP, they basically can't help me and need to then send me back to the gynaecologist. Apparently, the GP can \"assess\" if it's urgent. Circles... the system just puts me in a never-ending loop.  \r\nThis Dr. has read me notes, not remembered my name, my case, and seems to have no clue as to what is going on with me as their patient. Patient Centred Care does not seem a priority. In fact, when we did speak in early June this doctor asked me questions about the conversation that I had with the surgeon- questions that they should have answers to, or be able to find out, answers that I didn't have (e.g. did the surgeon want more imaging, did I need medication before surgery and when that should be started). First, I am not a medical doctor, and second by asking me these questions reaffirms that you have no clue what is going on in my case.  \r\nThe surgeon I spoke to told me that the position and size (\" a whopper\") was worth removing. I spoke to someone else as well, and asked if I could be on both waiting lists- one for the embolisation, one for surgery- as hey, getting any procedure is better than none. Apparently you are not allowed to be on two lists. Nor is there a clear system of care when you are dealing with an issue that people don't seem to care about, it won't kill me, so who cares about my quality of life? So I continue to wait, for the surgery, as if I can get it removed then hopefully this is the last time I have to deal with this unit. We don't know how long the wait will be... how many more months/years I don't know. I am only 37, can't imagine having kids now after carrying a tumour for so long, and struggle to see the point of healthcare, when they don't show any care.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-06-29T14:08:50.6","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-07-01T13:17:38.043","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lothian","count":5},{"name":"Scottish Government","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/858607","id":"858607"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/858607/responses","id":"858607"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/858607/healthservices","id":"858607"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/858607/tags","id":"858607"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/s314h_502","id":"S314H_502","score":1},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxious","id":"anxious"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dissatisfied","id":"dissatisfied"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frustrated","id":"frustrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hopeless","id":"Hopeless"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back%20pain","id":"back pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/belittled","id":"belittled"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bladder","id":"bladder"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cramps","id":"cramps"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/end%20of%20life","id":"end of life"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/face","id":"face"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fibroids","id":"fibroids"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/follow%20up","id":"follow up"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hurt","id":"hurt"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/imaging","id":"imaging"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/leg","id":"leg"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/patient-centred","id":"patient-centred"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pelvic","id":"pelvic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pelvic%20pain","id":"pelvic pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/periods","id":"periods"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/read%20notes","id":"Read notes"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/rushed","id":"rushed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sciatica","id":"sciatica"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/spinal%20cord","id":"spinal cord"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attitude","id":"staff attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tumour","id":"Tumour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unheard","id":"unheard"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wait%20times","id":"wait times"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/updates","id":"updates"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/spoken%20over","id":"spoken over"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sad%20angry","id":"sad angry"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/access%20to%20specialist%20services","id":"access to specialist services"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/clarity%20in%20the%20process","id":"clarity in the process"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/864516","id":"864516"}]},{"id":858608,"author":"Marys daughter","authorRoleId":4,"authorRole":"a relative","title":"Active Recovery Team supporting my 83 year old Mum","body":"Active Recovery Team supporting my 83 year old Mum after breaking her arm.  \r\nWhat a fantastic service this is.

The nurse (who I assumed was senior) was very unfriendly and rude, and was annoyed that I had underwear on, which I'd been told by another nurse to keep on because I was on my period. I tried to explain and was cut off and told to \"hurry up\".  \r\nThe actual procedure was excruciating, I was in so much pain. I was never asked if I wanted to stop and wasn't made aware that I could stop the procedure. At no point was I spoken to during the procedure explaining what was happening, in fact I wasn't even told when it was starting - the first I knew was when the Dr inserted a finger inside me and I was in pain (then after someone said, you've just had a rectal exam). I was rushed to sign the paperwork, wasn't allowed to ask questions and nothing was explained.  \r\nI was supposed to be given sedation but I don't even know if I actually got this, and they were annoyed that I asked for it - I was offered no pain relief at all. I've had sedation twice to have wisdom teeth extracted and it was nothing like this. I felt everything, including the biopsies (which I wasn't told would be taken). I was thankful that one nurse was kind enough to let me hold her hand throughout or I think I would have pushed the Dr and other staff off me. I know other people who've had scopes (at other hospitals) under sedation who didn't remember a thing and were not in pain, so I assume mine wasn't administered correctly. After the procedure was over, I was rushed out of the room unable to put underwear back on, again told to hurry up despite how sore I was.  \r\nI felt absolutely humiliated, and like no one (apart from that one nurse) cared about my welfare at all. I was crying going home because I was so sore and even months on I get panic attacks thinking about the experience. My experience at Wishaw hospital has massively contributed to my fear of hospitals and doctors/nurses. I recently had wisdom teeth out at Monklands and every member of staff there was caring, compassionate and I was given lots of options so that I had some control over my care - the opposite to the experience I had at Wishaw. During my sigmoidoscopy, I was treated like a lump of meat, not a person. The Dr didn't care about me at all, I don't think they actually spoke to me throughout. I might have signed consent forms but nothing about it felt consensual - I didn't feel I had any control over what was happening.  \r\nThe whole thing was awful, I would never go back there again - I'd rather wait longer to be seen somewhere else. I can't explain how frightening and dehumanising the experience was. You'd think, with a procedure as intimate as that, the staff would be trying their best to put you at ease and keep you as modest as possible, and try to ensure the patient is as comfortable and pain free as possible.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-06-29T14:29:51.7933333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-07-01T13:26:25.667","readBy":[{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2021)","count":5},{"name":"NHS Lanarkshire","count":5},{"name":"Partnership for Change","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/858610","id":"858610"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/858610/responses","id":"858610"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/858610/healthservices","id":"858610"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/858610/tags","id":"858610"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l308h-endoscopy","id":"L308H-Endoscopy","score":1},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxious","id":"anxious"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fear","id":"fear"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20cared%20for","id":"not cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/answering%20questions","id":"answering questions"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/consent","id":"consent"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dehumanised","id":"dehumanised"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctor","id":"doctor"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/felt%20violated","id":"felt violated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/in%20pain","id":"in pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/panic","id":"panic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/questions","id":"questions"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/rudeness","id":"rudeness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/rushed","id":"rushed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sedation","id":"sedation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/senior%20nurse","id":"senior nurse"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sigmoidoscopy","id":"sigmoidoscopy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vulnerable","id":"vulnerable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/humiliated","id":"humiliated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/explanations","id":"explanations"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/involved%20in%20decisions","id":"involved in decisions"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/spoken%20over","id":"spoken over"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/crying","id":"crying"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain%20relief%20options","id":"pain relief options"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/like%20a%20nuisance","id":"like a nuisance"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/no%20control","id":"no control"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/859334","id":"859334"}]},{"id":858613,"author":"guidewf73","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Podiatry & wound care","body":"My friend suggested I ring up to give my feedback to the lovely podiatry girls I have been under for 1. 5 years, they are always very good and efficient and I just wanted to thank them for helping me with the terrible trouble ive been having with my big toe.

I had to have an assessment from a private psychiatrist last year, after my GP informed me that a referral to Livewell Southwest would go nowhere.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-06-29T15:42:11.63","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2021-07-01T13:48:38.453","readBy":[],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/858627","id":"858627"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/858627/responses","id":"858627"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/858627/healthservices","id":"858627"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/858627/tags","id":"858627"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/nr501","id":"NR501","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ignored","id":"ignored"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/neglected","id":"neglected"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/adhd","id":"adhd"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/assessment","id":"assessment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/follow%20up","id":"follow up"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/time%20wasted","id":"time wasted"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting%20times","id":"waiting times"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/conflicting%20diagnosis","id":"conflicting diagnosis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/access%20to%20specialist%20services","id":"access to specialist services"}]},{"id":858645,"author":"Smackweasel","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Getting my first jab","body":"Absolutely professional from start to finsh.
