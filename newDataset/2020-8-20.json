[{"id":781832,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Fearful","body":"My partner was an inpatient last year on MAU. He was ignored by staff when he said his venflon was blocked and his hand was hurting. He was treated very unkindly by another member of staff and spoken to very rudely. He was in tears when I came to fetch him home. He said he never wanted to go to hospital again. Today he had to go into the Alex for an investigation. He has been worried and not sleeping since knowing. No matter how good most staff are, and some are wonderful,  there are a few that do not care and can make a hospital experience horrific for a patient. He needs surgery now and I am terrified because I will not be allowed to visit and he will be at the mercy of whoever is on duty. Much is said about staff not being prepared to put up with abuse but there are those who seem not to care about the patients and are dismissive, disrespectful and unkind. Staff are there for the patients not the other way round. A bad experience can stay with a patient for years. Please be kind. What if that person was your mother, partner, child. Patients are ill, in pain and frightened.

I am now six weeks post -op. The ergonomics are perfect for ironing with the use of the perching stool.

The actual procedure was carried out by an NHS Doctor and was better/less painful than I had anticipated. \nI am now into my 8th month post treatment and still have visible white and red areas on my skin. I have been told this will eventually go but only time will tell. I really hope so as I am currently having to wear heavy camouflage make up. My overall opinion of the clinic is as follows:-\nIt COULD be so much better! Many staff are untrained (ie not qualified nurses), young, inexperienced and unprofessional. They look the part but lack empathy and “people skills”. This could be improved by spending a little more time and money on training and recruitment. \nThe actual clinic was cramped, uninviting, lacked privacy (especially with the reception area in the middle of the room where everyone can see and hear) and had no refreshment facilities.\nThe paperwork was well out of date, certain things were not explained (despite me asking) and offered things as part of the procedure which were “no longer available/applicable”! \nAnother simple thing to rectify/update.\nThe Doctor lacked any bedside manner, warmth or empathy. I got the impression this was simply a money making exercise (to supplement his NHS salary perhaps)! There was a general lack of interest in me or the work being carried out. In fact, the Doctor almost seemed “world weary”! I thought perhaps it was just an “off day” but this has been the case at every visit! Again, this could be rectified .\nThe treatments are overpriced and there was a definite emphasis on selling products - at further expense!\nI hope this is taken as constructive criticism. This clinic could be SO much better - and hopefully will be one day soon. \nThank you.

Prior to attending the hospital, I received two tests to ensure I was clear for COVID, I was also screened for a high temperature prior to being admitted onto the ward. I am a very nervous person, who has never had surgery before but I do have underlying health conditions. Due to this, I was slightly concerned that they may be exacerbated by the general anesthetic/also the stress of the surgery on my body.  \r\nI can honestly say that it was an amazing experience. From arriving early and being welcomed by a lovely receptionist, who despite wearing a face mask still radiated pure kindness and immediately put me at ease with her lovely sense of humor. The nurses were so kind and caring, paying great attention to detail, and constantly checking how I was. This was pre and post-surgery, constantly making sure I wasn't in pain, and my other conditions were managed. My privacy and dignity were maintained throughout the procedure by the nurses and all members of staff, with heartwarming compassion towards not only me but the other patients on the ward.  \r\nThe two anaesthesiologists that helped choose the right sedation for me. The level to which they catered the drugs to my every need and ensured that anything I was concerned about was addressed, also giving me extra anti-nausea drugs which meant when I woke up I felt amazing and was in disbelief that I had even had surgery. My consultant and the students supporting her were also amazing and really kind, explaining things to me and ensuring I felt ok constantly, despite being extremely busy. Also, the male nurse who was in recovery bay 2 and the male porter who moved me back into the other bay were true gentlemen and the best way to wake up from surgery with their funny jokes and cheerful nature.  \r\nOverall, I am blown away by the kindness of the staff on the ward and want to assure anyone who is going in for day case surgery that you are in the best hands possible, the staff will go the extra mile and help you with anything you required. Some of the sweetest and kindest people I've ever met, true heroes of the NHS and lovely people.

So people ring the bell, no response whatsoever from inside. Ring again, no response. Keep on ringing - someone picks it up, puts the receiver down and doesn't speak at all. Then it goes dead again. We keep on ringing, the receptionist answers, then puts it down halfway through the conversation. Then they don't pick it up again. To say the experience was painful doesn't quite do it justice. Maybe reception thinks they are doing us a disservice by answering at all. You need a new office manager, or an office manager.\nPS The official website states that CQC Rating is Good, but it isn't.

When you have tried to get through on the phone for 30 minutes (without success) and then queued patiently for 20 minutes at the surgery because your call wasn't answered, you do not want to be met with no eye contact when you try to speak or being  stonewalled when you again try to talk. The receptionist I spoke to appeared to be new and actually dealt with things really well and apologised for my wait. She was courteous and personable. The receptionist she called to assist her was surly. My husband had missed a call because he not remove his PPE quickly enough whilst at work. He had tried to call back immediately, with no success. I tried for him and ended up visiting the surgery because my call wasn't answered. Comments like \"I can't ask the Nurse to ring him back because he couldn't get his glove off quick enough\" are really unprofessional and not called for. As a family we are experiencing a difficult time. Every one in our family unit has a disability. We are still trying to work despite countless medical appointments. This is a difficult time for everyone. I'm not complaining about the wait, I appreciate that everyone is busy at this time, but if we need to bear with you, then you need to bear with your patients too. As a Practice you are dealing with people with complex lives and showing a human side helps. Generally your reception staff are personable and it does help, but today I was disappointed. What was done well was that my husband did in fact receive a callback from the nurse which was welcomed because he really wanted to discuss results from tests that were done on 31st July.

I was able to get the help I needed to steady myself and get my medication in track. But as I experience some sevre lows, I was consistently made to feel like what I was feeling wasn't valid and but yet I was still offered medication? How does that work? A traumatic event for me then occurred at the beginning off this year. I came in for help and counselling around this issue not medication which was still offered to me and a prescription was still given to me as a 'just in case'. I feel completely failed bye the system at this point. I appreciate with covid any attempts in counselling would either be on hold or a long waiting list has accumulated. Despite this when I call for an update on my case I would still appreciate being contacted back eventually instead of having to hear it from the out of hours crisis team. I have tried self referrals to other establishments just for the counselling but none of them will even consider me because I am under Bentley house yet I am made to feel pointless and discharged all because I made the better decision for myself not go be on any medication. The receptionists are no better than the doctors, some are good and clearly care about their job and others are down right rude. At this point with how much I've tried to get help for myself which is really hard to do on your own I mainly want things to be looked at and changed for others within that service. During covid phone calls between me and the person I'm assigned two was 'arranged', I use this term loosely, this is because a time and day was set and I had no phone call and I persistently tried too get in contact to see what had gone wrong only to be contacted bye surprise at 7am only to be told she will call back later when no one ever did. I then proceeded to contact the reception and I was made to feel so stupid with the response off \"well next time just take the call there are other patients\". I am fully aware of other patients within the system but when an appointment is made for me, I would like that to be kept or at least just some communication if things have been missed or it needs to be moved. I can't even get help from my gp at this point because they just tell me to call bentley house again.\nIf you have the chance to go to a different mental health service please do ","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-08-20T02:26:20","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-08-20T12:35:14","readBy":[{"name":"Central and North West London Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust","count":1},{"name":"Sheffield University Medical School 2020","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/781893","id":"781893"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/781893/responses","id":"781893"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/781893/healthservices","id":"781893"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/781893/tags","id":"781893"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rv3","id":"RV3","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/crisis","id":"crisis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/traumatic","id":"traumatic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/counselling","id":"counselling"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good","id":"good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/782525","id":"782525"}]},{"id":781894,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Outstanding practice ","body":"This practice is truly outstanding.

The staff are amazing here.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-08-18T22:00:15.2366667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-08-20T12:56:34.883","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Grampian","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/781477","id":"781477"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/781477/responses","id":"781477"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/781477/healthservices","id":"781477"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/781477/tags","id":"781477"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/n411h_420","id":"N411H_420","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/glad","id":"glad"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/location","id":"location"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stomach","id":"stomach"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/access%20to%20support","id":"access to support"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/782160","id":"782160"}]},{"id":781535,"author":"Covid1sttimemum","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Amazing support and care provided","body":"Amazing support and care provided by all staff during the complex and lengthy delivery of my baby boy. &nbsp; Special thanks to staff in Labour ward, Neonatal ICU, and Ashgrove Ward.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-08-19T08:37:08.55","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-08-20T12:59:39.397","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Grampian","count":6},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/781535","id":"781535"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/781535/responses","id":"781535"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/781535/healthservices","id":"781535"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/781535/tags","id":"781535"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/n161h_501","id":"N161H_501","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/delivery","id":"delivery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/labour","id":"labour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/maternity","id":"maternity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/midwives","id":"midwives"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/neonatal","id":"neonatal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20alone","id":"not alone"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/team","id":"team"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20for","id":"cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported","id":"supported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thankful","id":"Thankful"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/783216","id":"783216"}]},{"id":781514,"author":"Paul R","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"My surgery and after care","body":"51 year old man, not exactly fit but not overly unfit either. I was diagnosed with complete heart block 2 years ago and had a pacemaker implant in August 2018.  \r\nSubsequent problems resulted in me having an angiogram which determined I required a triple heart bypass and a mechanical mitrial valve replacement. I can hear it ticking away inside me now. Tick tick tick. It's not unpleasant.  \r\nI received my appointment for surgery fairly quickly especially during these days of Pandemic lockdown. I was admitted to Hospital in August 2020, operated on the following day and was discharged 5 days later. Those figures, on their own, are fairly impressive. But it only serves as a very small piece of the story.  \r\nFrom the surgeon to the catering staff, everyone I encountered was pleasant, engaging and, most importantly, thoroughly professional. Make no mistake, these guys are the BEST. I love them all. They made my stay so much easier to get through. The nursing staff could not do enough. I think they are brilliant. Every one of them.  \r\nI was given virtual meeting appointments with the surgeon and the anaesthetist. Both of whom explained everything that would happen clearly and allowed me to ask any questions I had. And I did have a few. I would say that the one worry I did have about the operation was waking up with a breathing tube in my mouth. That kinda freaked me out. The anaesthetist made it clear to me that it wasn't worth focusing on because a) I probably wouldn't remember it and b) Even if I did I'd be too out my face on drugs to care. She was right, it was b)  \r\nSo from beginning to end I would say I felt thoroughly engaged and treated very well indeed.  \r\nWhen some people see reviews like that, their expectation levels are such that patients at the Golden Jubilee or any NHS hospital are pampered like in a 7* Hotel. This is not the case. The patient must take responsibility for their own health. And that includes wiping their own arse. NHS staff should be treated with the utmost respect as they are trying to fix you, not pamper you.  \r\nMy parting shot is that I did not approve of the sky clapping for the NHS introduced by simpering MPs who put the squeeze on public funding but are quite happy to give themselves a nice 10% payrise when it suits them. The NHS is clearly underfunded and evidently understaffed as a result. Sometimes I did have to wait for something to happen a little longer than I would normally like. Deal with it. These people are running about with very little break time. I would like to say thank you NHS. More importantly however I think I would rather say (to our shambles of a Govt) give these guys the money and resources that they need. They deserve it, I can vouch for that.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-08-19T05:07:15.4","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-08-20T13:00:45.15","readBy":[{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":1},{"name":"Golden Jubilee National Hospital","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/781514","id":"781514"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/781514/responses","id":"781514"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/781514/healthservices","id":"781514"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/781514/tags","id":"781514"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/d102h_172","id":"D102H_172","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/answering%20questions","id":"answering questions"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/brilliant","id":"brilliant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bypass","id":"bypass"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/engaging","id":"engaging"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/funding","id":"funding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/heart","id":"heart"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/heart%20bypass","id":"heart bypass"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pacemaker","id":"pacemaker"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pleasant","id":"pleasant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professional","id":"professional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/quick","id":"quick"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/respect","id":"respect"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staffing","id":"Staffing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/valve","id":"valve"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/valve%20replacement","id":"valve replacement"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happy","id":"happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/impressive","id":"impressive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/well%20treated","id":"well treated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/explanations","id":"explanations"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/782128","id":"782128"}]},{"id":781538,"author":"Nicgm86","authorRoleId":8,"authorRole":"a staff member posting for a patient/service user","title":"Pulmonary Rehab, virtual, Rushcliffe services","body":"Thought the online course was very good, was due to go to classes but due to COVID19 this was stopped.

Throughout that time I have sought help from medical professionals and often felt like my issues were not explored thoroughly enough. It seemed to me that I was being treated like a nuisance for constantly returning with the same issue and was just given a different medication or increased dosage then sent away with no real plan of action to resolve the issue.  \r\nKenny was great at explaining things in a way that was easy for me to understand. It was clear that he really knew what he was talking about and was very knowledgeable. He even went to the effort of printing off a booklet I could take home to further my understanding of my issues. I got a sense that Kenny really did care about the issues I was having and genuinely wanted to help me. Although Kenny’s specialist area of Physiotherapy can’t resolve my issue, Kenny has referred me on to the best person who can help. Even after the appointment he gave me a call just to confirm that he had spoken to the specialist I have been referred to. I was really touched by how much he cared and this gave me real confidence I am on the right track to better health.  \r\nI can’t thank Kenny enough for this invaluable advice and how this has helped me to move forward with getting better.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-08-19T16:10:21.7566667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-08-20T14:39:43.653","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lanarkshire","count":7},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":1},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2020)","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/781597","id":"781597"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/781597/responses","id":"781597"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/781597/healthservices","id":"781597"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/781597/tags","id":"781597"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sl9-physiotherapy","id":"SL9-physiotherapy","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/advice","id":"advice"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20about","id":"Cared about"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/chronic%20pain","id":"chronic pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/easy%20to%20talk%20to","id":"easy to talk to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helped","id":"helped"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/knowledgeable","id":"knowledgeable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/physiotherapy","id":"physiotherapy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing","id":"amazing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confidence","id":"confidence"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/trust","id":"Trust"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20at%20ease","id":"put at ease"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/clear%20explanations","id":"clear explanations"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/more%20understanding","id":"more understanding"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/782140","id":"782140"}]},{"id":781631,"author":"Rms1","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"My experience","body":"I had cut my leg accidentally on a broken plate, the moment I arrived my family weren’t allowed in with me, I suffer from major depression and high anxiety and to top it off wearing a mask really heightens my nervousness.

I've had friends and family members leave the practice and move elsewhere within the last 2 years due to their own experiences. I now live abroad and have been asked to provide part of my medical history to my GP in Australia and to try and get an email or contact for this practice was like trying to crack the DaVinci Code. 99% of practices have their email accessible, not here though. At first trying to get an contactable email address was like pulling teeth, they didn't want to give one. Then when told about the seriousness got one, gave the WRONG email out. Then when called again was spoken to on the phone as if it was an awful thing to ask for an email and that \"We're not allowed to give it out\". I'm glad I don't have to deal with Middleton Lodge anymore and I would recommend to anyone to sign up to another local GP.

The pain relief I was on was causing other serious side effects, side effects they wer enot aware were possible. There solution to this is to immediately stop this pain med and offer up absolulty no suitable alternative. So effectively I have gone from opiods to paracetamol. Paracetamol does nothing, nothing. My pain needs treatment, this place seemingly are unable to offer an appointment for injections, they can't even offer an idea of when an appointment might be. A month, 2months, 3 months? They don't know and frankly don't care. Instead, they want to have monthly phone conversations to deliver \"care\". Right. My condition is a phycial thing, do you get that? Physcial. On what planet does having a chat on the phone make any difference the pain I'm experiencing? The only difference is they obviously get paid to have completely useless phone conversations, so for the them the more the better, the fact they are a complete waste of time and provide no tangible outcome is totally irrelevant. And further to this, they try to encourage you to a group discussion setting, which they profit from again, another waste of time where you can all talk about your pain with other people in pain and solve absolulty nothing. Clearly the insinuation is that patients are lieing about their pain, and they think by talking about it all these liers will come to realise that all that pain which has destroyed their life, career and means you can't get out of bed was in fact all in your head. Condescending, patronising and frankly a completely useless service set up solely for this private company to make a buck without actually doing anything constrictive to reduce suffering in patients.

The fantastic ladies on reception have never failed to smile, show empathy and will go out of their way to help where they can; never once have I felt their questions to be intrusive and they are happy to explain the process from start to finish. The nurses and ANP have a huge skill set and played a crucial role in obtaining a diagnosis for my mother to enable the unique kind of care she needed to ensure her last months were ones of dignity and love. I have the greatest admiration for the nurse who takes my blood every month as I’m not the easiest person when I comes to needles, but she remembers this and goes a long way to relax me if I’m particularly bad. So, finally the doctors, and I’ve seen a few at this surgery but without their knowledge, input, guidance and advice they have given me over the last few months, I can say with some confidence that my outcomes would be considerably less positive than they currently are., and for that I give my gratitude to the whole surgery.
