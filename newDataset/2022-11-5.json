It wasn’t a straightforward birth  and I wanted to say how brilliant all of the staff were throughout, and thank them for making what could have been a traumatic experience into something I will look back on with nothing but positives to say about the care and treatment I received. \n\nEveryone was kind, professional and caring, and incredibly hard-working. All of the midwives and doctors I saw took the time to explain carefully what was happening at each point of my labour, as well as listening to my preferences and discussing potential outcomes, which was so appreciated. I was left completely in awe of the staff and grateful for the services we are so privileged to receive on the NHS. \n\nIt is obvious how hard the staff work. One of the student midwives assisting even stayed long past the end of her shift, and staff who were present at the birth came to speak to me and my husband afterwards to give us opportunity to ask any questions about the process, which was really appreciated.\nI really want to say the biggest thank you to everyone in the Delivery Unit for the support I received during a scary time for the incredible care they showed. I really couldn’t thank them enough and will always be so grateful to them for their exemplary work.

You are then told you should have called earlier (despite there being no chance of getting through on the phone) or booking through the app. The app doesn't let you book phone consultations for most issues other than prescriptions so its very useless advice.

Unfortunately I have to use their services more than I would like and this frustrates me as I often feel like I will never get better well maybe improve not better and this really stresses me out. The doctor I currently see and have done for the last few years I can not thank enough. She always recommends medication that will help and she checks I am okay. I am not the best at explain things so don't make it easy but most of the time she understands me, she makes feel really comfortable so don't get too nervous. I believe that she would go out of her way to help anybody and genuinely cares. God knows where I would be without her.\n\nI struggle with communication sometimes miss understand things on a daily basis but the practice manger is amazing at explaining things. She clearly wants to make this doctors the best it can be and wants to help all patients. A few years ago I had an infection and ignored it until it got worse. The surgery was closed as it was the weekend so I sent an email I didnt expect anything until the following week but I got an email Sunday afternoon and by Monday I had some antibiotics. Doubt I would get that anywhere else.\n\nYou can't please everybody but I know the manager really wants to\n\n\nThere is also a nurse there who is lovely, she has patched me up many times. She is really kind, I always ask for her.She did pull me up on something last visit which I stewed on for a bit but she was right\n\nI had help from a social prescriber and I really warmed to her, she helped me with a phone call and spoke for me when got stuck.\n\nThere is many other staff there who I am sure they are just as good. One GP who I didnt really take to and knows this had to see me for a while and even though he knew I was not too keen he looked after me. One instance that sticks with me was when he agreed to contact somebody for me, I hadn’t even got home before he called me to say he had tried they were not available but would keep me updated. I was very grateful and was really impressed with that\n\nThank you Armley for looking after me and doing what you can to make sure I have the pain relief I need ","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-11-04T21:02:55","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-11-05T12:11:23","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Leeds ICB","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/994004","id":"994004"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/994004/responses","id":"994004"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/994004/healthservices","id":"994004"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/994004/tags","id":"994004"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/b86003","id":"B86003","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ignored","id":"ignored"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nervous","id":"nervous"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/antibiotics","id":"antibiotics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/better","id":"better"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helped","id":"helped"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/in%20pain","id":"in pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/infection","id":"infection"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/looked%20after","id":"looked after"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20good","id":"not good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20impressed","id":"not impressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/okay","id":"okay"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain%20relief","id":"pain relief"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/relief","id":"relief"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing","id":"amazing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/impressed","id":"impressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20grateful","id":"very grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doing%20well","id":"doing well"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/worse%20than%20before","id":"worse than before"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/in%20the%20way","id":"in the way"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/comfortable","id":"comfortable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20looked%20after","id":"not looked after"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20nervous","id":"very nervous"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/like%20myself","id":"like myself"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/995088","id":"995088"}]},{"id":994003,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"We have again cancelled your appointment","body":"I just want to 'thank you from the bottom of my heart' for your letter informing me that you have cancelled my appointment to which I have been waited a six months.

I work and full time care for my Mum and have limited access to internet.  My 79 year old mother cannot even turn a computer on so constantly pushing people down an e-consult route is entirely inappropriate for much of the population - ironically the ones who likely will need the service most.  Earlier this week I rang and was told I was no 1 in the queue.  I got through to a receptionist and asked for a doctors call back having to again explain I have no or limited internet access (why can this not just be logged on a patient's record so they do not have to feel inadequate or embarrassed each time they call?)  My request was logged.  I was told I may not be called that day but the likelihood was that I would as I had called at 8.30am.  Given as a carer it is really hard to get any me time at all to take care of my own issues I initially felt assured by this.  However by midday the next day still no call at all.  I called the surgery again.  The receptionist apologised for the misleading impression I had been given and said I was scheduled to be called on Friday - 4 whole days after my phone call first thing in the morning when I clearly explained I had been in significant pain for months.  She offered to update the request to reflect when the call might be best for me, since I'd explained I was also due to take my Mum for an appointment on the Friday so having no clue as a carer when I'd be called was unhelpful.  When I stated when it would be good to call she then said she could not put a request for a time on the record.  So why on earth offer to if you cannot?  By now I just felt totally exasperated and was trying hard to explain I am a carer and I start a new job on Monday therefore if the doctor wants to see me (and I would really appreciate that) then I would need to be called early.  She said she would update the request.  She also said I should have been called back on the day I rang to be informed when I would be called.  (So now we are in the realms of calling people to tell them when you will call them...).  Needless to say it is now almost 2pm on the Friday and the doctor has still not called so any chance or hope I have of being seen this week when I know I will struggle massively next week due to a new job and caring commitments is virtually zero.  Surely vulnerable people are worth more than this and surely a record can reflect someone's ease of access to the internet and/or vulnerability so a doctor can better triage and prioritise?  I've had to use a neighbour's computer to even do this review.  I don't want to be unkind - many times the receptionists there have been patient and kind but the system simply does not work for patients who need it most.  And consultation feedback is only sought from people who are you, not too unhealthy and have internet access.  So you have redesigned a system to suit the people who need it least.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-11-04T13:54:23","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-11-05T15:47:08","readBy":[{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2022)","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/994073","id":"994073"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/994073/responses","id":"994073"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/994073/healthservices","id":"994073"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/994073/tags","id":"994073"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/j82144","id":"J82144","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/embarrassed","id":"embarrassed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/better","id":"better"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/exasperated","id":"exasperated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/in%20pain","id":"in pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/informed","id":"informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20good","id":"not good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/triage","id":"triage"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vulnerable","id":"vulnerable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hope","id":"Hope"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20ease","id":"at ease"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/assured","id":"assured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/no%20hope","id":"no hope"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20at%20ease","id":"not at ease"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/995471","id":"995471"}]},{"id":994075,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Physiotherapy","body":"I started physio earlier this year and was in much pain with arthritis in my lower back and both hips.

My mother has paid into the NHS all her life. To be told in an urgent case, her needs are less of a priority was in my opinion unsatisfactory. Surgery isn't open anymore on a Saturday morning so she has to wait until Monday! I have noticed (and it isn't just this practice) them regularly stating they are fully booked up and yet the surgery is empty apart from one or two people, certainly not packed out like they used to be. Doctors are continuously proclaiming to be overstretched in terms of not enough hours in the day and yet there is definitely no evidence of this! Trying to get a Drs appointment these days is very frustrating. All walk-in centres nearby no longer exist and A&E is always full with a wait of between three and four hours.
