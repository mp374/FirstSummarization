Unfortunately he had Strep B when he was born which I understand is no one’s fault. However, it could have been picked up on early in my pregnancy by a simple swab. It was very upsetting to find out the NHS no longer offers these swabs in pregnancy. I felt let down that my son was ill with something potentially so serious when it was completely avoidable.  \r\nDuring my labour my temperature spiked extremely high and both myself and my son had to be given antibiotics. Bloods were also taken from my son which was when the Strep B was found. Bloods were taken regularly from my son for the remainder of our time in the hospital and my son was frequently returned to me with blood on his clothes and not dressed properly. Having my son constantly taken away was very difficult for me and it was made worse by the lack of care shown to him when he was away from me.  \r\nWhen I gave birth (Nov 2021), the hospital was still operating Covid visiting. While I understand the desire to limit infection I don’t think my needs as a new mother were considered. All new mothers need support after giving birth and I particularly needed it as I was so unwell myself. I now know that I had sepsis but this was not communicated to me at any stage of my stay in hospital and I only found out 18 months later when another doctor saw it in my notes. Only two 2 hour visits were permitted each day which left me completely alone with my new baby 20 hours a day. This made it very difficult for me and my partner to bond with our son as he has such limited time with us and I was trying to recover myself.  \r\nI was understandly upset by the lack of support I had and my son being ill, however, when I tried to express this to midwives I was told to get a grip as other people had it worse. At the time I was too unwell to really take it in, but looking back this is appalling from the staff who are meant to be supporting new mothers. Unfortunately, this behaviour wasn’t a one off, I was made to feel embarrassed and weak by staff for wanting support either from them or my partner. Staff also made me feel like I was a bad mum when I asked about when my son and I would be able to go home. I was told I need to take Strep B seriously as a baby downstairs had just died from it. This was extremely upsetting as I didn’t even want to consider the possibility that my baby would die and the only reason I had asked about going home was because I was struggling so badly with the isolation of being in hospital, not because I believe Strep B to be a minor illness.  \r\nI found most midwives to be very unhelpful and would take hours to bring basic things like milk. While I absolutely understand how busy a maternity ward is, I don't feel it's acceptable to be without such basic essentials for so long. After a few days my partner started to buy ready made milk and bring it to the hospital as it was clear we couldn’t rely on the midwives in the ward.  \r\nThe situation became so bad that my family contacted the ward during my stay because they were so concerned for my mental health. Following this, staff did allow my partner to stay but it was made very clear to us that this was an inconvenience despite me having being in a single room for my whole stay.  \r\nCommunication between staff on the ward was also terrible. With every shift change I would have to explain my situation over again, this was very frustrating as it felt like the staff were unprepared and relying on patients to provide information.  \r\nThis experience has left me with extreme anxiety surrounding hospitals and I now cannot enter a hospital on my own without experiencing panic attacks. This has meant that when I had my second child recently I did everything possible to try to ensure we wouldn’t be kept in hospital as I was terrified of experiencing the same situation again.  \r\nOn top of the other issues, the food was very poor. I am vegetarian and have an allergy to beans and chickpeas and at one point the only meal offered to me was a cold salad consisting of iceberg lettuce and chopped boiled egg. This doesn’t really constitute a full meal under the best of circumstances and certainly not in winter for someone who has just given birth and was unwell. My family had to bring us meals every day, often a takeaway, which was expensive and not very healthy but was at least warm and filling.  \r\nOverall, I have been left with no faith in the maternity unit at QEUH and a poor impression of NHS maternity care overall.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-05-24T15:31:16.35","progress":"Made change","dateOfPublication":"2023-05-25T07:34:57.033","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":11}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1070549","id":"1070549"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1070549/responses","id":"1070549"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1070549/healthservices","id":"1070549"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1070549/tags","id":"1070549"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sj9qe-matcare1","id":"sj9qe-matcare1","score":1},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxious","id":"anxious"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/embarrassed","id":"embarrassed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frustrated","id":"frustrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/inconvenience","id":"inconvenience"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/isolated","id":"isolated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lack%20of%20care","id":"Lack of care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stressed","id":"stressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/alone","id":"alone"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bedside%20manner","id":"bedside manner"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/birth","id":"birth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/early%20pregnancy","id":"early pregnancy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/food","id":"food"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/giving%20birth","id":"giving birth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/group%20b%20strep","id":"Group B Strep"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/infection","id":"infection"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/labour","id":"labour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lonely","id":"lonely"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/maternity","id":"maternity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health%20awareness","id":"Mental health Awareness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/midwives","id":"midwives"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/panic%20attack","id":"panic attack"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pregnancy","id":"pregnancy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sepsis","id":"sepsis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attitude","id":"staff attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/uncomfortable","id":"uncomfortable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/understanding","id":"understanding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unhelpful","id":"unhelpful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/weak","id":"weak"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1071156","id":"1071156"}]},{"id":1070688,"author":"Yorks","authorRoleId":4,"authorRole":"a relative","title":"Poor communication and staff behavior","body":"My dad was taken in to A&E by ambulance from a community hospital. He has been completely fine and prob the best he has been in a long time.  \r\nWe were extremely worried. When I got to A&E and spoke to my dad he was in the ambulance assessment part. My dad wanted some water as he was running a fever. I went to ask one of the nurses who was polite and said to wait until they had had his blood drawn. I asked the nurse if I needed to be worried. They said they didn’t know and asked the nurse in charge next to them. This nurse turned around and said - he’s only been in the department for 17 mins. Said in a tone that was like how stupid are you, I told them I didn’t appreciate being spoken to like that and walked away because I was so angry at being spoken to like that. I had no info about why he was there really apart from a fever. I was very worried for my dad and if he had been in the department for that length of time I would hope that they would have known if he was dangerously ill.  \r\nI returned to my dad's cubicle and said what had happened. The nurse in charge came over and basically told me I was being confrontational and I should leave the department. I said I walked away from the situation - that’s not confrontational. The nurse said I have witnesses and cameras. I was so angry at them and in total disbelief at their behaviour. I said I didn’t like the way they spoke to me and said I am worried. I use my hands to talk to explain etc, and their response was - don’t point your fingers at me. The nurse tried to make me leave and made my father distressed. I feel they were totally inappropriate and bullied me. I was remarkably calm because if I hadn’t of been focused on my dad I would have said more to them.  \r\nI understand the pressures, I understand they get abused by people. I think this nurse had decided I was going to do that and treated me like an aggressive person. I am far from that. I have no doubt they judged me but also they were totally inappropriate to speak to me how they did - I feel they then were out of control and on a power trip trying to make me leave when I had walked away from the situation. This distressed us as a family. A friend of mine walked in and saw me crying and heard what was going on and gave me a hug. The nurse flipped to being sympathetic and getting me a tissue. Like seriously. I am so upset and angry now by their behaviour.  \r\nFast forward to my dad being in a cubicle and had his blood pressure taken which we could see was very low. A nurse walked in and was like - we are just going to move him to resus because of his blood pressure. We were shown to a relatives room and said someone would come and to give them 5 mins. 45 agonising mins later my brother went to look for someone. He came back and said the nurse meant to tell us he had been moved to HDU where my dad was sat up and talking away. We had been fearing the worst for all that time and not one word of communication.  \r\nWe asked about his condition numerous times and were told someone would come and they never did. I don’t fault their clinical care but their treatment of us was not good at all. Caused us far more worry and stress. We finally found out after about 5 hours or more that he had sepsis. They seemed matter of fact that he would have IV antibiotics and fluids for 48 hours and return to the community rehab hospital. My father has many complex medical problems and has been in hospital for 6 months. He has been given CPE and VRE by BRI and ended up with sepsis.  \r\nHaving been around a hospital for 6 months, the one thing I would never do is be confrontational to staff. I believe the NHS is broken and the care patients get sometimes is totally below basic human need. I have seen the stress and upset this causes nurses and how hard they work. I have been encouraging, grateful and have always tried to build the nurses up with my words. For that nurse in charge to speak to me and behave how they did was disgusting and threatening, in my view. I feel that to leave us in a relatives room with no communication is disgusting.  \r\nYou looked after my dad and got him sorted - was there more that could have been done - yes, we had to keep asking for him to get assistance. It seems to me that the staff are quite clearly burned out, and I get that, but that day was a dark day in our family and the staff seemed completely devoid of any understanding or empathy for that. I felt like we were just a case, a job, a number - we were not a family worried about their dad and my dad was not a person, just a case, a condition to be managed.  \r\nI am thankful for the clinical care and for giving him the treatment quickly, but they caused us and my dad distress with their lack of communication and behaviour.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-05-25T02:12:34.5633333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-05-25T07:51:03.24","readBy":[{"name":"Bradford Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1070688","id":"1070688"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1070688/responses","id":"1070688"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1070688/healthservices","id":"1070688"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1070688/tags","id":"1070688"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rae01_180","id":"RAE01_180","score":3},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/angry","id":"angry"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frightened","id":"frightened"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/worried","id":"worried"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/assistance","id":"assistance"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20pressure","id":"blood pressure"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bullied","id":"bullied"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/clinical%20care","id":"Clinical Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/distressed","id":"distressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/empathy","id":"empathy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fever","id":"fever"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fluids","id":"fluids"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/iv%20antibiotics","id":"iv antibiotics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sepsis","id":"sepsis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attitude","id":"staff attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20behaviour","id":"staff behaviour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/understanding","id":"understanding"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1071045","id":"1071045"}]},{"id":1070311,"author":"zuluxr64","authorRoleId":4,"authorRole":"a relative","title":"The service was excellent","body":"I attended the New Victoria Hospital for a bronchoscopy yesterday, the service was excellent.

I have recently been involved in medical tests following a slightly elevated PSA level. Following a recent MRI, during which I was also looked after very well I was contacted by the appointments secretary of the Urology clinic, who offered me a TRUS biopsy appointment that afternoon. I was looked after by five staff, including the person at Urology reception, two of whom, whose names have slipped my mind.  \r\nConsultant Joby, Student Nurse Alison and Nurse Ruth.  \r\nMr?/Dr? Taylor explained the procedure, and although was very swift and softly spoken in his delivery, I could pick out the salient points and give my permission for the procedure to go ahead. He informed me prior to any actions taking place throughout and any sensations I might be aware of, although I was trying to distract myself by chatting away to Alison.  \r\nAlison looked after me wonderfully, and chatted away with me through out the whole procedure, although I doubt she got much of a chance to speak as I tend to talk too much or not at all in a stressful situation. On this occasion it was the former. The procedure was completed and Ruth came into the room and I chatted with both her and Alison, probably sharing too much, and I was given instructions as to what was required of me, regarding booking a results appointment and and what to expect from my body following the biopsy with regard to bleeding etc.  \r\nI was also given an information sheet to take away with me Re: signs and symptoms to look out for should there be any side effects.  \r\nThe whole team were fabulous and I felt informed and put at ease regarding the whole procedure. Having formerly worked in the NHS myself some years ago, I felt that Alison's patient care skills, went above and beyond, the others performed professionally and with respect, making me feel safe and

I'm sorry to have come to the end of my sessions.  \r\nThanks to all of the staff who helped me through this - just wish more people could have access to this service, which has faced reductions in recent times.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-05-24T11:32:29.68","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-05-25T09:44:42.793","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":5}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1070407","id":"1070407"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1070407/responses","id":"1070407"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1070407/healthservices","id":"1070407"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1070407/tags","id":"1070407"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/c418h-hydro","id":"C418H-hydro","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/assessment","id":"assessment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back%20pain","id":"back pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/encouraged","id":"encouraged"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/heard","id":"heard"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hip","id":"hip"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/in%20safe%20hands","id":"in safe hands"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mobility","id":"mobility"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/more%20confident","id":"more confident"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain%20relief","id":"pain relief"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/parking","id":"parking"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/physio","id":"physio"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting%20list","id":"waiting list"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wonderful%20staff","id":"wonderful staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20at%20ease","id":"put at ease"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/access%20to%20service","id":"access to service"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1074029","id":"1074029"}]},{"id":1070906,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Amazing practice","body":"This is the first time a GP practice has proactively addressed my needs and the needs of my family.

The service seems to be run by trainees, no breakfast implemented, they are not given choices of what they’d like to cook it’s always the OT wanting the food and snacks, patients opinions are disregarded and if they speak up they are shot down by the OT and shouted at, cupboard doors slammed, huffing and puffing.  \r\nI’ve never liked this service it was a farce first time round 4 years ago it’s even worse now.

Complete puts you off even trying again as its hard enough ringing and tell the receptionist why you want the appointment to start with.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2023-05-24T11:08:52","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2023-05-25T10:47:17","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1070948","id":"1070948"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1070948/responses","id":"1070948"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1070948/healthservices","id":"1070948"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1070948/tags","id":"1070948"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/b85614001","id":"B85614001","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20illness","id":"mental illness"}]},{"id":1070947,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Poor patient care","body":"My daughter has been waiting for a referral to gynaecology for 3 months.

Nobody called me until 12:15, I missed the call as it was too late for me to receive the call as I was back at work at that time.  \r\nI really don't know how to get hold of this department while I am suffering.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-05-24T14:05:45.8733333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-05-25T11:02:03.903","readBy":[{"name":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1070509","id":"1070509"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1070509/responses","id":"1070509"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1070509/healthservices","id":"1070509"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1070509/tags","id":"1070509"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/ryj02","id":"RYJ02","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frustrated","id":"frustrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appointments","id":"appointments"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/musculoskeletal","id":"musculoskeletal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/telephone%20appointment","id":"telephone appointment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting%20time","id":"waiting time"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1075375","id":"1075375"}]},{"id":1070959,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Not impressed ","body":"Very disappointed not to have been able to see a GP for face to face appoint since joining practice last october , I have high blood pressure & recently diagnosed type 2 diabetic \nI have already changed to new surgery & would not recommend the Alney practice , chelt Rd surgery needs a drastic refurb , it’s like stepping back to the 60,s.& has no parking .\nTakes on average 45 mins  to have your call answered ","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2023-05-24T12:29:02","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-05-25T11:03:09","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1070959","id":"1070959"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1070959/responses","id":"1070959"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1070959/healthservices","id":"1070959"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1070959/tags","id":"1070959"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l84606","id":"L84606","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disappointed","id":"disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood","id":"blood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20pressure","id":"blood pressure"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diabetic","id":"diabetic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/face","id":"face"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/high%20blood%20pressure","id":"high blood pressure"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/parking","id":"parking"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20disappointed","id":"very disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/under%20pressure","id":"under pressure"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/like%20myself","id":"like myself"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1094043","id":"1094043"}]},{"id":1070957,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Very suppirtive","body":"Phoned up with sensitive issues.

If you have a spare 20 minutes then give them a call to be greeted with an insanely long voicemail which does everything it can to stop people trying to book an appointment.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2023-05-24T14:26:36","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2023-05-25T11:45:14","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1070991","id":"1070991"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1070991/responses","id":"1070991"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1070991/healthservices","id":"1070991"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1070991/tags","id":"1070991"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/m84036","id":"M84036","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/chest","id":"chest"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency","id":"emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tiredness","id":"tiredness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hope","id":"Hope"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/no%20hope","id":"no hope"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/like%20myself","id":"like myself"}]},{"id":1070990,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Helpful","body":"I have only been with this Practice since July last year (2022) but have always found the receptionists very friendly and helpful.

To begin with, one of the doctors accompanied me to the operating theatre. During our short walk, he took the initiative to inquire about my hobbies which took my mind off things.  \r\nThe nurses were incredibly attentive, constantly checking in on me and inquiring about my well-being.  \r\nI can confidently say that this hospital and its exceptional team deserve a perfect score of 10/10.
