[{"id":935737,"author":"Handyman","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"A fantastic innovation","body":"Previous lengthy waits and male pride fueled a reluctance to attend the A&E department for a small but deep cut on my arm.  \r\nHowever, as there was a high risk of infection. A first aider friend advised me to present myself at the Minor Injuries Unit, QEUH, Glasgow, a medical department I had never heard of before.  \r\nA&E was as busy as I expected it to be, and I felt that I had been awarded special VIP status in bypassing the numerous patients awaiting triage by heading to straight to the MIU.  \r\nWithin minutes of arrival I was welcomed and registered by Karen, a physiotherapist enthusiastically expanding her expertise to include the treatment of minor injuries under the relaxed and confident tutelage of Elaine.  \r\nWithin an hour I was bandaged and heading home, my wound having been x-rayed, cleaned and treated efficiently, painlessly and without further trauma.  \r\nAdd a tetanus booster to the visit and the entire process was streamlined to the point of perfection.  \r\nWhile each and every staff member I met was caring and helpful it was clear that Karen and Elaine share a passion for their vocation and they obviously love helping and healing people.  \r\nTheir devotion to delivering proficient healthcare and the successful and smooth operation of their unit was evident in their considerate approach and conduct throughout my treatment.  \r\nThey explained their procedures to me in clear and concise terms, ensuring that I left with full knowledge of what to expect as my injury healed, detailing my responsibilities towards re-dressing and protecting the wound, reassuringly including the option to return without hesitation should any difficulties arise.  \r\nThey were polite, courteous and friendly; treating me with unbiased compassion and sympathy, undeserved given the stupidity I'd demonstrated in sustaining my injury. They are an absolute credit to the NHS, the Hospital and the MIU to which they clearly enjoy feeling an integral part.  \r\nThe unit is undoubtedly a place where they feel totally comfortable and proud to work, operating at the top of their game in offering the best treatment and care for their patients, whom they regard more as guests. I'm privileged to have benefitted from their skills and I hope they feel personally rewarded every day, knowing how invaluable their commitment is.  \r\nI thank them for choosing medicine as their profession.  \r\nThe existence of the Minor Injuries Unit is a God-send, and I saw for myself in real time its provision of tangible relief to the pressure on the main A&E department.  \r\nIf I hadn't been convinced to go to the MIU, I would almost certainly have avoided hospital and insisted upon treating the wound myself, which could have led to serious complications, ultimately costing the Health Service more time and money.  \r\nI liken the MIU to the medical version of a drive-thru, it's a fantastic innovation.  \r\nGenius status applies to those who devised its inception, and countless blessings are owed to those making it work.  \r\nHaving eliminated the requirement for triage, it's the perfect solution for the timeous assessment and treatment of minor cases.  \r\nGiven the regular press reports illustrating the stress that A&E departments countrywide are under, surely the MUI initiative has to be included as a strategy in easing the strain on every buckling casualty dept, getting eejits like me in and out the door asap?  \r\nGiven the high quality of care and benefit to patients and the NHS I might have expected the MIU to be situated within a purpose built, state of the art facility, well signposted and easily locatable beside the main A&E Department, instead of a makeshift portacabin hidden within hospital grounds.  \r\nThere is currently little or no visual directional guidance, which is surprising considering that it a part of Scotland's flagship hospital.  \r\nThat aside, the temporary building was impeccably clean and I had no doubt that I was in a safe and sterile environment, operating in full compliance with guidelines to mitigate Covid 19 risks.  \r\nI concluded that the unit must be relatively new and ready for growth and development. With medical personnel such as my own carers at the point of patient contact, the QEUH MIU can only flourish as it is upgraded.  \r\nI don't plan to injure myself again anytime soon, but if I do I know that because there are people like Elaine and Karen ready to assist at a moments notice,  \r\nI won't have any hesitation in seeking professional medical treatment from the onset, rather than procrastinating.  \r\nThank You QEUH MIU, I hope to see you expand and enhance in the future, you truly are the crutch that your A&E department so desperately needs.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-05-02T17:01:57.44","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-05-05T07:54:43.063","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":7},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2022)","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/935737","id":"935737"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/935737/responses","id":"935737"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/935737/healthservices","id":"935737"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/935737/tags","id":"935737"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sj9-south-glasgow-hospital-minor-injury","id":"SJ9-south-glasgow-hospital-minor-injury","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/accident%20&%20emergency","id":"accident & emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/arm","id":"arm"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/caring","id":"caring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cleanliness","id":"cleanliness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/considerate","id":"considerate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/courteous","id":"courteous"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/directions","id":"Directions"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dressing","id":"dressing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/efficient","id":"efficient"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helpful","id":"helpful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/injury","id":"injury"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/minor%20injuries","id":"minor injuries"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/physio","id":"physio"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/polite","id":"polite"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/privileged","id":"privileged"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sympathy","id":"sympathy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tetanus","id":"tetanus"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/welcomed","id":"welcomed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wound","id":"wound"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/x%20ray","id":"x ray"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassion","id":"compassion"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fantastic","id":"fantastic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/innovative","id":"innovative"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/skilled","id":"skilled"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20safe","id":"very safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/well%20explained","id":"well explained"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/a%20credit","id":"a credit"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/936582","id":"936582"}]},{"id":935738,"author":"Gurveen","authorRoleId":4,"authorRole":"a relative","title":"Inconsistent and unhelpful support from the Home Treatment Team","body":"I took my father to A&E due to his presentation of low mood, anxiety and suicidal ideation. It was difficult to get my father to go to A&E to access the support he required and took great encouragement due to his anxiety despite him desperately wanting the support. At A&E, my father was referred to the Crisis Team for a medication review. Following this review, we began to receive intervention from the Hounslow Home Treatment Team who provided almost daily home visits.  \r\nOur initial home visit was with a Mental Health Nurse. Their attitude towards my father we found to be completely inappropriate, unprofessional and inexcusable. They made extremely unhelpful and inappropriate comments about my father’s situation and said that they felt sorry for his daughters for having to deal with my father. My father is already struggling with thoughts of guilt of being a burden to others around him, and this comment alongside the general behaviour and attitude towards my father only further contributed to my father’s anxiety. My father was shaking after this interaction. When I and my father mentioned that the behaviour and comments were unhelpful they responded by saying they knew they were direct and they had gotten this feedback from other people before, but that’s the way they work. I am extremely concerned about his behaviour and these comments, as these are potentially triggering for individuals who are already experiencing a mental health crisis.  \r\nIn the following visits, my father shared how despite trying the new medication suggested by the doctor, his anxiety is not improving and that he is struggling everyday, especially in the mornings, with chest pain, shaking hands, headaches, and pains elsewhere in the body. Several of the nurses who attended home visits suggested that my father should be prescribed medication due to the severity of his anxiety. He was continuously told that his concerns and opinions would be passed on to the doctor in time for his next medication review. However, on the day of his next medication review, he was not prescribed any change in medication and the nurse who came to visit him on the evening after his medication review cited reasons of some medications being addictive.  \r\nWe explained to the nurse that my father has previously taken similar medication in the past on a PRN basis. I showed the nurse a box of the medication issued from 2021 and my father still had 1 tablet remaining. Once the nurse had left, my father presented as severely anxious. He presented with laboured breathing, shaking and shared concerns of increased heart rate, headache - like my head is in a vice - and severe chest pains, due to the contradicting information regarding medication. It is as if he is given false hope during these visits, only for these moments of hope that he is clinging onto to be taken away.  \r\nWe told the nurse that we would be making a complaint and that I would be speaking to the doctor the next morning. The doctor then arranged for my father to be prescribed the medication twice a day. They shared that my father should be on this medication due to the severity of his anxiety and that if this medication does not help, they will put my father back on an alternative as this helped my father previously but was stopped by his GP.  \r\nMy father was feeling more optimistic as he was now being heard and being involved in his care. The medication was helpful in managing his anxiety. We asked for no home visits over the weekend as we had a guest staying over and my father did not want the guest to be aware of his anxiety. Without the visits and my father taking his medication, he was able to manage his anxiety well and he was starting to feel better.  \r\n[Very unhappy with 'Seeing the whole me']  \r\n  \r\nHowever, following this period, when the team returned for a home visit, the nurse once again said that my father should no longer be on the medication despite only taking it for a week, as it is addictive. My father shared that the doctor had specifically said that he should be on a specific dose each day, but he was only given a lower dose by the nurse who visited. They said that the team would bring more the next day but they only brought him 7 tablets. I then had to call the doctor the day after to ascertain whether my father was still prescribed the medication and the dosage he should be on. They shared that my father should still be on the higher dose. I shared my frustrations with the doctor on the call. They were apologetic and agreed to stopping home visits for a while due to the toll it was having on my father.  \r\n[Very unhappy with 'Being listened to']  \r\n[Very unhappy with 'Involved in decisions']  \r\n  \r\nWe felt frustrated that our concerns were not being heard. My father having to open up and share his mental health difficulties every day is a difficult process and leaves him feeling heavy. This exhausting process of reliving and recalling his difficulties everyday is made worse when following this, he is not provided the support discussed during these visits. There have been numerous occasions when I have been called by my father when I am at work, and when I have returned from work and he is in extreme distress due to his interactions with the crisis team. This is a service which is aimed at providing support to individuals experiencing a mental health crisis. Instead of providing supportive and empathetic care, they are making my father’s condition worse. A crisis team should be offering a more empathetic and supportive approach due to the level of risk presented by their patients.The team must be consistent with their guidance on what they tell their patients as this confusion can be triggering and distressing and further add to their difficulties in their moments of crisis.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-05-02T17:22:25.14","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-05-05T08:20:35.92","readBy":[{"name":"West London NHS Trust","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/935738","id":"935738"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/935738/responses","id":"935738"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/935738/healthservices","id":"935738"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/935738/tags","id":"935738"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rkl-primary-care-plus-hounslow","id":"RKL-Primary-care-plus-hounslow","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxious","id":"anxious"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frustrated","id":"frustrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20being%20listened%20to","id":"not being listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scared","id":"scared"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20frustrated","id":"very frustrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/accident%20&%20emergency","id":"accident & emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/behaviour","id":"behaviour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/chest%20pain","id":"chest pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/depressed","id":"depressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/depression","id":"depression"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/empathy","id":"empathy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/inappropriate","id":"inappropriate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication%20review","id":"Medication Review"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/suicidal","id":"suicidal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unprofessional","id":"unprofessional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unsupported","id":"unsupported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health%20crisis","id":"mental health crisis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/involved%20in%20care%20plan","id":"involved in care plan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/consistent%20care","id":"consistent care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/inconsistency","id":"inconsistency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lack%20of%20empathy","id":"lack of empathy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unhelpful%20comments","id":"unhelpful comments"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health%20nurses","id":"mental health nurses"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/937362","id":"937362"}]},{"id":935773,"author":"Still_smiling","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Mixed experience in the emergency department","body":"I was recently admitted by ambulance with suspected neutropenic sepsis, I’m currently having anti-cancer treatment (chemotherapy) for breast cancer. On arrival I was taken to resus, staff were concerned about my risk of infection due to possible neutropenia and tried to isolate me away from other patients, which was much appreciated.  \r\nOne of the doctors was excellent. He explained about neutropenic sepsis. I explained I had a card which details that I should have certain antibiotics immediately (the paramedics were informed of this too). They confirmed they could see this on system.  \r\nThey struggled to get a cannula in due to my poor venous access, I did have a PICC line however, this was not to be used. Unfortunately after several attempts it was unsuccessful and he went to get an ultrasound machine to help. This was in use. therefore I had to wait.  \r\nThey sought help from another doctor who was fantastic. Very reassuring as I was extremely nervous about needing to get the line in for treatment. There were several attempts with the ultrasound machine however, finally successful. The medical staff offered constant reassurance. They were able to take off some bloods for sending to the lab but were unable to obtain blood cultures peripherally. My PICC line wasn’t cultured in A&E either.  \r\nI believe IV fluids were prescribed but I did not get these prior to IV antibiotics.  \r\nI was advised later whilst in ward that my temperature was raised in the Emergency department but I was not offered paracetamol until at least 7:00 pm (more than an hour after arrival). I had advised the team I felt hot and sweaty.  \r\nAntibiotics were prescribed and I had to wait I believe over an hour for these to be administered from prescription, in total approx 3 hours from being in the ambulance.  \r\nI could hear the nursing staff saying they were unsure how it was made up, and they were looking on the computer to gain this information. I also heard from nursing staff that this was one that people can react to. The nursing staff advised one of the antibiotics takes a while to dissolve therefore this was the delay, however I don’t understand why the other antibiotic wasn’t administered while waiting.  \r\nThe night shift staff came on duty. Gary and Leah were fantastic, they created an instantly calm environment and Gary provided reassurance regarding the antibiotics and how I would be monitored.  \r\nIn my opinion there are learning opportunities here.  \r\n1. It would be helpful to source another ultrasound machine for the department  \r\n2. The awareness of the importance of prompt delivery of antibiotics in suspected neutropenic septic patients  \r\n3. Creating an environment that’s reassuring  \r\n4. Prompt delivery of IV fluids and medication such as paracetamol in someone who is pyrexial.  \r\n5. Prompt blood cultures as this increased hospital stay by 1 night as the results were not known  \r\nI have fed this back to oncology team also to gain an understanding of why I went to Emergency department and not straight to ward 32. I am of the understanding this was due to the chest pain I was experiencing.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-05-02T19:36:09.5366667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-05-05T08:31:53.69","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Tayside","count":16},{"name":"Scottish Government","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/935773","id":"935773"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/935773/responses","id":"935773"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/935773/healthservices","id":"935773"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/935773/tags","id":"935773"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/t101h_180","id":"T101H_180","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxious","id":"anxious"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/antibiotics","id":"antibiotics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breast%20cancer","id":"breast cancer"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cancer%20treatment","id":"cancer treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctor","id":"doctor"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/isolation","id":"isolation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/iv%20antibiotics","id":"iv antibiotics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/night%20staff","id":"night staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sepsis","id":"sepsis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/temperature","id":"temperature"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ultrasound","id":"ultrasound"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassuring","id":"reassuring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/delays","id":"delays"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20cultures","id":"blood cultures"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lack%20of%20equipment","id":"lack of equipment"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/938134","id":"938134"}]},{"id":935776,"author":"skynh95","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Disappointing experience","body":"I wish that may experience so far was as positive as the others mentioned.

It was pretty bad and I made my way to A&E in Craigavon.  \r\nFrom the moment I entered the dept I was looked after so well without exception. The lady on reception immediately took me through and a nurse sent me straight to X-ray. Once X-rayed the radiology team ( so kind and patient ) took me back into the nurse where they put me on a trolley and in no time I was given pain relief to breath in and my dislocated shoulder was fixed and put in a sling. All in all I was in the dept no longer than 90 mins. The dept was extremely busy yet the staff managed me so efficiently and with great kindness. I was well informed at every step and my expectations were well managed.  \r\nThe nurses and doctor attending me were extremely professional and took time to explain everything , I am very grateful for their prompt and excellent care.  \r\nToday I spoke on the phone with SR Hagan in Fracture Clinic. She was helpful in it signposting me to Physio , and when I called Physio , I spoke with Stephen who took the time to explain to me the care plan , the timeframe and what to expect going forward. He confirmed my appt in May and helped provide me with reassurance and confidence in the next steps.  \r\nI really want to convey my appreciation and hope this is shared with those involved, their excellent work does not go unnoticed !","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-05-03T13:43:27.7666667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-05-05T09:52:08.027","readBy":[{"name":"Southern Health and Social Care Trust","count":4}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/935918","id":"935918"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/935918/responses","id":"935918"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/935918/healthservices","id":"935918"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/935918/tags","id":"935918"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_32024_180","id":"ZT003_32024_180","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/accident%20&%20emergency","id":"accident & emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care%20plan","id":"care plan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dislocated%20shoulder","id":"dislocated shoulder"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctors","id":"doctors"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/efficient","id":"efficient"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fell","id":"fell"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fracture%20clinic","id":"fracture clinic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kept%20informed","id":"kept informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kind","id":"kind"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/looked%20after","id":"looked after"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain%20relief","id":"pain relief"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/physio","id":"physio"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/radiology","id":"radiology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/receptionist","id":"receptionist"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/x%20ray","id":"x ray"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appreciation","id":"appreciation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confident","id":"confident"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/excellent%20work","id":"excellent work"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/radiology%20team","id":"radiology team"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/prompt%20attention","id":"prompt attention"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/943524","id":"943524"}]},{"id":936204,"author":"Mercury88","authorRoleId":1,"authorRole":"a carer","title":"Unhappy with mental health support","body":"My husbands worker went off sick we wasn’t assigned anyone else.

There were issues with a care package not being available and being caught between two trust areas.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-05-03T15:03:49.7333333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-05-05T10:03:56.28","readBy":[{"name":"Southern Health and Social Care Trust","count":5},{"name":"Ulster University, MBBS (Medicine) 2021","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/935930","id":"935930"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/935930/responses","id":"935930"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/935930/healthservices","id":"935930"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/935930/tags","id":"935930"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_31024_430","id":"ZT003_31024_430","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxious","id":"anxious"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sadness","id":"sadness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scared","id":"scared"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care%20co-ordination","id":"care co-ordination"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care%20package","id":"care package"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/concerned","id":"concerned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dementia","id":"dementia"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diagnosis","id":"diagnosis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/overwhelmed","id":"overwhelmed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/social%20worker","id":"Social Worker"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/940125","id":"940125"}]},{"id":935933,"author":"Tudor81","authorRoleId":3,"authorRole":"a parent/guardian","title":"What I liked most was that she looked at the entire picture","body":"Great service provided by one of the health service staff, Saba.  \r\nWe had an appointment with the Speech and Language Therapist in the community for my baby.

After various blood tests and examinations I was referred for a chest X-ray.  \r\nIt did not show up what was expected (fluid in the lungs) but something else which was unexplained which was a real worry. After this I was referred to the respiratory department at the RAH who arranged a CT scan which was carried out within 5 days of my referral. After this I saw Dr Gravil who explained that the result was inconclusive but she was convinced it was not cancer which was a huge relief. Dr Gravil referred me for pulmonary function tests, which were normal and a bronchoscopy (quite unpleasant) and another scan, which still didn’t give me an answer to my continuing symptoms.  \r\nBy this time Dr Gravil had retired and I was under the care of Dr Grieve, who suggested another X-ray and scan - both of which were still inconclusive. After consulting with his colleagues who examined the scan images I was referred for a PET scan which showed that there was now some improvement in the markings in my lungs.  \r\nThen the decision - I was diagnosed with cryptogenic organising pneumonia and the treatment was steroids.  \r\nNot ever having heard of this condition I looked up the details and was pleased to learn that it was not life threatening and was likely to improve with the steroids.  \r\nFor some months I gradually reduced the dose of steroids and am now off them completely. My symptoms have gone. I feel well, I can climb my stairs without stopping in the middle (which at my worst I couldn’t do), attend to my large garden and keep up with my teenaged grandson!  \r\nI would like to offer my thanks for all the help I received in discovering what was wrong with me - the not giving up, finding what the problem was and providing the treatment which had been successful.  \r\nAll this shows the NHS at its very best - the knowledge and expertise of our local medical staff and their persistence in trying to find answers for me which were far from simple.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-05-03T15:54:50.5233333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-05-05T10:16:22.523","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":9}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/935936","id":"935936"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/935936/responses","id":"935936"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/935936/healthservices","id":"935936"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/935936/tags","id":"935936"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/c418h-outpatients","id":"c418h-outpatients","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scared","id":"scared"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/worried","id":"worried"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breathless","id":"breathless"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bronchoscopy","id":"bronchoscopy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ct%20scan","id":"CT scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diagnosis","id":"diagnosis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/expertise","id":"expertise"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/knowledge","id":"knowledge"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lungs","id":"lungs"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/persistence","id":"Persistence"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/respiratory","id":"respiratory"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scan","id":"scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/x-ray","id":"X-ray"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/relieved","id":"relieved"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/healthier","id":"healthier"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/939222","id":"939222"}]},{"id":935947,"author":"sagittariusje66","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Worrying staff attitude for people with a long term condition","body":"There was an incident in the ward.

Other staff present were laughing or trying to calm the patient down. No-one spoke to the nurse. No-one tried to reassure other patients. The patient may have been rude, but she was on the dialysis machine and was not a risk to anyone. Staff should have stepped away or de-escalated, instead of shouting back. It could have gone horribly wrong.  \r\nIt was very unpleasant and scary to witness. It made me feel unsafe and added to a very chaotic atmosphere in the ward. I feel, just because we are long term patients with no other option, staff can be nonchalant.  \r\nThe nurses often advise us that we need to wait patiently for our transport, and that this is not a five star service. Most people are very thankful for NHS. It is rude to talk like this or be impatient with people who do not speak English.

Eventually the biopsy was cancelled an hour before starting as the blood tests needed had not been done despite the patient querying this during one of the many calls.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-05-03T18:39:23","progress":"Made change","dateOfPublication":"2022-05-05T11:03:27.143","readBy":[{"name":"Royal Berkshire NHS Foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/936005","id":"936005"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/936005/responses","id":"936005"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/936005/healthservices","id":"936005"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/936005/tags","id":"936005"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rhw01_101","id":"RHW01_101","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/biopsy","id":"biopsy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20tests","id":"blood tests"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cancelled","id":"cancelled"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cancer","id":"cancer"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/excellent%20care","id":"excellent care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/information","id":"information"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mixed%20feelings","id":"mixed feelings"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unhelpful","id":"unhelpful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/urology","id":"urology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/adminstration","id":"adminstration"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/937390","id":"937390"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/937524","id":"937524"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1013936","id":"1013936"}]},{"id":936000,"author":"mckeown1990","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Helpful groups and activities","body":"I was very nervous when I first came but was made to feel welcome and settled in well.

The thought it would be best for me to be admitted into Craigavon area hospital so that they are able to investigate the possibility of blood clots or lung cancer. My GP was great as they were able to contact them to expect me.  \r\nMy sister drove me to hospital and I arrived at about 1:30pm. I was seen immediately by a lovely nurse and was examined by the doctor.  \r\nWithin 8 hours I was thoroughly examined, had an X-ray, ECG and CT scan. Their opinion was that I was suffering a blood clot.  \r\nI am preparing to go into surgery, the staff are very kind and they have been very supportive and are always keeping my family up-to-date with all that is happening. Everyone I have seen has been so attentive and kind. To have been given so much attention and investigation in such a short time and be diagnosed, in my opinion, quite amazing and I cannot praise everyone who saw me too highly.

Attended a pre op assessment, answered many in depth questions about my health. Explained I had had some cardiac tests over the last few years which despite a small leaky valve issue the Cardio department had written to my GP with no cause for concern. As the assessment nurse could not see any of this on their files, I suggested they contact Cardio to check out all was well with my heart health. I attended for my operation 5 days later, met the anaesthetist who, after many of the same pre op questions and looking at my records said they would be very, very worried about anaesthetising me due to a heart problem (he showed me some paperwork) from my last cardio dept. scan. My operation was cancelled there & then after a 2 year wait. Why was this heart issue not picked up at the pre op as I specifically asked them to check? Why was I not informed by cardio of this apparently serious event in my health ? This total lack of organisation resulted in massive waste of NHS time and money/resources and a missed opportunity for someone else who'd perhaps been waiting years for surgery to receive treatment in my place on the day.  \r\nThis has caused huge distress to me after a long, stressful and painful wait for treatment and I left the hospital in tears, feeling sick and frankly angry....not at the team on the morning who were lovely but the lack of care/feedback/attention to important details pre op. I now also have the worry about a heart issue detailed in my records I was not aware of and more waits for treatment. I am a realist, (perfection does not exist in any organisation) I would have been understanding if my non urgent op had been cancelled on the day due to emergency/unforeseen staff problems.  \r\nThis type of event should not be happening to any patient due to admin issues. I have contacted the Cardiology dept and PALS, left messages Answerphones and await responses.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-05-04T05:06:22.73","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2022-05-05T11:54:54.96","readBy":[],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/936121","id":"936121"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/936121/responses","id":"936121"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/936121/healthservices","id":"936121"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/936121/tags","id":"936121"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rcf22_100","id":"RCF22_100","score":3},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cancelled%20operation","id":"cancelled operation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cardiology","id":"cardiology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/day%20surgery","id":"day surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/laparoscopy","id":"laparoscopy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pre-op%20assessment","id":"pre-op assessment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting","id":"waiting"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20disappointed","id":"very disappointed"}]},{"id":936124,"author":"Baillie_12woof","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Skin cancer in back","body":"Got Ah small section off skin cancer cut out my back by David the Surgeon,he was 1st class n really put me at ease with the 30 minute op, theyre we’re 2 nurses on hand to help out -Lynda n Megan ,overall was really pleased with the 1st class service that ah received from the 3 mentioned, ah really worrying time but was put at ease with the staff involved 👏thanx again 🤒","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-05-04T06:13:29.6666667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-05-05T11:56:24.547","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Forth Valley","count":4},{"name":"MASScot- Melanoma Action and Support Scotland","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/936124","id":"936124"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/936124/responses","id":"936124"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/936124/healthservices","id":"936124"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/936124/tags","id":"936124"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sv9-outpatient-centre-dermatology","id":"sv9-outpatient-centre-dermatology","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/first%20class","id":"first class"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/skin%20cancer","id":"skin cancer"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/timely%20treatment","id":"timely treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20ease","id":"at ease"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/937721","id":"937721"}]},{"id":936126,"author":"Stedd64","authorRoleId":8,"authorRole":"a staff member posting for a patient/service user","title":"Marvellous Support","body":"Hi there,  \r\nI had or still have a severe mental health diagnosis.  \r\nI liked that no one judged me and there were people listening to me.  \r\nI expect and give punctuality if someone is on leave I expect that the meeting to be cancelled or actually the service user informed if you can not attend it.

I, as Power of Attorney, had the welfare powers activated by the onward Consultant confirming ongoing cognitive decline in my mother and that it was appropriate for me to make welfare decisions.  \r\nThe nurse on ward 14 declined to pass the Adults with Incapacity Section 47 form to me as they stated this was private and refused to do so. This was despite knowing that I had activated Powers of Attorney, was arranging the Care Home my mother was being admitted to and that I was expected to arrange transport and payment as this was out of area.  \r\nThey would not permit me access to the AWI but stated they would send this to the care home manager. My mother was discharged to the care home on a Friday. Her covid vaccination booster injection was due on the following Tuesday at the care home, and because the AWI was incorrect and out of date she was not permitted the vaccine. The nurse had sent the wrong one, from a previous admission in Dec 2021, not one that would cover her treatment in March. If I had been passed this one I could have advised the ward that this was incorrect and had it amended prior to discharge.  \r\nMy mother was transferred to a different part of Scotland and therefore required to be registered to a different health board. The AWI was wrong, there was no DNACPR passed over on discharge, and the medications were for one week only, which is very little time considering the relocation and requirements for registering with a new health centre, and health board.  \r\nI have liaised with the new health centre to acquire a new AWI and DNACPR and arrange covid vaccination booster, however this has taken time and has left my mother without the appropriate safeguards in place to ensure appropriate medical treatments.  \r\nToday I have had a review with the person who reviews patients discharged to care homes. When I informed the person of the poor paperwork for discharge they advised that they were not surprised and that about 60% of the people reviewed have similar cases of inept and poor discharge experiences. When asked if they would pass this over to their Team Manager, Service Manager or Head of Service they did not seem inclined to do so.  \r\nI therefore believe that discharge from Ward 14 can be improved, with staff given training in legislation re Powers of Attorney. Also for appropriate AWI/DNACPR and medications for the person to be put in place as routine. Unlike the review person today I find it unacceptable that people discharged from hospital at a time of need are not supported appropriately, and it is disappointing if they feel this is commonplace and not a matter of concern. Inappropriate and poor discharge causes further issues with the person's health,and distress both to them and their families  \r\n","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-05-03T20:50:37.7333333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-05-05T12:02:37.18","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":10}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/936017","id":"936017"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/936017/responses","id":"936017"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/936017/healthservices","id":"936017"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/936017/tags","id":"936017"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/c206h_430","id":"C206H_430","score":3},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disappointed","id":"disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/distressing","id":"distressing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frustrated","id":"frustrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/failure","id":"failure"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/information","id":"information"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/poor%20discharge%20arrangements","id":"poor discharge arrangements"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/section","id":"section"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20knowledge","id":"staff knowledge"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20training","id":"staff training"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vaccination","id":"vaccination"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unsafe","id":"unsafe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid","id":"covid"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lack%20of%20concern","id":"lack of concern"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/936850","id":"936850"}]},{"id":936129,"author":"HammondFarm","authorRoleId":4,"authorRole":"a relative","title":"Thank you for the care given to my late Mother","body":"I would like to share our overdue thanks for the care given to our late Mother - Janet.

I was really grateful for this and wanted to say thank you for going above to help me as I know waiting lists for appointments are difficult enough as it is due to covid.  \r\nAlthough my tooth was more difficult to extract than anticipated Rachel made me feel at ease and was a genuinely lovely person, talking me through everything and making small talk to distract me from the procedure. At all stages of the extraction she made sure I was as comfortable as possible and checked multiple times I wasn't in pain. I would also like to thank Luke who popped through to lend a hand and also the dental nurse who (sorry I cant remember her name) was equally as lovely and caring.  \r\nI just wanted to say thank you to you all as although it wasn't the most pleasant way to spend a bank holiday, everyone I dealt with before hand and on the day really did make the whole experience bearable. Hopefully I wont need any of my other wisdom teeth out but if I do I would be happy to come back and be cared for by any of the team. I think a lot of people think wisdom tooth extraction is horrific so I thought it might be helpful to read a positive experience which may put someone a bit more at ease.  \r\nThanks again to all the team!","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-05-04T11:50:38.3633333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-05-05T12:52:21.423","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lanarkshire","count":4}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/936187","id":"936187"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/936187/responses","id":"936187"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/936187/healthservices","id":"936187"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/936187/tags","id":"936187"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l106h_450","id":"L106H_450","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/caring","id":"caring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dental","id":"dental"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/informed","id":"informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kind%20staff","id":"kind staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/orthodontic","id":"orthodontic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/positive","id":"positive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professional","id":"professional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/teeth","id":"teeth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tooth","id":"tooth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tooth%20extraction","id":"Tooth extraction"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wisdom","id":"wisdom"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wisdom%20teeth","id":"wisdom teeth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20for","id":"cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20ease","id":"at ease"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/comfortable","id":"comfortable"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/936563","id":"936563"}]},{"id":936192,"author":"puppisfe73","authorRoleId":4,"authorRole":"a relative","title":"Mum was diagnosis","body":"After going to the doctor for blood test, mum was sent to hospital for X-rays, scans and further test.  \r\nOnce the results came back we were then told about her cancer.  \r\nWe were absolutely devastated, shocked and just couldn’t believe this was happening to her, our whole life’s were turned upside down in the matter off weeks, our hearts were broken and still are, trying to deal with the fact she can not be cured only treated.

I am also deaf, wear hearing aids & have always tried to cope on my own without help mostly succeeding. Covid has meant face masks, muffled voices & no lip reading. Last year I had an emergency appointment for possible bladder &/or kidney cancer & started on the various investigations. I knew that I would be highly stressed in hospital so I emailed PALS repeatedly to ask what help I could have or for someone to contact. Instead I was directed to the learning disability officers...  \r\nI then had an emergency admission for sepsis. The first few days were difficult as staff refused to make reasonable adjustments for my deafness. I was told off for missing breakfast because I must have misunderstood and should have known. I was told off for asking for a written menu because I couldn't hear menu items listed verbally. I asked for my bed to be labelled with the deaf sign in accordance with the legal NHS Accessible Information standard, 2016, which ensures that all communication needs due to disability are met, this was refused because it was demeaning and would make me vulnerable. I did feed all these problems back to the hospital and got an apology.  \r\nNext I had a kidney biopsy. My previous one had been painful as the anesthesia did not work. I was very nervous of being on a ward close to others after so long isolating. The hospital had forgotten to book my pre op pcr test so I did not even know if the procedure would still go ahead. I had a wasted journey for the non-existent covid test. I was not tested for covid until after being admitted to the ward. My husband had to translate most of the pre-op clerking in questions because I could not understand the nurse. Another nurse kept drawing back the cubicle curtains because he wanted to plug in his computer station and I repeatedly explained to him that I needed them drawn in order to feel calmer.  \r\nThe biopsy went ok but afterwards I had to remain flat in bed on the ward for 4 hours to prevent hemorrhaging. During this time my husband was made to sit outside the open ward entrance despite helping me communicate and being my carer. I then looked at my day notes and discovered that there was nothing about my deafness in them despite the proactive emails, my previous hospital stay, complaint and my husband and I verbally explaining to the nurses. Also the deaf sticker that is supposed to be on the notes was missing. When I tried to explain to the nurse what was missing, I was told that deafness was nothing to do with her or the hospital but it was for my GP to deal with. They then moved further away so that I could no longer hear her and refused to discuss this any further.  \r\nI eventually managed to remove my blood pressure cuff despite only partial use and strength of that arm, in an attempt to engage her in further conversation as I knew she would have to explain why she had had done the BP readings every 15 minutes. Instead another nurse came, who was obviously cross with me but I could not understand what she was saying from that distance. I repeatedly begged her to allow my husband back in as I needed his help communicating due to being deaf. This was denied.  \r\nUnbeknown to me my husband had offered to help but was told to go away and security was called. Finally another nurse realised that I might be upset and let my husband in. He manage to calm me down, panic attack reduced when the guards arrived, not wearing masks despite my CEV covid status and anxieties, ripped back the cubicle curtains, stood next to me before leaving. I was terrified, trapped in a corner by staff and guards and not knowing what was going on, there was no way to escape so another panic attack.  \r\nSince then I need sedating for my hospital appointments and before my kidney cancer surgery. My husband has to remain with me for all my appointments. I will not visit anywhere on my own without him, cancel appointments that I think I can etc. I panic at the prospect of dealing with any stranger even on the phone and now refuse to answer it when it rings. I just freeze and hyperventilate until it finally stops.  \r\nNow he needs cancer surgery but I cannot support him in hospital or even visit him and he does not want me to try either. This makes me very, very upset.  \r\nCBT should be starting soon but I do not know if it will help, already maxed out on antidepressants plus diazepam for hospital use.  \r\nThe hospital have admitted noncompliance with the NHS AIS but then the hospital manager wrote to me concerning my other complaint about the multiple mistakes and excuses made for not providing the prebiopsy covid screening and I felt used the this opportunity to berate me for being a naughty girl on the day of my biopsy. I do not feel that taking part on the hospital's newly formed Deaf Working Party to discuss improvements will work with the senior manager so hostile. I am prepared to try and work with the hospital to improve things for other people if the senior manager retracts this criticism of me. Telling the staff, patients etc about the AIS with posters, leaflets and information in their website would be a start. This has still not happened after 6 months. No staff have received any training in the AIS since it was introduced in 2016 and the hospital are still non-compliant. My concern is that nothing will be done until they have the perfect computer system to support the AIS rather than incorporating some measures for staff to follow now.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-05-03T18:04:04.8966667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-05-05T13:02:36.223","readBy":[{"name":"Royal Berkshire NHS Foundation Trust","count":1},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2022)","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/936001","id":"936001"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/936001/responses","id":"936001"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/936001/healthservices","id":"936001"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/936001/tags","id":"936001"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rhw01","id":"RHW01","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxious","id":"anxious"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nervous","id":"nervous"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scared","id":"scared"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stressed","id":"stressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/antidepressants","id":"antidepressants"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appointments","id":"appointments"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/biopsy","id":"biopsy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bladder","id":"bladder"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cancer","id":"cancer"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/deaf","id":"deaf"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/deafness","id":"deafness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disability","id":"disability"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency","id":"emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/failure","id":"failure"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hearing","id":"hearing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kidney","id":"kidney"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kidney%20biopsy","id":"Kidney biopsy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kidney%20cancer","id":"kidney cancer"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mobility","id":"mobility"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurse","id":"nurse"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pals","id":"pals"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/panic%20attack","id":"panic attack"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sepsis","id":"sepsis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/transplant","id":"Transplant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/traumatised","id":"traumatised"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cancer%20surgery","id":"cancer surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/adjustments","id":"adjustments"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%20test","id":"covid test"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid-19%20test","id":"covid-19 test"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%2019","id":"covid 19"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/939644","id":"939644"}]},{"id":936238,"author":"Alexe98","authorRoleId":8,"authorRole":"a staff member posting for a patient/service user","title":"The Care is Second to None","body":"The care could not be improved, it was second to one.

So many things I can speak about so do bear with me during this little ramble.  \r\nFirst of all, I was quoted a 12 week wait and only waited 8 before picking the chair up today. Which is absolutely brilliant and i’m really glad that Westmarc are able to hit under the target wait times.  \r\nMy chair is a Quickie Argon 2 in Flamingo Glitter. I nearly started sobbing upon seeing it! It was absolutely everything I could ever ask for in a chair. It has a 3 inch camber, foldable push handles, a swing away anti tipper, a static singular footplate and the perfect sized castors (I think 3/4 inches?)  \r\nI felt such a massive difference in my seating position and felt so much more comfortable in this chair. I felt like I was gliding on the ground. I tried it in the little gym hall thingie over the bricks and didn’t feel a single bump. It was so incredibly smooth. The new brakes are brilliant and feel much more stable than my previous chair. It feels like i’m sitting IN the chair, instead of on top of it. It feels as if it’s a part of me instead of an external accessory. And oh my goodness, cannot say thank you enough for the beautiful colour. Who knew a bright pastel pink with ACTUAL glitter would be provided by the NHS?! The colour choices are absolutely amazing and i’m so thankful I got to pick this beautiful colour.  \r\nAll in all, I cannot say thank you enough. This chair will (and has already in the hour I’ve had it) changed my life. Not only does it meet all my needs in the technical essence, but it fits my personality and I don’t feel ashamed or embarrassed of my chair.

After realising I was actually experiencing PTSD I have learned so many coping strategies to help manage this as well as help me through the lowest part of my life.  \r\nGemma is a kind person who is a credit to her team and the NHS. She listened to me, and she would let me open up whilst giving me the tools to help myself. And that’s the most important thing.  \r\nI think when you are a health professional you never think you will struggle with your health, I struggled to even admit I was struggling. The patience I was shown by Gemma gave me the confidence I needed to acknowledge my feelings and feel them.  \r\nWhilst I do still have some anxiety and low mood this is something I know I can cope with and will improve. Gemma helped me figure out some of the triggers to my PTSD and each therapy session helped me even when there were ups and downs.  \r\nOne of the most important things was that I was able to stay in work (whilst also taking some leave) which if I didn’t seek help from psychology I would not have been able to do.  \r\nI cannot thank Gemma enough for all the effort she put in for me. Truly patient centred care at its best.  \r\nMy family and me will be forever grateful for that whole team and it doesn’t get said enough, so thank you.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-05-03T16:24:46.5633333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-05-05T13:36:51.737","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lanarkshire","count":8},{"name":"Scottish Recovery Network","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/935949","id":"935949"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/935949/responses","id":"935949"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/935949/healthservices","id":"935949"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/935949/tags","id":"935949"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sl9-adult-mental-health","id":"SL9-adult-mental-health","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/acknowledgement","id":"acknowledgement"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/best","id":"best"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/coping%20strategies","id":"Coping strategies"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/empathy","id":"empathy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/felt%20listened%20to","id":"felt listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kindness","id":"kindness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/low%20mood","id":"Low mood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/patient-centred","id":"patient-centred"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/psychology","id":"psychology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ptsd","id":"ptsd"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/self%20help","id":"self help"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/triggers","id":"triggers"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confidence","id":"confidence"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/patience","id":"patience"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/whole%20team","id":"whole team"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/struggling","id":"struggling"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20tools","id":"given tools"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/credit%20to%20the%20company","id":"credit to the company"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/forever%20grateful","id":"forever grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/therapy%20sessions","id":"therapy sessions"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pandemic","id":"pandemic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/able%20to%20manage%20feelings","id":"able to manage feelings"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/time%20and%20effort","id":"time and effort"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/936564","id":"936564"}]},{"id":936271,"author":"slidesm57","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Treatment from the start has been excellent","body":"In 2008 Dr Down was not happy with the PSA result.

A meeting in Exeter decided on Radiation treatment rather than an operation to remove prostate hormone treatment & radiation to be carried out in Exeter.  \r\n37 trips to Exeter. This was tiring but the radiation staff were excellent. Ongoing monitoring of PSA levels carried out with regular meetings with Dr Martinez or Dr Sheenan. Dr Sheenan was really good more like a friend than doctor  \r\nAbout 2 years ago my monitoring was taken over by urology dept.  \r\nRecent test shows increase in PSA level.  \r\nMrs Dring referred to oncology who suggested new scans.  \r\nThese have been arranged in the next two weeks.  \r\nI can only say that my treatment from the start has been excellent. The only improvement I could suggest is that it is a pity that there is no bone scanner at Barnstaple. nor can radiation treatment be done there.

Not only is their online \"24/7\" service down and has been for 2 months at this point, they refuse to schedule any appointments with the GPs regardless of the urgency of the appointment.  \r\nI have been without antidepressants for 4 weeks now, and not out of mismanagement on my behalf, not at all. I've needed to go in for a medicine review and they refuse to prescribe more without seeing me - including antidepressants, contraceptive pill, and Metformin. I am now without two of my medicines and have been in contact with NHS 111 in tears, begging them to help me get an appointment anywhere else just to be prescribed the medicine keeping me from killing myself. Unfortunately, it's outside of their control.  \r\nThe GP appears to be absolutely fine with letting their patients go into medicine withdrawal and potentially lose patients because of it. Not to mention their \"accessible\" website is the exact opposite. Without providing the online 24/7 service, they're restricting the independence of patients who are deaf/hard of hearing or those with chronic social anxieties, preventing them from making phone calls and may not necessarily have anyone around them who will do it for them. I find it a frankly disgusting service. I have begged the receptionist to please just try to fit me in or book me in anywhere, but they simply refused and hung up on me. The last time I managed to get a phone appointment (4 weeks ago and with no lack of trying), I waited on it all day until I had to go to work. At 21:45 I got a phone call from a withheld number whilst I'm driving and miss the phone call. This turns out to be the phone appointment. At damn near 10:00pm. I was never told the phone calls could be that late and simply assumed my appointment had been forgotten, for which I was planning to complain the next day.  \r\nNow, it's the same phone call every week where I call the surgery, get told there are no appointments, and no I can't book a future appointment. I call at 8:30 in the morning and there are no appointments. I am told to call back next week when the schedule is available. I would just like to say that my mental health is at the point of breaking, and I've thought about the worst several times just this morning. This medical practice is disgusting. I wouldn't treat my worst enemy like this.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-05-04T05:54:46.62","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2022-05-05T14:00:31.107","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Forth Valley","count":4},{"name":"Scottish Recovery Network","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/936122","id":"936122"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/936122/responses","id":"936122"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/936122/healthservices","id":"936122"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/936122/tags","id":"936122"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sv9-gp","id":"sv9-gp","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/despairing","id":"despairing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/access%20to%20services","id":"access to services"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/antidepressants","id":"antidepressants"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appointments","id":"appointments"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/contraceptive%20pill","id":"contraceptive pill"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/devastated","id":"devastated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication%20review","id":"Medication Review"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nhs%20111","id":"NHS 111"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/online%20service","id":"online service"}]},{"id":936307,"author":"venusyf47","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Excellent service","body":"Inclusion was + continues to be very helpful.

A senior assessment nurse, Mhairi, arrived and took all the information, stats and bloods. Next came a consultant and finally Gillian came back to fit a catheter and therefore avoiding my mum being admitted to hospital .  \r\nAll members of the team treated my mum with the utmost respect and displayed a level of professionalism whilst being sympathetic to her condition . I would like to say a huge thank you to the professionals for such an outstanding job. In times when the NHS is often under fire, I cannot rate them highly enough.
