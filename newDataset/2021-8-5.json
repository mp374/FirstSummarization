I was unimpressed from my first visit with the reception staff unhelpful, abrupt and expected me to know how the practice works (eg when to call for appts, test results etc). I couldn’t believe the reception team were behind glass meaning you had to shout through the glass to be heard in front of other patients in the waiting room. I’d never seen this in a practice before. Very off putting. Every time I booked an appointment when I fell ill with a condition I had previously I was given an appt with a different GP each time as no-one seemed to be there from one appt to the next - twice in a row were locams as I was told two of the regular GPs were off long term sick. My condition led to mental health issues and I repeatedly had to “battle” through the receptionists to even try and get an appointment to see a Doctor who went straight down the anti-depressant route disappointingly; again no continuity of the same GP despite requesting so everytime having to start from scratch explaining and a nightmare to review medication. It got to the point it was putting me off going. I therefore made the upheaval of moving to City Centre Health Centre and what a difference it made for the better - continuity of one GP all the time, worked with me on mental health therapies to find the right ones not relying on anti-depressants and dud required referrals immediately with regular follow up from the surgery. I wouldn’t recommend this practice to anyone (unconnected to the pandemic causing issues, these issues were there before).

I felt that I was assessed holistically, I was listened too and so was my husband. We had a say in the care and investigations in the plan going forward.\nAs a retired nurse of 30 years, I appreciate and understand the pressure that all areas of the NHS are under. It’s does have to be said, that GP practices are the first port of call for illness and services to encourage and maintain a healthy life style. They are also there to help the sick and vulnerable of which I am one and I have appreciated the recent vaccination program that was run at the practice as it was EXCELLENT. I did write to the practice manager to let them know too. I myself have needed an appointment and understood that a phone call - which is on time, with a caring and careful voice of a practitioner has worked and I prefer it as I don’t like to take up valuable time in the surgery unless really necessary. When attending the practice for an appointment, the centre is clean, tidy and the reception staff are friendly and helpful and will go out of their way to help you. Each practice room is well equipped and there is enough room/for my wheelchair, which really helps. The nursing team (all grades) are so positive, smiling, proactive, and they have helped with any request. My husband I feel confident in their care and we appreciate the holistic assessment, planning, implementation and evaluation of the plan of care that we have received for various conditions that we unfortunately have affecting our health. Coming from a nursing and teaching background, we appreciate the realistic challenges you have had and are still/having due to COVID 19 and thank you ALL for everything that you have ad are continuing to do. Thank you for the smiles you have on your faces on difficult days, thank you for the kindness you show on the hard, challenging and emotional days, thank you Health Care Team, we appreciate you and hope that in the coming months the current situation will have become easier for you all and all the services within the NHS. My husband and I will both continue wearing our face masks as we respect that you have to wear yours, and both sides are then providing protection to themselves and others. Thank you once again. Stay safe.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2021-07-20T16:08:48","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-08-05T09:50:27","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/868500","id":"868500"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/868500/responses","id":"868500"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/868500/healthservices","id":"868500"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/868500/tags","id":"868500"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/j84011","id":"J84011","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20listened%20to","id":"not listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care%20plan","id":"care plan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/excellent","id":"excellent"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/face","id":"face"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helped","id":"helped"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/positive","id":"positive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/safe","id":"safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/smiling","id":"smiling"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vaccination","id":"vaccination"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vulnerable","id":"vulnerable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wheelchair","id":"wheelchair"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appreciated","id":"appreciated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confident","id":"confident"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hope","id":"Hope"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/smiles","id":"smiles"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/no%20hope","id":"no hope"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid","id":"covid"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%2019","id":"covid 19"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/under%20pressure","id":"under pressure"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/899272","id":"899272"}]},{"id":868499,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Appointments","body":"Very difficult to get an appointment-had to wait 12 days for an urgent problem - I am 85 and have mobility problems.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2021-07-30T15:32:43","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-08-05T09:51:06","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/868499","id":"868499"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/868499/responses","id":"868499"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/868499/healthservices","id":"868499"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/868499/tags","id":"868499"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/c84072","id":"C84072","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mobility","id":"mobility"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/871552","id":"871552"}]},{"id":868501,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Phlebotomy ","body":"I am extremely needle-phobic, the lovely guy who took my blood was so understanding when I went a bit faint and clammy he made me feel at ease.

I have to put in a request 10 days before and enter a lottery, sorry, waiting list for an appointment. This will often result in days when I can’t attend or having to delay the appointment for another week, not ideal. Then comes the usual phone call to say they have to cancel the appointment due to no nurse at the practice. This has become the norm to the extent I now expect a call on the day and no longer believe any appointment time I’m given until I’m actually in the room with them. Luckily I drive as an appointment at your local surgery is rare. Covid is blamed but this problem existed long before covid and sounds more like a lack of resources and forward planning. In fact the only time things worked well was during lockdown when I just had to ring on the day. The online system is hit and miss, I requested an appointment with a GP, 3 weeks laterI queried this to be told a phone appointment has been made & cancelled on the system all without any contact being made. I understand things are difficult right now but I work in an environment where we book clinics 3-6 months ahead and have done throughout the past year so I know it is entirely possible. Is my problem an isolated event? Definitely not if I go by what I hear on a regular basis.

Having seen 2 GPs for different things, and once for my son, I can only say how efficient, proactive and genuinely concerned for their patients welfare they are. Getting appointments have never been an issue here and even during covid, phone appointments and face to face when necessary have been straight forward to book. The level of care I have received this week has been phenomenal, with the GP taking time to call me and text numerous times in the day to ensure I was ok and even still working at 10pm to check all was well. On both accounts if they hadn’t have acted as quickly as they did, the outcome could have been much different. I should add that it’s not just the Drs who work tirelessly to help us too, the reception team are always friendly and approachable, nothings ever too much trouble. They work so hard and as a whole, it’s clear to see the surgery work well as a team.

I was instructed by my GP to ring an ambulance to take me, however my wife was happy to drive me up to the accident and emergency department. The department had been made aware that I was coming and I think this had a lot to do with how quickly I was seen to and my needs facilitated. It took about 2 hrs to be seen to by a doctor which is pretty quick given my past experiences in the a&e department.  \r\nThe doctor was very nice and I felt that he was very sincere and genuine with what he said. Once I was seen to I was given a bed in one of the bays down in a&e. It isn't terribly comfortable down there. It is very chaotic and not very relaxing and it's hard to get proper privacy hence, I was delighted when the nurses told me there was a bed available on this ward. I was short of breath down in the a&e department but the doctors and nurses tended to my needs and gave me the medication I needed to feel more comfortable.  \r\nI waited for around 24 hrs before I was transferred to the ward. Since I have been up here I feel much more comfortable and at peace. I cannot fault the staff because they are superb. I couldn't say a bad word about them. They are helpful and attentive and answer all my questions to the best of their ability. I couldn't ask for any better care. They really couldn't do enough for you even though they were under extreme pressure managing many other patients. Everything was well explained and I felt that I was informed about everything regarding my treatment. I wasn't left wondering and having to figure things out for myself. They gave me great advice and guidance.  \r\nThe ward is spotlessly clean and very comfortable. I have always felt safe and satisfied in my own personal area on the ward. I feel content where I am.  \r\nThe food I would say is good the majority of the time. I would say 80% of the food is enjoyable and totally fine. There is relatively good variety so I have always been able to get an alternative option if I don't like something in particular.  \r\nOverall there have been no negatives aspects of my experience in hospital and I cannot think of any big changes I could suggest that would've made my experience any more positive.","criticality":"minimally critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-08-02T14:33:20.8066667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-08-05T10:48:39.99","readBy":[{"name":"Southern Health and Social Care Trust","count":4},{"name":"Public Health Agency","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/867600","id":"867600"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/867600/responses","id":"867600"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/867600/healthservices","id":"867600"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/867600/tags","id":"867600"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_32024_180","id":"ZT003_32024_180","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_32024-east-1-gynae","id":"zt003_32024-east-1-gynae","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/a&e","id":"a&e"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/accident","id":"accident"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/beds","id":"beds"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cleanliness","id":"cleanliness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/comfort","id":"comfort"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/delighted","id":"delighted"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctor","id":"doctor"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency","id":"emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/food","id":"food"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good","id":"good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/great","id":"great"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/positive","id":"positive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/privacy","id":"privacy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/safe","id":"safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/seen%20quickly","id":"seen quickly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20satisfied","id":"very satisfied"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happy","id":"happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/satisfied","id":"satisfied"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fine","id":"fine"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/870216","id":"870216"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/870245","id":"870245"}]},{"id":867581,"author":"Madhound","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Two A&E departments within 24 hours for the same injury","body":"At lincoln a few things were said but did not happen. Went with a badly cut knee cap caused by hedge cutter. First doctor in grey scrubs looked at cut very uncertain at what to do eventually said going to ask advice from senior colleague.  \r\nOn return said got to stop bleeding which was very bad left me alone. Two other staff came after discussion among themselves told me to lie on patients bed wrong way round with leg elevated on head end(thought they was talking about someone else when talking among themselves ) leave leg up there 20-40 mins should stop bleeding. They then left. After a very long time another member came surprised nobody been to see me. Doctor came sometime later, ordered tetanus injections compression dressing then to go home. After sometime staff came dressed wound and sent home.  \r\nWound still bleeding profusely.  \r\nHad to go Norwich A&E the next evening dressing absolutely soaking with blood stained my outer clothing it was that bad.  \r\nSecond doctor most concerned that still bleeding, X-rays ordered and tetanus without me asking. X ray completed doctor came and took ultrasound because small metal fragment found but this found to be old injury.  \r\nNurse arrived with the first of two tetanus injections. Doctor arrived said what they were going to do as in dressing and that got to keep off leg keep it elevated for 2-3 days to allow injury to start to heal because it is right across knee cap cannot glue or stitch wound because of movement. Also if knee changed in any way ie swelling, heating up, redness etc go straight back to N&N.  \r\nI felt really assured and confident of advice given none of this at Lincoln.  \r\nIf only gone to Lincoln could have done real damage to knee no advice given.  \r\nSecond tetanus injection served and told can go home now.  \r\nPleased but saddened that I had to visit two departments (both very lengthy time wise expected but second should have been unnecessary ) within 24hrs with same injury. Pleased that second visit got comprehensive instructions totally lacking first visit.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-08-02T13:39:42.6066667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-08-05T10:56:05.783","readBy":[{"name":"United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust","count":4},{"name":"Norfolk and Norwich University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/867581","id":"867581"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/867581/responses","id":"867581"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/867581/healthservices","id":"867581"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/867581/tags","id":"867581"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rm102_180","id":"RM102_180","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rwdda_180","id":"RWDDA_180","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/advice","id":"advice"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bleeding","id":"bleeding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood","id":"blood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/concerned","id":"concerned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/head","id":"head"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hospital%20discharge","id":"hospital discharge"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/leg","id":"leg"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/saddened","id":"Saddened"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20pleased","id":"very pleased"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/x%20ray","id":"x ray"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/x-rays","id":"x-rays"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confident","id":"confident"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pleased","id":"pleased"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/conflicting%20advice","id":"conflicting advice"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20home","id":"at home"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/874701","id":"874701"}]},{"id":867625,"author":"Treyj95","authorRoleId":8,"authorRole":"a staff member posting for a patient/service user","title":"Ward staff are super","body":"Overall, the only word I can use to describe my experience in Craigavon Hospital is brilliant. I have myeloma so have been in and out of hospital quite a lot and I think Craigavon Hospital is the best hospital there is.  \r\nI came from the mandeville unit to resus and was then transferred to the accident and emergency unit. I waited a number of hrs before I was given a bed in a side room on this ward.  \r\nThe staff were excellent. They were pragmatic and tried to get me sorted as quickly as they could. They listened to everything I had to say and responded with great advice and a plan for my treatment. I have anaemia so have been getting blood transfusions and the staff have kept me in the loop with when that will be so I have time to prepare myself. I am in a side room as I am very immunocompromised and for infection control purposes it is thought that I am safer being away from others. This can be quite lonely and isolating but staff are very friendly and they constantly pop in and out as a reminder that they are still there. Even when they are running past thinking of the 100 things they have to do, they always give me a wave or shout a hello. It is reassuring to know that people are genuinely looking out for you as hospital stays can be extremely daunting. When I mention staff I mean everyone working who keeps the show on road. From the cleaners and porters to the kitchen staff and finally the doctors and nurses, they have all individually had an impact on my experience in hospital. They are all extremely professional and I think what they do is a real vocation.  \r\nMy ward space is clean and tidy. It is comfortable and I have no complaints. The only good thing about having a side room is that it is very private and you have your own space.  \r\nThe food is good and I would have no objections about it. It is what you expect from a hospital which cares for 100s of patients and serves a purpose.  \r\nThe wifi works very well for me and staff were able to help me set it up on my IPAD. This is a very useful facility to have in the hospital as it is a good way of entertaining yourself during the very long days.  \r\nI have no negative experiences to report apart from long waiting times which would obviously be brilliant if they could be sped up in an ideal world. I am aware however of the fact it simply takes time to organise things and I am aware that staff try their absolute best to do what they can despite their lack of resources.","criticality":"minimally critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-08-02T15:05:01.3366667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-08-05T11:07:13.383","readBy":[{"name":"Southern Health and Social Care Trust","count":6}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/867625","id":"867625"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/867625/responses","id":"867625"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/867625/healthservices","id":"867625"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/867625/tags","id":"867625"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_32024_180","id":"ZT003_32024_180","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_32024_370","id":"ZT003_32024_370","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_32024-east-1-gynae","id":"zt003_32024-east-1-gynae","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/a&e","id":"a&e"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/accident","id":"accident"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anaemia","id":"anaemia"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood","id":"blood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency","id":"emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/food","id":"food"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/infection","id":"infection"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kind%20staff","id":"kind staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/myeloma","id":"myeloma"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting%20times","id":"waiting times"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/well%20looked%20after","id":"well looked after"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wifi","id":"wifi"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassuring","id":"reassuring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/listened%20to","id":"listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/clean","id":"clean"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/870215","id":"870215"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/870246","id":"870246"}]},{"id":867680,"author":"Hannah9374","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Stokemandivile NICU","body":"I felt really strongly that I wanted to leave some feedback from our experience with Stoke Mandivile NICU. I have had two daughters born at 32 weeks and both stayed here in the care of these amazing nurses!  \r\nAs soon as my daughters were born we were made to feel so cared for, not just the babies but us as parents too. The nurses took the time to come over and over sit with us to make sure we were ok emotionally and that we understood exactly what we could expect and what was happening with our daughters. Every time we came in the nurse who was caring for our daughter came over to update us and it really felt like a second family and I cannot thank them enough. I actually felt sad that I wouldn’t be seeing these lovely ladies each day when we were discharged.  \r\nThe NICU was immaculate and well kept. Especially with having my second daughter during Covid, they made us feel confident that every measure to keep all safe was put in place. The staff went out of their way to make all parents feel welcome from ensuring we were comfortable with getting our daughter out the incubator to the make tags placed on them that made it that little bit more caring.  \r\nThe one difference from my first daughter being born in 2018 to now is the online portal to receive updates, photos and videos. Both my husband and I felt this made a big difference to the metal well-being of mothers and reasurment that they were being well cared for. We were always told to call at any point and when we did we were always speaking to a friendly happy welcoming staff member. It was lovely that some staff remembered us from our first daughter.  \r\nI wanted to mention three staff members in particular who we felt really needed acknowledgement for their outstanding care.  \r\nFirstly the lovley Norma, (Hopfully I have spelt that correctly). Norma was so supportive and caring, every time I spoke with her she was full of reassuremeant and you could really tell she loved her job and cared so much for all the babies in her care. I needed support during the emotional journey of expressing milk and I couldn’t have done it without her help. I felt as if I could speak to her about anything.  \r\nSecondly I wanted to mention Ange. Ange really became someone who I really trusted. She cared for both my daughter during their time in the NICU and I felt she really listened to us and did everything possible to help our daughter meet the targets to be discharged. I felt she would really fight for our daughter to ensure they had everything they needed from other staff and doctors.  \r\nThirdly is Ikrah who is an amazing person. She has such a positive attitude and helped me personally during some very emotional moments towards the end. The way she was with my daughter Ella was fantastic and showed so much love towards her. I would have loved to stay in contact with her after discharge as she bought so much positivity during that time.  \r\nI really hope this feedback is passed on to the staff and they receive the well deserved Recognition for all their hard work. All the ladies were fantastic & turned a very emotional time in our lives into positives which is something we will never forget.  \r\n  \r\n","criticality":"not

7am and were met by two of the most wonderful midwifes you could ask for, Joan & Elidth, from start to finish they were super, they helped ease my worry they chatted away to my partner made him just as big a part of the day as me, was so lovely, when we got to theatre they were still superstars chatting and laughing away  \r\nThen all the theatre staff were amazing, introduced themselves we had a great chat about our kids and dogs really helped ease my worries, they took pictures for us of our little love being born, kept my partner in the know as I lost a lot of blood but they never told me they kept me distracted with my new bundle asking whats her name who she looks more like etc, all while dealing with a big blood loss, very calm it all was my partner knew what was going on but I was none the wiser.  \r\nThe after care from Joan & Elidth was 10 out of 10, they really made sure I was feeling good, offered teas coffees toast to both myself and partner, really helpful with showering, No question was too silly for them they were super supportive and great knowledge and what ever elidth didn't know she would find out, even on out realise day it was Joan & Elidth who done it all and said goodbye and really helped put our minds to ease with coming home with a tiny new human, They were just fantastic and the hospital is so lucky to have them.","criticality":"not

I felt a little light headed as soon as I was up but then I started to stagger and bounce off the walls in the hallway and then collapsed on the floor.  \r\nI crawled to the bathroom but was unable to stand and was also sweating profusely all over my body. I managed to stand and thought I have to get to the lounge quickly to lie down on the sofa but I was still on the verge of vomiting and collapsing but got there slowly but it felt like an age.  \r\nI couldn’t shout for help but had to use my iPad to call my wife upstairs. She came down and supported me and try and figure out what was going on...stroke, heart attack? It felt like something serious was going to happen. I managed to get to sleep and felt better when I awoke but still dizzy and lightheaded when I awoke.  \r\nI went to use the toilet and compared to last night I got there ok but when I opened my bowels I noticed that my stool was black and I knew I had to get this checked so I called 111 and was advised to go to A&E.  \r\nIt was a long wait but I got to see a Doctor and explained what had happened but couldn’t figure what was wrong but was happy that I felt normal again and was going to send me home when I remembered to mention about the “black stool” I passed and he did an internal exam straight away and told me that I was bleeding internally and admitted me for tests.  \r\nI had bloods and observations taken and also an endoscopy which found an ulcer that was bleeding. This was fixed and I felt great after the treatment as the pain I had put up with for 3-4 years had gone and I just need to take some medication for a while to protect the stomach lining.  \r\nWhilst I was in the hospital which looked very clean due to the constant hard work of the domestic staff and carers, the treatment I received from the nurses who were spread thin from start to finish was amazing and it really made me proud of the NHS and Team St Mary’s Isle of Wight.  \r\nI am a senior in a care home on the island and what you do and how you care for people is important to me and what I saw and heard personally and from other patients experiences was good compared to Southampton and QA.  \r\nIt could have gone very bad for myself if undiagnosed and also for the importance of mentioning all the little details for the Doctor to make a correct diagnosis which can potentially save someone’s life.  \r\nA massive thank you from me to you all at St Mary’s Isle of Wight especially AAU and SSU.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-08-03T07:44:58.52","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2021-08-05T12:52:13.103","readBy":[{"name":"Healthwatch Isle of Wight","count":1},{"name":"Healthwatch Portsmouth","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/867848","id":"867848"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/867848/responses","id":"867848"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/867848/healthservices","id":"867848"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/867848/tags","id":"867848"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rhu02_301","id":"RHU02_301","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/a&e","id":"a&e"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/aau","id":"aau"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bleeding","id":"bleeding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bowels","id":"bowels"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/carers","id":"Carers"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctors","id":"doctors"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/domestic%20staff","id":"domestic staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gastroenterology","id":"gastroenterology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good","id":"good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stomach%20ulcer","id":"stomach ulcer"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vomiting","id":"vomiting"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ward%20tvs","id":"Ward tvs"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing","id":"amazing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happy","id":"happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/proud%20of%20the%20nhs","id":"proud of the nhs"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/proud%20of%20nhs","id":"proud of nhs"}]},{"id":867891,"author":"JammyDodger82","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"I can hear again","body":"I have been struggling with my ears for over a week, been to my GP, started on treatment and a week down the line - still bad.  \r\nI attended the ENT ward at Victoria Hospital today, I was greeted by the Senior Charge Nurse who was very friendly and helpful.

Thank you so much to Nola and the amazing team at QMH, 10/10 service and care.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-08-03T14:00:39.47","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-08-05T13:28:06.99","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Fife","count":6}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/867921","id":"867921"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/867921/responses","id":"867921"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/867921/healthservices","id":"867921"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/867921/tags","id":"867921"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/f805h_daysurgery","id":"F805H_daysurgery","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nervous","id":"nervous"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anaesthetic","id":"Anaesthetic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/day%20surgery","id":"day surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/safe","id":"safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/skilled%20staff","id":"skilled staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/time%20for%20patients","id":"time for patients"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/well%20looked%20after","id":"well looked after"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing","id":"amazing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassion","id":"compassion"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fantastic","id":"fantastic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20ease","id":"at ease"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/868576","id":"868576"}]},{"id":867971,"author":"Charlotte1705","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"A+E visit","body":"I went to A+E and saw a Doctor called Mike.

That went all well until 4 weeks later I was bleeding very heavily as losing tissue as well on the sun and it got worse.  \r\nI rang 111 and they advised me to come into hospital as soon as possible as soon as I got in my car to come to hospital I was bleeding so bad it went through my trousers my underwear and a towel sat on, I waited for 2 hours in a& e to be seen. I asked the lady who is doing my bloods to see where I can get a pad or get changed or something to feel more comfortable as I could not sit in that any more.  \r\nThe doctor called me then asked me questions, I was talking to him them he walked off and did not come back at all, I did not even know what was happening. I got to the ward at 23. 30 that night I was uncomfortable I feel like I needed a shower, I stayed in that night. The doctor wanted me to have a scan the next day but no one turned up to that me. I was so upset and annoyed I just wanted to go home and then I have to come bk the next day to have my scan done.  \r\nSo had my scan done and the doctor said the next best thing is surgery to remove the remaining tissue. Which was booked for Thursday. So I had to not eat or drink anything the night before and had to be there by 8 in the morning I waited all day to have my surgery done and the doctor who put the canular in my arm is was so painful and my hand was so cold, he did it twice in the same arm in two different places.  \r\nSo it was my turn to have it do after waiting for ages, got down there and they I was turned away because for a emergency so that made me feel worse and so upset and just cried then because I wanted it over and to be done with after waiting all day as it was. They finally told me at in 11 last night that I will have to wait until the next day to have it done so I had to stay in again and after that I had it done at 11 40 in the morning after I had it done I was home that day because I was just had enough","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-08-03T15:02:46.45","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-08-05T13:44:05.047","readBy":[{"name":"United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust","count":6}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/867932","id":"867932"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/867932/responses","id":"867932"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/867932/healthservices","id":"867932"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/867932/tags","id":"867932"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rwdla_180","id":"RWDLA_180","score":3},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/annoyed","id":"annoyed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20upset","id":"very upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/arm","id":"arm"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bleed","id":"bleed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bleeding","id":"bleeding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cancelled%20appointments","id":"cancelled appointments"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/day%20surgery","id":"day surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency","id":"emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hand","id":"hand"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kept%20informed","id":"kept informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scan","id":"scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/some%20staff","id":"some staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/termination","id":"termination"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/uncomfortable","id":"uncomfortable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/explanations","id":"explanations"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cannula%20insertion","id":"cannula insertion"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20home","id":"at home"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/869824","id":"869824"}]},{"id":867950,"author":"lacertajk46","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Excellent maternity care in Oban","body":"Thank you to all the staff at the maternity unit in Oban.

The health visitor was covering for the one we should have had. We then had a scheduled phone call with her due to pandemic rules which was cancelled when she to also went off sick and this was not rearranged. I had a list of questions we needed answered and after chasing HV's in our area and phoning several numbers we were meant to see someone in the surgery when getting one set of her jags. The message was not passed on so a brief discussion was had in the corridor in passing instead. With questions still unanswered and more of me making phone calls I finally reached a health visitor but again phone call felt rushed and like the health visitor was not interested as she had too much to do. I was promised I would be given appointment soon.  \r\nFollowing this my partner and I continued to work through things on our own, questions going unanswered. Appointments would be made for the future and then cancelled last minute by health visitors time and time again. Covid was used as an excuse but it seemed clear the staffing shortages was the problem as when on the phone staff were rude and unhappy about having to cover my area due to staff absences/shortages.  \r\nWe finally got a 7 month visit by a bank staff member who helped with questions I had at that moment in time, and after speaking to her about how I have felt about the service/lack of she advised I make a complaint. I have held off on doing so to until now hoping it would improve but after still not having been contacted by anyone again when you should receive an 8 month visit and having a list of unanswered questions which I don't want to waste GP time on I finally want to raise these issues. I no longer feel comfortable phoning the various numbers I was given as it's a gamble as to who will answer and whether they will be willing to help.  \r\nSpeaking to other mums of babies similar age both in Forth Valley and other Scottish regions they are receiving all appointments and have regular contact and support with their Health Visitors.  \r\nIn the past I believe there was walk in clinics which maybe this area (Banknock/Bonnybridge) should be considering if their lack of staff and time is meaning families are being let down around care and support.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-08-03T11:04:53.0633333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-08-05T14:06:17.303","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Forth Valley","count":3}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/867880","id":"867880"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/867880/responses","id":"867880"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/867880/healthservices","id":"867880"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/867880/tags","id":"867880"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sv9-health-visiting","id":"sv9-health-visiting","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/neglected","id":"neglected"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/answering%20questions","id":"answering questions"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cancelled%20appointments","id":"cancelled appointments"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/health%20visitor","id":"health visitor"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/postnatal","id":"postnatal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/rushed","id":"rushed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unhappy","id":"unhappy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unsure","id":"unsure"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/time%20given","id":"Time given"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pandemic","id":"pandemic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid","id":"covid"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/868586","id":"868586"}]},{"id":867979,"author":"mineralbd44","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"The Maternity ward is very calm","body":"My time in the Maternity ward at Daisy Hill Hospital has been quite good.

Previously I have given birth at the maternity in another hospital, and compared the two Daisy Hill is a much calmer environment.  \r\nMany thanks again to all the midwives for looking after me so very well!","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-08-03T16:54:40.2933333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-08-05T14:07:00.26","readBy":[{"name":"Southern Health and Social Care Trust","count":5}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/867979","id":"867979"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/867979/responses","id":"867979"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/867979/healthservices","id":"867979"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/867979/tags","id":"867979"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_33020_501","id":"ZT003_33020_501","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/birth","id":"birth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/c-section","id":"c-section"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctors","id":"doctors"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good","id":"good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/midwives","id":"midwives"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ward","id":"ward"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/calm","id":"calm"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thankful","id":"Thankful"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/869944","id":"869944"}]},{"id":867985,"author":"requirementqy58","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Good time in maternity but very warm","body":"My time in Maternity at Daisy Hill Hospital has been very good.

I have Aspergers so I have found life extremely difficult and confusing.

I am also menopausal which has really affected my body and mind badly. What makes things more difficult for me is that I look really well and healthy. I've become an expert at pretending that I'm fine! &nbsp; I wrote this, not to complain because I think Girvan is a great place to stay but to bring to the attention of the doctors that I am unable to make contact via email.

In November 2019, I had to come in via ambulance with serious kidney infection. All staff I encountered were fantastic. The following morning I developed sepsis. I don't remember massive amounts of information, but the doctors and nurses on A9 were fantastic and I spent a few days in Critial Care. Special mention to nurse Elaine, wonderful lady, who looked after me and kept me sane and calm!  \r\nA year on, the same thing happened. Got brought up by ambulance, treated like I was a time waster. I kept begging for help to go to the toilet and even my bell was ignored. Yes there is/was the Covid crisis, I waited hours to have any pain relief. Was finally put on A9. Due to the same issue flaring up again, was told nephrostomy was the only option. I really out up resistance to this, as I detested it last time and still do! Was told I would have exploratory surgery, to see if scar tissue could be removed to insert stent instead. So I begrudgingly agreed to nephrostomy, on the understanding that I might be able to ditch the nephrostomy in January.  \r\nWhen January came, got called to the clinic, my surgeries have all been out on hold for 12 to 18 months. I have now also waited for right kidney removal for over two years. And apart from tube changes, I have had no appointments, apart from to untighten a tube that had been screwed in too tightly from tube change, I have heard nothing! ! I have had nothing but constant infections and pain since having the nephrostomy, I've lost my job, I have had to self refer to Healthy Minds, from the impact on my mental health, I feel like I have been forgotten about.  \r\nI know unless I get kidney failure of sepsis again, that it is unlikely I will be remembered, seen or treated. Fair enough patients with cancer and more serious issues need to take presidence, but apart from 3 monthly tube changes, nothing is done.  \r\nWhen you are lucky enough to see anyone from urology/nephrology, they are really good, over worked and wonderful staff. The staff who look after you in RI for tube changes are also very good. But for the record, the tube changes do hurt, no gas and air doesn't cut it, I do find every tube change traumatic and yes I do want sedation please!  \r\nI know I'm not the only one waiting. I know other departments across the board are struggling too. But we are people not just hospital numbers and statistics. How do I feel? I hope I've made this clear. Will writing this make an iota of difference? Probably not.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-08-04T10:43:15.26","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-08-05T14:58:21.93","readBy":[{"name":"The Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/868193","id":"868193"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/868193/responses","id":"868193"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/868193/healthservices","id":"868193"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/868193/tags","id":"868193"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rl403_180","id":"RL403_180","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rl403_361","id":"RL403_361","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rya-emergency","id":"RYA-emergency","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/access%20to%20pain%20relief","id":"access to pain relief"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/critical%20care%20staff","id":"Critical care staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kidney%20infection","id":"kidney infection"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wait%20times","id":"wait times"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ambulance%20staff","id":"ambulance staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ignored%20buzzer","id":"ignored buzzer"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/869847","id":"869847"}]},{"id":868227,"author":"avocetrq69","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Nurses were helpful and friendly","body":"Amanda, Laura and Kayleigh  \r\nThe nurses were very helpful and friendly :)  \r\nMade me feel at ease at my appointment","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-08-04T11:38:22.2433333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-08-05T14:58:52.063","readBy":[{"name":"Midlands Partnership NHS Foundation Trust","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/868227","id":"868227"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/868227/responses","id":"868227"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/868227/healthservices","id":"868227"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/868227/tags","id":"868227"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rrex4-sexual-health-services-shropshire","id":"rrex4-sexual-health-services-shropshire","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helpful","id":"helpful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20ease","id":"at ease"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/869437","id":"869437"}]},{"id":868228,"author":"slideff89","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Made me feel safe and happy","body":"Amanda, Laura and Kayleigh  \r\nAll lovely ladies that made me feel safe and happy.

Raigmore was under Code Black and it was a mini heatwave so not the best time to be bedridden in a hospital! Despite this and clearly stretched staffing my care was excellent. From the auxiliary who showed me such kindness when I was crying over missing my son to the Staff Nurse in charge of the Ward who was sympathetic and patient when I was terrified of the injections despite having a million other things to do! The physio who gently encouraged me to get out of bed and all the other unsung heroes of the Ward. I cant thank them enough.  \r\nIt was absolutely hectic. I've never seen such busy individuals. Literally non stop from patient to patient.  \r\nMy only complaint. The awful food. As a coeliac it was beyond disgraceful. The poor folk doing the food orders on the tablet had to go through a so called allergy free menu every day that was chock full of allergies! There was next to no gluten free options and I did struggle to find food to eat. With covid I had no visitors and no way to get access to healthy safe options. This was my only complaint and nothing to do with the staff on the Ward. Purely a catering issue.  \r\nSo huge thanks to all in the Ward. You are absolute heroes.","criticality":"minimally critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-08-04T12:09:31.1933333","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2021-08-05T15:12:37.05","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Highland","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/868235","id":"868235"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/868235/responses","id":"868235"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/868235/healthservices","id":"868235"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/868235/tags","id":"868235"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/h202h_110","id":"H202H_110","score":4},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/above%20and%20beyond","id":"above and beyond"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/allergy","id":"allergy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/car%20accident","id":"car accident"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/coeliac","id":"coeliac"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dietary%20requirements","id":"dietary requirements"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/encouraged","id":"encouraged"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/encouragement","id":"encouragement"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/excellent%20staff","id":"excellent staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/food","id":"food"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/food%20choice","id":"food choice"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gluten","id":"gluten"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kindness","id":"kindness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/orthopaedic","id":"orthopaedic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/safe","id":"safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sympathy","id":"sympathy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/patience","id":"patience"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"}]}]
