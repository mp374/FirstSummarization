[{"id":819272,"author":"Patzn98","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Endoscopy","body":"I was booked at Mt Stuart hospital Torbay for an endoscopy today. The staff were wonderful, caring and helpful. We agreed that I would have sedation. Some where between that discussion & getting to the procedure room, my doctor had changed their mind and went ahead with the procedure without sedating me.  \r\nIt was an extremely traumatic experience. My oesophagus is raw and swollen (which is why I was having the procedure) and they pushed the tube down my throat and twisted and manoeuvred it around. & into my stomach. I was gagging and was in such pain and shock that I find it hard to put into words. It took several painful and traumatic minutes, my eyes were watering, my mouth was running with saliva from the constant gag reflex...it truly was awful.  \r\nWhat allowed me to get through it was the wonderful nursing staff, who held my hand and tried to keep me calm throughout this ordeal.  \r\nIn my opinion this is not a procedure anyone should go through without some form of sedation. My doctor was a lovely person who spent time discussing my health and reassuring me and the nursing staff were tremendous but I’m baffled as to why I was put through it without our agreed sedation. To be honest it will take me some time to recover from this experience.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-01-26T23:08:53.9666667","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2021-02-01T09:20:02.233","readBy":[],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/819272","id":"819272"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/819272/responses","id":"819272"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/819272/healthservices","id":"819272"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/819272/tags","id":"819272"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/1-128732982","id":"1-128732982","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/traumatic","id":"traumatic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/access%20to%20pain%20relief","id":"access to pain relief"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctor","id":"doctor"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/endoscopy","id":"Endoscopy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kept%20informed","id":"kept informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lovely","id":"lovely"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/oesophagus","id":"oesophagus"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reflex","id":"reflex"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sedation","id":"sedation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/throat","id":"throat"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/understanding","id":"understanding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/calm","id":"calm"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20for","id":"cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassuring","id":"reassuring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported","id":"supported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wonderful%20staff","id":"wonderful staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/baffled","id":"baffled"}]},{"id":819515,"author":"John23","authorRoleId":2,"authorRole":"a friend","title":"Patient pass away","body":"Devastated from start to finish.

I felt as if it must have been something I had done wrong as I was a mum and didn't feel I could share it with anyone as I would be judged. For a long time I just hoped he would find a way and \"grow out of it\" as he wasn't open to discussion or help and got progressively more aggressive at home. This caused my younger child to be fearful of what may happen next and I explained that if he didn't live by the simple house rules of keeping us all safe from his chosen habits then he would need to leave. He chose to leave and continued to use drugs and alcohol to mask his feelings and deal with his deteriorating mental health.  \r\nIt was heart breaking to see my beautiful boy ravaged by harder drugs and a regular habit became a daily need and addiction had taken control of him. It led to attempts at suicide, which thankfully weren't successful and periods of homelessness. This further entrenched his feeling of worthlessness and it was a vicious cycle of using drugs to mask his deep depression. When he one day reached out and told me the truth of his addiction, he was brave enough to search out help with Inclusion and I heard about PSL and the support groups they offered to family and friends of anyone addicted to any substance.  \r\nAt last I had somewhere safe I could speak openly about the type of drugs he was on, share the feelings of shame, guilt and powerlessness to \"make it better for him\"  \r\nThe group and the amazing therapists at PSL have, through 1 to 1 counselling, wellness sessions and group discussion helped me through the hardest times without judgement and at any time of the day or night.  \r\nToday 9 years on and my son still has an addiction but he has a home, engages with Inclusion and is much more able to talk about his feelings. I still value the support PSL give me as I don't know how I would continue to help him stay on the \"straight and narrow\" and constantly be his support in budgeting, keeping healthy, eating well and offering a stable family to call when he needs to talk or visit to remind him he is loved and valued. We still have blips and the responsibility feels overbearing sometimes but PSL have helped me learn to cope in difficult situations and be able to step away and keep myself safe when I need to.  \r\nWithout PSL I may have given up on him for the sake of my own sanity but with support you can find the strength to encourage your loved one without compromising your own safety and wellbeing.

While I was being prepared for surgery I doctors noticed I I had lost movement in my left side. and my speech was very poor. I believe I was then rushed to the CT scanner where they found a clot on my brain. I was rushed to theatre where a procedure called a thrombectomy was performed. The nursing staff in the stroke unit have told me, this is a new procedure and I am one of the first in Tayside to receive this treatment. I was in theatre for 2 hours where the clot was completely removed and I am back to my normal self. I am now fit enough to undergo my surgery now. This is due completely to the wonderful care I have received consistently from the amazing drs and nurses especially the stroke team. So therefore I thank everyone for saving my life.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-01-29T09:27:30.2366667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-02-01T11:01:26.723","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Tayside","count":19}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/819545","id":"819545"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/819545/responses","id":"819545"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/819545/healthservices","id":"819545"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/819545/tags","id":"819545"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/t101h_100","id":"T101H_100","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/t101h_110","id":"T101H_110","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/t101h-stroke","id":"t101h-stroke","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/all%20staff","id":"all staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/end%20of%20life","id":"end of life"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fast%20response","id":"Fast response"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/get%20fit","id":"get fit"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/normal","id":"normal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nursing%20care","id":"nursing care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/orthopaedics","id":"orthopaedics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/recovery","id":"recovery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/rushed","id":"rushed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/speech","id":"speech"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stroke","id":"stroke"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgical%20team","id":"surgical team"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing","id":"amazing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/820039","id":"820039"}]},{"id":819556,"author":"poppies59","authorRoleId":4,"authorRole":"a relative","title":"Services not keeping promises","body":"I'm supporting a relative who has health conditions and she also has 3 autistic children.

She attended RAH early hours the next day. She had 2 x-rays but staff unable to say broken or not. They tried to get her to walk but she could not weight bear, nurse tried to bandage her knee when it was her ankle which had suspected break.  \r\nHer mum was told consultant would look at it and call and she was sent home with a boot on. Someone called the following day and said it looked broken and she would need a scan. The hospital were contacted daily to ask when and her mum was told could not say as all scanners were being used for covid patients. Then told consultant would speak to her on his ward round, they were told she was not on a ward but was at home.  \r\nEventually got call from RHC Glasgow to attend for scan a week later same day got call from RAH to come for scan but took the RHC appointment. Was scanned and her ankle is broken with a piece of bone broken off also. Was told report had to go to RAH. Called RAH to ask what was happening and told it was being referred back to RHC.  \r\nLater on was called by RAH to say sorry for all this bother and that as she had now left the ward they would close case. Her mum had to tell them once again she had never been in a ward and found what they were saying strange as RAH does not have a children's ward anymore. It is now 10 days that my granddaughter has been left in pain and unable to weight bear with a broken ankle. This is totally unacceptable. Could someone please just attend to her broken ankle.  \r\nI am totally disgusted at the treatment from the RAH and if my granddaughters ankle has fused in wrong place and she needs an operation please be assured I will be suing.","criticality":"strongly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-01-09T11:19:44.16","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-02-01T11:20:02.037","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":15},{"name":"St. Andrews University ScotGEM Medical Students","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/815283","id":"815283"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/815283/responses","id":"815283"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/815283/healthservices","id":"815283"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/815283/tags","id":"815283"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/c418h_180","id":"C418H_180","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/c418h_420","id":"C418H_420","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/c418h-radiology","id":"C418H-radiology","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ankle","id":"ankle"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bone","id":"bone"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/break","id":"break"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/broken","id":"broken"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/broken%20ankle","id":"broken ankle"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/knee","id":"knee"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/leg","id":"leg"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/operation","id":"operation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scan","id":"scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/terrible","id":"terrible"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/walk","id":"walk"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/weight","id":"weight"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/x-rays","id":"x-rays"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting%20time%20for%20appointment","id":"waiting time for appointment"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/819726","id":"819726"}]},{"id":819564,"author":"Robert123","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Recent surgery","body":"I was admitted to Causeway Hospital on New Years Eve suffering from gallbladder problems  \r\nThe condition was diagnosed as Mirizzi Syndrome .

Was asked at reception to fill in a form, regarding aspects of my health, medications I was on. Went to toilet, as I felt the need to urinate. A kind nurse came and took me round to a curtained cubicle, asked me to undress and to provide a urine sample. After drinking over 2 Litres of water, I was happy to oblige! Same nurse took blood samples and administered intravenous anti-biotics. The surgeon, who was going to carry out the procedure, came around; introduced himself and informed me of what he was going to do. Nice to be kept in the picture.. a staff member came along and took me into the operating theatre. He explained what was going to happen and that he would keep me informed throughout the procedure of what would be happening next.I was introduced to the theatre team and was rewarded with many smiles. All, very reassuring. . the same staff member was there, all the way through and communicated very effectively. Totally painless biopsy and was then wheeled back into my \"changing room\", had a cup of tea and biscuits, plus another invite to urinate. Managed the tea and pee, left a happy chappie to go home with my wife. GREAT WORK by a top team. Just a couple of observations. Letting me know that I had to provide urine samples beforehand would've been nice. Fro check in to check out was around 2.5 hours. My wife could have gone shopping if she had known this.

I was given great support in hospital by both midwifes and auxiliary staff and I felt semi confident when I was discharged after a one night stay in the postnatal ward. By the time my baby was 3 days old I was struggling with lots of pain whilst breastfeeding and needed support. When my community Midwife visited me she said my pain was due to damage but I should contact breastfeeding support for a visit. I immediately called the local breastfeeding team and spoke with someone who informed me due to pandemic they were not allowed to visit me in my home and I should speak to my Midwife. I felt so deflated and unsupported. My Midwife had already been and didn't offer great help apart from telling me to call the breastfeeding support team. I felt like no one would come near me to help and I was in agony. I managed to feed my baby for one more day but then stopped as I was so so sore and just didn't know who else to turn to. It really affected me and I believe it contributed to my very poor mental health in the months that followed. If someone had just taken me under their wing and offered to help who knows I might still be breastfeeding now but it hasn't turned out like that. I felt very let down but these services and all due to a pandemic which I felt made them scared and no one knew what was happening and what services were allowed and which were not.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-01-29T18:45:13.51","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-02-01T13:41:00.697","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Fife","count":6},{"name":"NHS Education for Scotland","count":1},{"name":"Scottish Recovery Network","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/819616","id":"819616"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/819616/responses","id":"819616"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/819616/healthservices","id":"819616"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/819616/tags","id":"819616"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/f704h-maternity-cm","id":"f704h-maternity-cm","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/f704h-maternity-mw","id":"f704h-maternity-Mw","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sf9-breast-feeding","id":"sf9-breast-feeding","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helpless","id":"helpless"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scared","id":"scared"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/being%20listened%20to","id":"Being listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breastfeeding","id":"breastfeeding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hospital%20care","id":"hospital care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/postnatal","id":"postnatal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unsupported","id":"unsupported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pandemic","id":"pandemic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/impact%20of%20covid-19","id":"impact of covid-19"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/postnatal%20ward","id":"postnatal ward"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/819770","id":"819770"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/819777","id":"819777"}]},{"id":819617,"author":"DIT DIT","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Dedication at a difficult time","body":"Yet again, NHS wins a Blue Peter Badge !!

I had a very severe acute pain in my mid to lower back. I waited 45 minutes for my call to be answered which I did not mind as I understood the pressure the service was under due to the pandemic.  \r\nWhen my call was answered by a call handler they were pleasant and asked me a series of questions before seeking advice from a Nurse practitioner on duty. Unfortunately that is where the good service ends as I felt the nurse did not appreciate the severity of my case, I am a young healthy women who should not have been in pain like I was. I was told to take over the counter pain relief and call back if anything changed. I was writhing around in pain but was not listened to.  \r\nI myself am a Health professional and felt disappointed at the care I was given. I held out and called my GP Monday and was sent for an urgent scan and it discovered a serious kidney condition which could have been discovered earlier if the Nurse at NHS24 had been a little more understanding. I felt due to the fact I wasn't calling with covid issues I was not a priority and this is not what our NHS stands for. I am now receiving very good timely care from the local urology team and I cannot fault the care I have been given by my GP and local acute hospital.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-01-29T18:21:43.08","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-02-01T14:29:35.253","readBy":[{"name":"NHS 24","count":30},{"name":"Fife Health & Social Care Partnership","count":3}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/819615","id":"819615"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/819615/responses","id":"819615"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/819615/healthservices","id":"819615"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/819615/tags","id":"819615"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/nhs24-111","id":"NHS24-111","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disappointed","id":"disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20being%20listened%20to","id":"not being listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20listened%20to","id":"not listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/assessment","id":"assessment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/call%20handler","id":"call handler"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kidney","id":"kidney"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/my%20gp","id":"My GP"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20good","id":"not good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scan","id":"scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/urology","id":"urology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/urology%20team","id":"urology team"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20disappointed","id":"very disappointed"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/819768","id":"819768"}]},{"id":819634,"author":"Grexx95","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Knee replacement","body":"I was sent home yesterday and cannot praise the hospital staff enough from the very beginning I was treated with great care&nbsp; and made to feel at ease.

Their tales could be summarised as barely organised chaos. They agreed that they were concerned that they were at risk of infection, with large numbers of people milling around, little attempt at social distancing and stewards not really knowing what to do. I really did not want to throw away what was nearly a year of isolation.  \r\nI found out I had no need to worry. I attended the vaccination facility at Babbington Hospital in Belper, and was extremely impressed. An army of stewards were wonderful. Those outside must have been freezing and all must have been exhausted as it was after 5pm, nearly the end of a long hard day. Every one of them was cheerful - and not a forced cheerfulness of 'we've been told to be nice to people', but a genuine warmth. Every one of them interacted with me as I worked my way to the vaccination area. Virtually all of us seemed to be in the 75+ age group like myself, and there was no hint of patronising, sadly so common when encountering people in their position. No 'Come along deary' but lots of 'Hi, how are you doing, are you OK?'.  \r\nThere was a chain of people on hand to give information from the car park entrance to the injection area. Passing one of them, there was always another in sight. At no time was I left wondering where to go next.  \r\nThis is a mammoth undertaking, organised at relatively short notice, and needing a lot of people to make it work. I just wish I could thank everyone who was there personally. They were brilliant.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-01-30T09:53:15.1366667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-02-01T16:25:26.183","readBy":[{"name":"Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/819633","id":"819633"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/819633/responses","id":"819633"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/819633/healthservices","id":"819633"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/819633/tags","id":"819633"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/ry8de","id":"RY8DE","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/apprehensive","id":"apprehensive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/impressed","id":"impressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%20vaccine","id":"covid vaccine"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/820018","id":"820018"}]},{"id":819637,"author":"deno","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Mixed review of my inpatient stay","body":"Vernon ward St James  \r\nFrom my recent experience I feel this ward was one of the worst for cleanliness and support from staff.  \r\nAfter spending 2 days in ICU I was brought up to Vernon Ward. On arrival no staff actually came to see how I was, I felt they were too worried about getting the people who were being discharged, discharged.  \r\nI was still sleeping in my bed with blood all over it 2 days in.  \r\nI was told my wound will need dressing and changing by my surgeon, day 2 every staff member I asked had something to say, ill ask the nurse in charge, I don't have any time ill pass this onto the next shift.  \r\nOn day 3 I noticed my stoma bag was leaking so asked them to give me something to clean the wound and some dressing. Someone did come and give it to me but didn't offer to clean or change it for me. Considering I just had surgery and a huge cut in my abdomen, was difficult to bend or see what I was doing. Managed to clean it and put a new dressing on it myself. I found the whole experience on this ward very much disappointing and distressing.  \r\nOn asking one nurse if I could have alternative pain relief that my Consultant had recommended, the nurse just walked away. the nurse came back and informed me their computer wasn't working...why didn't they just tell me that, then the same nurse just came over and gave me a cup of medication, didn't even tell me what it was until I called them back to ask.  \r\nI just felt staff on this ward just seem too busy for the patients and their patient focused care has somewhat been compromised!  \r\nI understand that on some of these days they may have been short staffed and over run by new admissions but I found that from my experience some of the HCA seemed reluctant to carry out some of the duties.  \r\nHowever there were the odd few that actually did want to assist and help, which was nice when you came across them. 2 staff members were truly amazing. It was easy to approach the and when asking them questions one of these staff members took the time to talk and explain things, unlike some of the other professionals on the ward. Another staff member also took patient care into consideration, a very old lady opposite me was crying and before I could press my buzzer they noticed and came over to her.  \r\nAlso, I had emptied my urine in bowl and took it to the nurses station, one of the nurses who was really busy asked a HSA to take it from me and they refused. The nurse said OK let me get my gloves and ill take it which they did. The nurse was busy writing up notes on the days events and actually the HCA was just walking around.  \r\nI was quite cold one night so I asked a senior staff member if they could get me an extra blanket and maybe turn the heating on. They said they have no control over the heating and its maintenance that do it. So this whole time there was no heating on, on this floor. And I didn't get a blanket! Also this same nurse, woke me up at 6am to ask if I wanted pain relief, when I said yes, I was told I need to eat first! Then why wake me up at 6am?  \r\nI stayed on Grey Ward some years back and the situation was the same. I would have thought it would've changed by now.  \r\nI really wouldn't want any of my relatives to stay on Vernon Ward.  \r\nCredit to some of the staff were all really helpful and supportive.  \r\nIntensive Care Unit, what a difference. The nurse who was looking after me really attended to me and gave me so much support when it was needed, not to say I didn't need as much support when I was moved to the ward.  \r\nThey are very attentive to your recovery in ICU and really tried to prepare me as much as they could to go onto the ward .","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-01-30T11:50:09.6066667","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2021-02-01T16:40:39.34","readBy":[{"name":"St. Andrews University ScotGEM Medical Students","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/819637","id":"819637"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/819637/responses","id":"819637"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/819637/healthservices","id":"819637"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/819637/tags","id":"819637"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rj701_100","id":"RJ701_100","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rj701_301","id":"RJ701_301","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/distressing","id":"distressing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/worried","id":"worried"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/abdomen","id":"abdomen"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood","id":"blood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cleanliness","id":"cleanliness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dressing","id":"dressing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/intensive%20care","id":"intensive care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/intensive%20care%20unit","id":"intensive care unit"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/more%20staff","id":"more staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain%20relief","id":"pain relief"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/run","id":"run"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/some%20staff","id":"some staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attitude","id":"staff attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stoma","id":"stoma"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/the%20change","id":"the change"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/walking","id":"walking"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wound","id":"wound"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"}]},{"id":819644,"author":"Vaccinee","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Covid vaccination","body":"Extremely friendly staff, putting my nerves at ease.

The explanations were clear and not rushed, and I was then escorted to the main waiting area to sit for 5 minutes to ensure all was well.  \r\nI estimate there must have been about 20 staff (both clinical and assistants) circulating in a reasonably confined area, and yet their routine worked without a hitch.  \r\nPlease pass on my thanks and congratulations to all at Heatherview for their outstanding efforts to make getting the vaccine and calm and swift experience.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-01-29T12:53:29.49","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-02-01T18:20:00.463","readBy":[{"name":"Heatherview Medical Centre","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/819569","id":"819569"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/819569/responses","id":"819569"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/819569/healthservices","id":"819569"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/819569/tags","id":"819569"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/j81044","id":"J81044","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/assistant","id":"Assistant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/clinical%20staff","id":"Clinical staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/organisation","id":"organisation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/parking","id":"parking"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/rushed","id":"rushed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/temperature","id":"temperature"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/calm","id":"calm"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good%20experience","id":"good experience"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/826413","id":"826413"}]},{"id":819638,"author":"Another frustrated","authorRoleId":4,"authorRole":"a relative","title":"Access to vaccinations for a housebound 95 year old","body":"I have now being trying to access a CV19 vaccination to my housebound father who lives north of Newark.

I had a ‘balloon pump’ fitted by an outstanding team and after some critical days in the care of the utterly wonderful staff in CCU (especially nurse Catriona and her colleagues), I was moved to Ward 9. Because of complications, I spent a further 5 weeks there before having an ICD fitted by Dr Glen and Consultant Dr O’Rourke. In Ward 9, notwithstanding the height of the pandemic, the exemplary nature of care and professionalism continued from Consultant Dr MacDougall and Dr Pitcaithly to nurses (especially Lucy and Sam) and support staff.  \r\nI recently returned to the Cardiology Dept for the first time since my discharge for a routine scan. Somewhat to my surprise, I found myself very moved by this visit. Once again the professionalism and personal care was outstanding (thank you Joanne!). It would have been wonderful to meet again (and thank) some of the staff face to face but that was not possible. I owe them a debt of gratitude I will never be able to repay. At the time I did try to write a personal note of thanks to everyone who contributed to my treatment and recovery, inevitably I will have missed someone out. I hope this note goes some way to help make up for that.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-01-31T15:06:53.1666667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-02-02T11:09:16.267","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lanarkshire","count":8},{"name":"North Lanarkshire Health & Social Care Partnership","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/819680","id":"819680"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/819680/responses","id":"819680"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/819680/healthservices","id":"819680"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/819680/tags","id":"819680"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l302h_320","id":"L302H_320","score":5},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l302h-ccu","id":"l302h-ccu","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/all%20staff","id":"all staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cardiac%20arrest","id":"cardiac arrest"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cardiology","id":"cardiology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/personal%20care","id":"personal care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professionalism","id":"professionalism"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gratitude","id":"gratitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wonderful%20staff","id":"wonderful staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thanks","id":"thanks"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/820184","id":"820184"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/820189","id":"820189"}]},{"id":819650,"author":"123js49","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Gynaecology procedure","body":"I received an appointment to attend within 2 days of a scan result felt a bit nervous about the outcome.

Julie-Anne and Rachel were so attentive and made me feel well cared for. Nothing was any trouble. They were so warm and caring.  \r\nAs I wasn’t to get surgery until the following morning and hadn’t eaten all day they made me tea and toast. I was visited by the register Lyndsey and again she was great and explained things really clearly. I couldn’t have asked for better care. The next morning I was told I was going for surgery and Mark the anaesthetist went through the procedure and reassured me about the surgery. I was nervous about surgery and so when was taken to theatre Mark and the team were very reassuring. I felt in safe hands.  \r\nI woke up in recovery where again I was looked after by a fantastic team of nurses. I was weak with hunger so they made me tea and toast. They checked on me regularly and again the care I received was fantastic. I was then moved to 4North and Holly looked after me that evening. She was great, so personable and friendly. At a time that was very traumatic and scary I cannot praise the teams at CAH enough. I always felt safe, informed and the compassionate care I received was excellent! A big thank you to everyone.

I was put on a monitor and then assessed for the fitting of a pacemaker. At all times the staff were compassionate, kind, sensitive to my anxieties, supportive, reassuring and considerate of my needs. I would like to recommend Albert for a special mention as his smiley face and sense of humour were such a morale booster. He was such a shining light!! Other members of staff on this ward were so caring from the Lead Sister, Vicky, to the lovely tea lady, Shirley. Every area was well serviced and the whole ward seemed to jog along like a well oiled machine. Nothing was too much trouble for any one of the staff and, obviously Vicky led from the front and was well supported by Deputy Sisters Gemma and Amanda. Ethel is another member of staff worthy of a mention, she is such a warm hearted, caring, lovely lady. It is very hard to single out any other members of staff as name labels were covered with the plastic aprons!! I would like to say that the care and courteous manner with which I was treated by everyone could not have been bettered had I paid!  \r\nThere is, of course, an exception to this rule. Sad to say that the technician who carried out an ultra sound, was not in the least courteous. I couldn't tell you what they were called as they never introduced themselves, just turned up at the ward door (I was in a single room), with a machine and proceeded to move the bed, asking if I could help (?) and the locker, so that they could get the machine into the room. I eventually had to ask them what they were doing, after they removed my pyjama top and covered part of my body with a sheet. I had a cannular in my left arm and was asked to hold my left breast out of the way of this instrument. I could only do this for a short period of time as the needle, in the cannular, was becoming really painful. I tried to use my right arm, but was told, quite sharply, that that was no good. This is the only time, during my stay in CCU that I just felt like a piece of meat on a butcher's slab. There has to be an exception to the rule and this person was it for me. Good manner cost nothing and the least this person could have done was to introduce themselves and tell me what they were going to do. Not rocket science.  \r\nEveryone else, First Class Treatment, First Class Caring and First Class Professionalism.  \r\nI would like to commend all the Cardiologist team. They kept me in the picture about what was going to happen and I had every confidence in them. The surgeon who did the procedure, Mr. Ahkmed, (apologies for the spelling) was just fantastic and confidence came out of every pore.

I would like to thank you and everyone in the Relapse Prevention group for all the help and support you gave me. All of you made me stronger and ready for a new chapter in my life, which I am very excited about. I started One Recovery exactly one year ago. I went through hills and mountains to be in the place I am right now. In the first few months there were lots of tears, lots of anger, lots of emotions, which were changing just like a tornado changing directions unexpectedly. I had a relapse and lapse, which later on I realised that actually it made me even stronger. I felt like a toddler who is trying to learn how to walk again. Every fall I had I was getting up and walking even more comfortable. But I had so many hands picking me up everytime I fell. Those hands made me stronger and steadier on my feet. You were those hands. I have to say, iIt was a rollercoaster ride. Then came the calm after the storm, realizing how much I archived by staying sober. How much I gained in the eyes of my child and my husband's. There I was, in front of them, the way I should be at all times. Just pure me, not hiding behind the glass of wine, not drowning in tears every morning, not being hungover and feeling ashamed and disgusted with myself. The day came when I was finally happy.  \r\nEveryone in One Recovery was part of my journey and I will be always extremely grateful for everything. I will always keep you all in my prayers, to give you strength to achieve anything you desire.  \r\nStay strong!!!!! You can do it. If I did it you can do it as well. ☺  \r\nI will miss you all very much.  \r\nStay strong.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-02-02T09:34:28.6066667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-02-02T12:06:16.34","readBy":[{"name":"Midlands Partnership NHS Foundation Trust","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/819874","id":"819874"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/819874/responses","id":"819874"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/819874/healthservices","id":"819874"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/819874/tags","id":"819874"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rrex4-buckinghamshire-stars","id":"RREX4-buckinghamshire-stars","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anger","id":"anger"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disgusted","id":"disgusted"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/end%20of%20life","id":"end of life"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/excited","id":"excited"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/eyes","id":"eyes"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fall","id":"fall"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fall%20prevention","id":"fall prevention"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/feeling","id":"feeling"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/feet","id":"feet"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fell","id":"fell"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/group","id":"group"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lapse","id":"lapse"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/relapse","id":"relapse"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stronger","id":"stronger"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/walk","id":"walk"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/walking","id":"walking"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/calm","id":"calm"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happy","id":"happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20happy","id":"not happy"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/819919","id":"819919"}]},{"id":819751,"author":"Danmz93","authorRoleId":8,"authorRole":"a staff member posting for a patient/service user","title":"Family Service","body":"I just wanted to say a huge thankyou to your and the whole One Recovery Team for setting up the new Peer Support Group. I cannot tell you how fantastic it already is. We have set up a WhatsApp group and have already lent each other so much support. It is a sign of these COVID times that such a group is needed. We would naturally have left normal, face to face group therapy and gravitated to each other to form support and friendship bubbles. This lack of this physical contact and natural progression must have put a massive pressure and on your already overburdened services. I do hope it alleviates a little of your workloads, as I feel sure we will become the rocks to each other that we have relied solely upon you for over the last many months.

Our baby arrived after 4 nights and the staff on the ward couldn't have been better. I had been due to give birth elsewhere and knew the team there so was anxious about the move but the midwives, assistants and Doctors couldn't have been better. On the ward Joanne, Jessica and Shelley couldn't have done more for me, along with the rest of the girls. They helped keep my morale up as I got tired of waiting around both before and after the birth. They also helped ensure our breastfeeding journey got off to the best start it possibly could have, spending time with us that I really needed. They managed to make me laugh when I was feeling at my lowest and were a listening ear when I was struggling on the notorious day 3! Shelley was training as a student at the time but I know she is going to be one of the most amazing midwives, that I would love to have by my side again. On the labour ward, particularly Esther and Dr Donald along with the rest of the team made my birthing experience one that I will never forget for all the right reasons. They talked me through every step, including me in all decisions and helping me to feel comfortable and safe when things got a little difficult. As I have had previous health problems of my own, I was aware my birth plan was a hope rather than set in stone, but they still made attempts to respect this whilst keeping me and our son safe. Esther in particular, was a ray of sunshine who both me, my husband and my mum, told everyone about after the birth. However, we honestly couldn't speak more highly of them all as a team. They are a credit to their professions and I don't think any of them realise how amazing they truly are.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-01-30T21:03:32.36","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-02-02T12:26:12.083","readBy":[{"name":"Northern Health and Social Care Trust","count":8}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/819657","id":"819657"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/819657/responses","id":"819657"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/819657/healthservices","id":"819657"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/819657/tags","id":"819657"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt002_24027_501","id":"ZT002_24027_501","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt002-aah-delivery-suite","id":"zt002-aah-delivery-suite","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/birth","id":"birth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breastfeeding%20support","id":"Breastfeeding Support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/food","id":"food"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helped","id":"helped"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kind%20staff","id":"kind staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/labour","id":"labour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/listening%20to%20me","id":"Listening to me"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/maternity","id":"maternity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/midwives","id":"midwives"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/respectful","id":"respectful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/safe","id":"safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/understanding","id":"understanding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vegetarian%20food","id":"vegetarian food"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing","id":"amazing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20for","id":"cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hope","id":"Hope"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/person%20centred%20care","id":"Person centred care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/space%20on%20ward","id":"space on ward"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/partner%20support","id":"partner support"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/819918","id":"819918"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/820079","id":"820079"}]},{"id":819668,"author":"Jo1jd99","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Disgusting food","body":"The food is so bad it doesn’t matter how hungry I was, I just couldn’t eat it.","criticality":"minimally critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-01-31T07:45:59.5","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-02-02T12:28:20.003","readBy":[{"name":"East Suffolk and North Essex NHS Foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/819668","id":"819668"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/819668/responses","id":"819668"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/819668/healthservices","id":"819668"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/819668/tags","id":"819668"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rdee4","id":"RDEE4","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/food%20quality","id":"food quality"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/820022","id":"820022"}]},{"id":819683,"author":"Alalf","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"My Covid Jab","body":"I booked my vaccination for 13-20 in the afternoon.

A nurse came in and spoke to one of the patients, then came back moments later with a jug of water and a cup. I just thought that meant we were only allowed water after we had had certain tests taken.  \r\nAround an hour after I arrived a doctor assessed me and took some blood, It was painless . The doctor was very professional, and very patient as I explained my pain and recent lack of sleep. I returned to the waiting area and was told that somebody would check on me intermittently. Over the next 2 hours, a few nurses came and went; checking on other patients in the waiting area.  \r\nI had been trying to cope with the pain because I knew it was only a matter of time until it would get sorted, but I was really struggling, so I went to find a nurse. There were about 5 nurses in the ward next to the waiting area, I said excuse me a few times until one of them met my eyes. I asked if I could please have some painkillers. The nurse told me to go and sit down and someone will bring me something. So I returned to the waiting area, shivering with pain and at this point I had not had anything to drink for about 4 hours.  \r\n40 minutes later, I returned to the nurses and begged them for some pain relief explaining that I had made the same request 40 minutes prior. I was told to be patient because they were very busy. Two minutes later a nurse appeared with two co-codamol, a jug of water and a cup. This lead me to believe that they had ignored or forgotten my first request. I took the medication. Sometime in the next hour, as the pain eased, I noticed a whiteboard on the wall opposite me which read amongst other things \"please help yourself to water until you have been fully assessed\". And I realised that there was no reason for me or anyone else to be sitting dehydrated. There should have been water available at minimum, because if it takes over 40 minutes to administer painkillers, how long it would have taken had I requested a drink?  \r\nThe specialist who ended up treating me and the nurse who aided were both fantastic and very sympathetic about the pain I was in as soon as they saw the affected area. They both apologised for how long I had been waiting.  \r\nI feel that some of the nurses on the ward that I encountered misread my pain as rudeness. I begged for help and felt that I was treated like a pest and told to be \"patient\". I am sure there are plenty of conscientious nurses working at Ninewells. I just felt it was important to give fully honest feedback.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-01-31T10:00:28.09","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-02-02T13:38:37.383","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Tayside","count":29},{"name":"St. Andrews University ScotGEM Medical Students","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/819671","id":"819671"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/819671/responses","id":"819671"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/819671/healthservices","id":"819671"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/819671/tags","id":"819671"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/t101h_100","id":"T101H_100","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/t101h-acute-surgical","id":"t101h-acute-surgical","score":3},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frustrated","id":"frustrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ignored","id":"ignored"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unimportant","id":"Unimportant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/access%20to%20pain%20relief","id":"access to pain relief"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breast%20clinic","id":"breast clinic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctor","id":"doctor"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/painkillers","id":"painkillers"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/patient%20care","id":"patient care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professional","id":"professional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/skin","id":"skin"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting","id":"waiting"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/refreshments","id":"refreshments"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/forgotten%20about","id":"forgotten about"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/abscess%20drainage","id":"abscess drainage"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breast%20specialist","id":"breast specialist"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/820630","id":"820630"}]},{"id":819782,"author":"woodpigeonmg36","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Really really well done","body":"I had my Covid 19 Vaccination today and I have to say it was excellent.

I appreciated the care and concern shown by those nurses who clearly 'knew the ropes'.

Thanks Hannah and Clare and a special shout out to Mary who went out of her way to find me gluten free toast!  \r\nMy experience was not all reassuring, with many staff new to the ward or appearing inexperienced requiring supervision, maybe due to staffing shortages? In 5 days, 7 different surgeons spoke briefly to me and while I understand the enormous pressures they are under, continuity and taking time to explain would have really helped to give clarity and reduce anxiety.  \r\nThank you to the staff who keep on going, when patients return home still you go on.","criticality":"mildly
