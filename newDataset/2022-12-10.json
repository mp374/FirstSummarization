After discussing  symptoms with Receptionist she got me the last one available to see Nurse Practitioner. I had walked down to surgery on off chance for advice. Despite them being very short staffed due to illness ( yes they are human) I was impressed  by the care I was given by Reception. The Nurse Practitioner saw me later that day and after examining me, taking history I was prescribed medication. I was so appreciative - and have a chance of feeling well for Christmas  now. I am on track for follow up if things don't improve. The  Pharmacy work v.hard in a small space- and obtained my medication for me. I have always found this Surgery to be there for me when I need medical help. I understand my part in the process though, and use their online system to order drugs ( in good time to recieve them ) manage symptoms myself ( before requesting  an appointment) and if it was necessary - go to A&E or a walk in centre. Their  online website information  gives good medical advice on simple ailments and what to do in an Emergency.  I feel as a Patient it is my responsibility to understand how the NHS can help me and what is my part in the process.

I've been at this surgery all my life and having to call at a specific time on the day along side the rest of the town is just ludicrous.

Unfortunately, it was 3d stage (neuroborreliosis) already. Now I am feeling much better after the long treatment although some things were already seriously damaged (balance, joints).

This hospital lacked in so many aspects. I arrived struggling to breathe to the point where I was coughing non stop when the nurses were doing my vital checks, I was also struggling to speak.  I arrived at 22:30pm on 09-10-22. Many people were pushed in-front of me, whilst I understand some cases may be severe but a handful of individuals who went before me (even though I had arrived hours before them) had conditions and symptoms that were less severe than mine. I waited over 12 hours and was seen the next day at 11:00am. Over 12 hours to be seen. I have a family of doctors and can really sympathise but the way this hospital in particular is running with the increased amount of A&E patients is terrible. There needs to be a system in place to support each patient without having to make them wait A day to be seen. The doctors need to have a more clear list to follow and should have a rule of only pushing individuals at the back of the waiting list with only one person being placed in front and not multiple. I unfortunately lost count of how many were pushed in-front of me. Secondly, the Nmc of conduct states compassion and empathy, the majority of the staff in this hospital had shown 0 remorse for what was unfolding in front of them. And when anyone tried to approach the staff, that to politely, they kept ignoring and running into their private rooms. Very unprofessional. A review  of the hospital really needs to be put in place as I am shocked at what I witnessed today. I am shocked at the standards of practice.

Rang back, waited an hour on hold, finally got my call answered and was given an appointment. A few days later someone from the surgery rang back and left me an answer phone message to cancel my appointment and asked me to ring the surgery back to book another!  \nAs if the cost of the phone calls wasn't enough in the first place I then ended up taking unpaid time off work and doing an hour round trip to visit the practice only to be told I could only get one if I rang in at 8 am the next day. I was then asked (in the very quiet waiting room) if I could tell them know exactly what the problem was and why I needed an appointment, this was in front of 3 people waiting (one of which had already contributed to my conversation about the wait as they had had a similar experience so they could obviously hear what I was saying). As this was very personal information I was not happy to provide this and politely declined. Eventually, I managed to persuade someone to allocate me an appointment and I was sent an appointment text message at 8 am the next day with a time of 14:55 for that day. Unfortunately, I had been up all night with a stomach bug so I was unable to attend so I tried to call the surgery again to cancel. I held for another hour on the phone and then gave up - my husband also tried for me later too and he waited for an hour on the phone and, like me, gave up too. We then found a form on the Larksfield website which I filled in to cancel instead. It was a good few hours before the appointment so plenty of notice given to allocate this appointment to someone else. I then received a text to say that I hadn't attended my appointment. Presumably, this will go on my notes and look bad when I rebook, if I ever manage to get another appointment, that is! :-(    \nVery odd that there are relatively few people waiting in the waiting room and no phones can be heard ringing in the background. It is almost too quiet there now, personal information can easily be overheard and is not confidential at all. \nDuring lockdown the service provided by the practice was fantastic - there was an econsult process in place.

I feel that my ulcer would have been healed by now.  \r\nBy putting up with months of attending a general practice clinic three times a week, having sometimes very painful dressings, I feel that this has contributed to my high levels of anxiety, for which I am now having treatment.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-12-06T11:40:18.2533333","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2022-12-11T15:20:03.617","readBy":[],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1004801","id":"1004801"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1004801/responses","id":"1004801"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1004801/healthservices","id":"1004801"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1004801/tags","id":"1004801"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/c84055","id":"C84055","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/clinic","id":"clinic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/considerate","id":"considerate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dressings","id":"dressings"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helpful","id":"helpful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kind","id":"kind"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/leg%20ulcer","id":"leg ulcer"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pleased","id":"pleased"}]},{"id":1005339,"author":"Super","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Timing","body":"Every time I come for my diabetes appointments, I have to wait over 20minutes.  \r\nThis service cannot manage their appointments in my opinion, yet they seem to expect patients to rebook if they are late for an appointment.","criticality":"minimally critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-12-07T10:24:17.7766667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-12-11T15:20:04.193","readBy":[{"name":"City & Hackney GP Confederation","count":3},{"name":"Rosewood Practice","count":2},{"name":"Ulster University, MBBS (Medicine) 2021","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1005339","id":"1005339"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1005339/responses","id":"1005339"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1005339/healthservices","id":"1005339"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1005339/tags","id":"1005339"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/f84711","id":"F84711","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/annoyed","id":"annoyed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appointments","id":"appointments"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diabetic","id":"diabetic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/management","id":"management"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/time","id":"time"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting","id":"waiting"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/service","id":"service"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1009693","id":"1009693"}]},{"id":1006898,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Brilliant caring doctors.

They were super prompt in finding me a bed in marsh ward. The midwives were lovely and got the induction process moving quickly. They discussed my options and I opted for the balloon . This has to remain for 24 hours before next assessment. I was given the option to go home for this time, or to stay in hospital. I chose to stay in hospital in case anything happened (I.e balloon coming out)  My partner was allowed to stay while I was there which was lovely. \nWhen I was ready for delivery, I was taken to the delivery suite where 2 (again lovely) midwives stayed with me the whole 9 hour labor, they monitored me and baby constantly and kept me informed as there were several potential complications they were keeping a close eye on. My natural birth turned into an emergency c-section due to further complications and the whole team were just amazingly quick to act and to deliver my baby as safely as possible. They kept me informed of everything happening. \nI was rushed into theatre within minutes of the decision being made where the surgical team were waiting and didn’t waste a single minute. My baby girl was safely delivered and I was sutured up within 20 minutes of entering. Absolutely incredible surgical team. \nI was then taken to iffley ward where I stayed for a further 2 nights. The midwives were incredible. There was one midwife in particular( I called her my angel )  who really looked after me, from helping me clean myself up changing my padded underwear. To realising I was shattered and taking my daughter away for a couple of hours to feed and look after so I could get some sleep. And just being super chatty and friendly.\nMy blood pressure etc was monitored regularly to make sure I was ok. \nMy daughter was monitored closely too.\nThey came to every alarm call, yes, you could be waiting a few minutes at a time, but these nurses were absolutely rushed off their feet . They were all working so hard. \nThe care I received from all the staff in all the departments of maternity was outstanding and although my birth plan didn’t go according to plan, they all played their part in making me feel safe, secure and making the experience as stress free as possible.

After 3 hours one of the consultants came out to the waiting room shouting that parents needed to stop asking reception and the initial assessment nursing staff how much longer they would be waiting. I think this needs to be addressed and the staff need to be mindful that these are very worried parents with seriously unwell children who are being made to wait fourteen hours, and maybe adjust attitudes / patient care a little.

December last.   After a ridiculous amount of time wasted in a telephone queue ( in excess of 30 waiters ), I chose to visit the surgery in my efforts to try and obtain an appointment.  After waiting in another line for more than 20 minutes, I finally got to speak to your receptionist, explaining that my visit was a last resort effort to speak to somebody.  I need a face-to-face appointment, as my medical predicament is not appropriate for a telephone consultation, but also, I am profoundly deaf, so such an appointment is clearly not suitable for me.   Your receptionist told me that there were no 'walk-in' appointments available for that day, and I would need to phone in, or visit at 08.00 hrs. to have a greater chance of sustaining such an appointment; - I explained that I had found this process unfruitful.  \n I was then told that there were no appointment slots available - with any doctor before Christmas - let alone my own, -  so I asked for one after the Xmas period.  Again, I was told that no appointment could be made for me at this time.  I took the only subsequent advice afforded me, and phoned the 111 emergency service, which I am pleased to say, did find me a time slot, that day, at another practice in Whitstable, where a Nurse Practitioner examined me physically, and prescribed medication. The Nurse told me that I should make an appointment with my own doctor within the next week, for \"A Review\" of my condition.  When I mentioned that I had found this difficult, I was told that I need to be assertive, and insist on seeing my Doctor personally.   Now, from my experiences detailed above, I very much doubt that this is going to prove possible, so perhaps you can understand my predicament here, and thus I must ask you for your advice and guidance on a suitable way forward for me. \nI trust you will agree that I have not been afforded a very good service on this occasion.
