My wife phoned our G.P. who advised phoning 999 immediately. The ambulance arrived within minutes and I was taken to the A. & E. at Borders General Hospital at Melrose.  \r\nI was examined, had several tests and was told that a perforated appendix was suspected. After a C.T. Scan I was taken to theatre at half-past midnight.  \r\nI regained consciousness sometime the next morning in ITU where I remained for the next six days. For most of my stay in ITU I suffered from delirium and must here apologise to the staff who I now realise must have had a tough time coping with my hallucinations. I then went to Ward 7 for a further week and then released to home aided by the Home First Team. The regular daily visits by the nurses along with the visits from the district nurse, who looked after my wound, were really appreciated as was the attention of the Physio Dept.  \r\nNow, after some ten weeks, I am well on the way to complete recovery.  \r\nI must send my thanks to the wonderful treatment and kindness I received from everyone, the ambulance medics, all the many nurses, doctors, surgeons, physiotherapists, porters, cleaners and all the others who helped me in so many ways.

I was completely in shock made even worse by them saying the Macmillan Nurse would be along presently to talk to me. My initial reaction to the way this was all delivered was that I was likely to die. I didn’t at that point know what to think and to be honest really didn’t take much in. I did wake up in the middle of the night and went through to our spare bedroom to cry, it was just so alien.  \r\nHowever, under the wing of a marvellous haematology consultant I had my fears put to rest and things came back into perspective - it is slow growing non-hodgins and I am ‘watch and wait’. At some appointments, however, I felt I wasn’t getting answers to questions or they were being misinterpreted (only when I was seeing one specific doctor and felt there might be a bit of a language barrier but this happened a few times).  \r\nI did get transferred to the lymphoma clinic at the Churchill Hospital where I have seen several fantastic consultants and feel that I am very lucky to be getting the care I do. One particular consultant that we’ve been very fortunate to see several times explained more in the first consultation with them than anyone else previously.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-03-24T15:23:11.0833333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-03-25T09:50:32.58","readBy":[{"name":"Royal Berkshire NHS Foundation Trust","count":2},{"name":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS foundation Trust Haematology Department","count":1},{"name":"Ulster University, MBBS (Medicine) 2021","count":1},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2020)","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/752679","id":"752679"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/752679/responses","id":"752679"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/752679/healthservices","id":"752679"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/752679/tags","id":"752679"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rhw01_303","id":"RHW01_303","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rth02_303","id":"RTH02_303","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breasts","id":"breasts"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/consultant","id":"consultant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diagnosis","id":"diagnosis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fortunate","id":"fortunate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lymphoma","id":"lymphoma"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassurance","id":"reassurance"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/feel%20very%20lucky","id":"Feel very lucky"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/explanations","id":"explanations"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/delivering%20news","id":"delivering news"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/752799","id":"752799"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/758399","id":"758399"}]},{"id":752681,"author":"kelvin27","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"I now have no-one looking after my foot","body":"I have been in a care home in Portsmouth for the last 17 months and have been seeing the local district nurses for that time.

I have always said i cant say I suffer with depression because I was still able to live my day to day life. But last year I suffered, I was bedridden sleeping for up to 20 hours a day, I often thought of ending everything and felt useless. My confidence was already low but it hit rock bottom.  \r\nI contacted Inclusion Thurrock and was given an appointment with Jo a CBT therapist. Having had therapy in the past I didn't hold out much hope but I went into this determined to get out of the dark hole I was in and I think that helped so much. I embraced everything that was said and done my homework that Jo gave me.  \r\nI cant thank Jo enough for what she did for me and undoubtedly does for others.

They are wonderful people so very caring, I have had around 8 different people visit and help me and they are all so obliging. It isn’t easy coming into another person’s home or having people I don’t know come into my home, but they have all been so obliging and kind. They help me to wash and dress and they lay out my breakfast and other meals for me. I can’t open some things at the moment so they help with that too and they all ask what else they can do to help me.  \r\nTheir care has helped relax my son about my care also. With everything going on right now the carer’s ring me before a visit to ask if I have any symptoms of the Coronavirus and have assured me that should I show any signs they will still visit and help me they will just take extra precautions which is very reassuring.

She was told to either wait in the car or go home and come back. I found the staff very rude, and considering the current situation with the Coronavirus, was outraged that one specific nurse spoke that close to me that I could actually smell their breath.  \r\nI was given the option of 2 gowns to wear, one which had no ties on, the other which had a massive hole near the groin area, meaning people could see my private parts. I tried to get the attention of a nurse regarding this, but they were too busy chatting to even notice me. After an hour of waiting for my procedure I asked how long it would be, as my sister who came with me was waiting in the car. They couldn’t tell me anything. So I waited for two hours for my procedure, without being told by anyone that they were running late ect and was offered no apology. I was told I would have gas and air, and shown how to correctly breath it in ect, however during the procedure was never given any.  \r\nOverall, I was very disappointed by their efforts and hope they can work on this for the sake of other patients.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-03-25T13:50:38.1533333","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2020-03-25T15:31:59.627","readBy":[{"name":"United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust","count":10},{"name":"Sheffield University Medical School 2020","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/752764","id":"752764"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/752764/responses","id":"752764"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/752764/healthservices","id":"752764"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/752764/tags","id":"752764"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rwdlp_100","id":"RWDLP_100","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disappointed","id":"disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cleanliness","id":"cleanliness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctor","id":"doctor"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gas%20and%20air","id":"gas and air"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kept%20informed","id":"kept informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/running%20late","id":"running late"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/coronavirus","id":"coronavirus"}]},{"id":752775,"author":"importerqe37","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Emergency treatment","body":"Over here on holiday from New Zealand I woke up very dizzy, nauseous and fatigue.

This was combined with great humanity, compassion and personal support for my family through the anxious stages whilst I was on the ventilator. The patient diary has been a valuable tool in enabling me to comprehend and process the experience. \n\n I also thought that the holistic approach to my rehabilitation was excellent. They aimed to help me get back to normal as soon as possible which was both sensitive and very motivating.\n\n However for me the most extraordinary feature of Critical Care was the team work and passion. The collaborative and ever present consultant team, the patient focussed cross disciplinary working, and the diligence of the healthcare assistants and other support staff. However, I would like to particularly highlight the passion, commitment, unified purpose and unquestioning mutual support within the  nursing team. This standard and consistency, when they are caring for so many different people,  is incredibly hard to achieve and is an enormous credit to all involved. On behalf of myself and my family I would like to say a very big 'thank you' for the care and support we received.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-03-25T15:52:47","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-03-25T17:22:25","readBy":[{"name":"North West Anglia NHS Foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/752810","id":"752810"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/752810/responses","id":"752810"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/752810/healthservices","id":"752810"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/752810/tags","id":"752810"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rgn80","id":"RGN80","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxious","id":"anxious"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20cared%20for","id":"not cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20about","id":"Cared about"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/normal","id":"normal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pneumonia","id":"pneumonia"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/rehabilitation","id":"rehabilitation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20for","id":"cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/like%20family","id":"like family"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/753295","id":"753295"}]},{"id":752811,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Terrible receptionists ","body":"Spoke to the receptionists on the phone many times but they can’t seem to bothered to help with my issue, telling me to ‘ring back next week’ at least four weeks in a row when I really ought to be sorted straight away with my therapist and therapist doctor telling me it’s urgent I be delt with straight away.

I then asked my daughter to call and chase if they were ready as I had been given 2 emails that didn’t work the reception staff was shouting down the phone that she didn’t didn’t have time to call patients to tell them their prescriptions are ready. This was all after the GP ensuring I could buy specific supplements in a health shop so spent hours searching for them to be told they needed prescribing. If they had done what was asked on my discharge letter it would have saved me (who is at risk after just having major surgery) from going to multiple pharmacies and health shops looking for a medication that they should have prescribed in the first place. \n\nI have just had major surgery and my medications are really important to take. Particularly in the current situation your staff need to learn to be a bit more polite and considerate to how patients are feeling. \n\nI would of thought after multiple bad reviews about your reception staff that you would have given them some training on how to speak to patients. \n\nYet again disappointed in this practice.

Approximately 2 year's ago my husband had to call NHS 24 and the Nurse who came and the ambulance people were wonderful, so my husband told me because I can't remember! I was taken to Ward 7c at Raigmore Hospital and was shocked at how short staffed they were but saying that, the treatment I received from the Nurses and the Junior Dr.s was wonderful but I have a new hero and that is Thoracic Consultant, Dr. Paterson who found when he looked at my Xray, that there was a shadow area. He organised for me to have a biopsy and scans and I was diagnosed with Adenocarcinoma in the top lobe of my right lung. Dr. Paterson then organised for me to have a Lobectomy at the Golden Jubilee Hospital in Glasgow which was also, mostly, amazing. A wonderful Surgeon!  \r\nI cannot thank Dr. Paterson's team enough because they are incredible and as for Dr. Paterson, he was so kind and he saved my life where another department had missed diagnosing the tumour. I will never, ever forget his kindness and his dedication and I hope that Raigmore treasure him because it's rare, I have found, to have a Consultant who listens to what you are saying and how you feel. A wonderful Dr. and a wonderful team and it feels so inadequate to say thank you but thank you so, so much. I would also like to wish all the NHS Staff at Raigmore and all through Scotland and Britain all the very best wishes. I think you are ALL so brave and thank you so much for all that you do. Good luck, take care and please be safe and know how much we care about you all. Dr. Paterson and the team, please take care and be very safe.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-03-25T22:49:14.16","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-03-26T10:07:49.83","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Highland","count":8},{"name":"Scottish Ambulance Service","count":13},{"name":"Golden Jubilee National Hospital","count":3},{"name":"Scottish Government","count":2},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":1},{"name":"Office of Rhoda Grant, MSP for Highlands and Islands","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/752828","id":"752828"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/752828/responses","id":"752828"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/752828/healthservices","id":"752828"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/752828/tags","id":"752828"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/d102h-thoracic","id":"D102H-thoracic","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/h202h_340","id":"H202H_340","score":5},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/scot-ambulance","id":"scot-ambulance","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/worried","id":"worried"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/biopsy","id":"biopsy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cancer","id":"cancer"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/consultant","id":"consultant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kind","id":"kind"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lobe","id":"lobe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lung","id":"lung"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lung%20biopsy","id":"lung biopsy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lung%20cancer","id":"lung cancer"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/paramedics","id":"paramedics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pneumonia","id":"pneumonia"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/short%20staffed","id":"short staffed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20listened","id":"Staff listened"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgeon","id":"surgeon"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/team","id":"team"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thoracic","id":"thoracic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tumour","id":"Tumour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/xray","id":"Xray"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hope","id":"Hope"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported","id":"supported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/saved","id":"saved"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/752922","id":"752922"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/752935","id":"752935"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/753185","id":"753185"}]},{"id":752718,"author":"Mummypie","authorRoleId":3,"authorRole":"a parent/guardian","title":"My sons delayed speech and suspected autism","body":"After my sons 2 year review I was told about the classes at our local children’s centre and that they could help with his speech, he is only saying 1 word at this point and just babbling the rest of the time.  \r\nI went along and straight away felt comfortable being there and talking to the girls, they have so much help and advice to offer, not long after I had a call from Charlotte the home talk worker.

patient","title":"An excellent experience","body":"After a weekend of severe headaches I contacted my GP for an appointment, only to be told to call for an ambulance, which I did. We were given an approximate timeframe but subsequently called and asked if possible to make our own way to The Royal Cornwall hospital, which we did.  \r\nDropped off at the main entrance, I sat and waited whilst my husband parked. Clearly unwell, a member of the reception team immediately came over and got a wheelchair ready. We were directed to Minors and staff when out of their way to help at busy lifts.  \r\nRegistration was friendly and straightforward and when I was seen by the team they took w thorough history and explained what they would do next. Bloods kindly taken (always hard to find a vein) and the CT scan followed quite quickly. Someone let me know of a slight delay because of a wait for a test result and when I saw the team again there had been a shift change. The new team rechecked my history and explained that although all the results were good, given my age and how the headaches started, they would like to do a lumber puncture in addition. To my surprise, they hope to be able to complete it that evening so if clear I could go home.  \r\nShortly after a move to the treatment area (near the discharge lounge). I doctor was found shortly after to undertake the lumber puncture. I was given a clear explanation and the option of my husband joining me, which he did. Part of the explanation included that sometimes it is difficult to draw fluid – which it was in my case. A second doctor was called. Both maintained a relaxed and appropriately light-hearted approach whilst the second (and successful) attempt was made, and they ensured I was comfortable and confident throughout.  \r\nThere was quite a long wait for the results as lab teams were smaller in the evenings, but I was pre-warned of this and given progress updates. Refreshments and sandwiches were made available of us, and the other 6-8 people in the treatment lounge area. Throughout we noticed all patients were being regularly updated and helped as needed  \r\nGiven clear results – my bad headaches where just that – but staff also give me advice to follow up with my GP if they continued.  \r\nAn excellent experience and my thanks to all of the staff who helped me that day  \r\nKeep safe","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-03-25T15:54:19.1566667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-03-26T10:40:48.773","readBy":[{"name":"Royal Cornwall Hospitals NHS Trust","count":8}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/752791","id":"752791"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/752791/responses","id":"752791"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/752791/healthservices","id":"752791"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/752791/tags","id":"752791"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/ref12_300","id":"REF12_300","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/advice","id":"advice"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ct%20scan","id":"CT scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/headaches","id":"headaches"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helped","id":"helped"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/included","id":"included"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/informative","id":"informative"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kept%20informed","id":"kept informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kind","id":"kind"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lumbar%20puncture","id":"lumbar puncture"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professional","id":"professional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attitude","id":"staff attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thorough","id":"thorough"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thoughtful","id":"thoughtful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confident","id":"confident"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/relaxed","id":"relaxed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/explanations","id":"explanations"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/753260","id":"753260"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/753305","id":"753305"}]},{"id":752792,"author":"bonanzape84","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"IRIS team were all lovely","body":"My father was diagnosed with Alzheimer's approx July 2019.

I was referred to Raigmore with pain under my right ribs but unfortunately, was sent, firstly for a Sigmoidoscopy where the staff member I saw treated me as though I was a hypochondriac and said that I didn't need the procedure. When I complained about this, it was denied and excuses were made. The Nurses were and are wonderful however.  \r\nThen I was sent to another specialist who sent me for Scans, Colonoscopy etc. and after a year I became angry and asked why they were still looking at the large bowel when I kept complaining about pain under my right ribs and had lost a lot of weight. I felt that the doctors were judging me because I had suffered with anxiety and depression. Long story short, it turned out I had pneumonia and my wonderful Thoracic Consultant found that I had a tumour in my lung. That tumour had shown on a previous Xray 2 year's previously but had been overlooked or ignored!  \r\nI will never, ever trust that department again. I would love beg them to listen to their patients because we know our bodies and are not going to tell lies about our health.

When it came to the operation day I was completely fine apart from the early hour of 6 am that I had to wake up in the morning to leave at 6.45 am for hospital to get there on time.  \r\nAfter arriving I was brought up to my room shared with 2 others where multiple doctors and nurses came to talk to me about the procedure. Where I was also revisited by the person that did my pre-operation to see how I was feeling. It got to about afternoon time where I was given a stress ball to keep, not long after I was taken to get put on the anesthetic to help me go to sleep. I was still anxious and felt worse breathing in the air but the nurses and doctors did an amazing job at keeping me calm. When I woke up they where there helping me to wake up and checking I was healthy before taking me back to the room for food and water finally (can't eat before operation).  \r\nThank you Debbie - play specialist for your help.

Everyone stay safe and keep well.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-03-20T17:09:59.3066667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-03-26T11:31:31.093","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":10}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/749703","id":"749703"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/749703/responses","id":"749703"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/749703/healthservices","id":"749703"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/749703/tags","id":"749703"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sj9-orthopaedics","id":"SJ9-orthopaedics","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hopeless","id":"Hopeless"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hip","id":"hip"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hip%20replacement","id":"hip replacement"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/osteoarthritis","id":"osteoarthritis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain%20management","id":"pain management"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/terrible","id":"terrible"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting%20lists","id":"waiting lists"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wheelchair","id":"wheelchair"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/752991","id":"752991"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/752998","id":"752998"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/753291","id":"753291"}]},{"id":745909,"author":"Gobsmaked","authorRoleId":4,"authorRole":"a relative","title":"Not satisfied with the care received","body":"This company took over the care of my Dad around a year ago, this was to wash and dress him in the morning and get him ready for bed in the evening.

One worker would finish their work and whilst the other worker wrote in the notes, they would stand at the front door smoking and throwing butt ends around. I would then visit my mum and the house would smell of smoke, my Dad has asthma.  \r\nThis worker also thinks it's acceptable to throw a can of deodorant across my parents living room, when asked not to on several occasions they reply that they throw it gently!  \r\nWe have found that the workers have in the past written false times in my Dads Notes, stating they were at My parents house when they weren't.  \r\nOne worker arrived at my parents house and whilst looking at my Dad said more than once-is it ready. When my Mum asked was what ready, the worker pointed at my Dad. My Dad is a person not an \"it\".  \r\nThis list goes on and on, we have complained to management but feel we are not listened to. in fact the last conversation resulting in me getting really angry, we don't need to be fighting a battle with a care company, my Dad is dying we have enough to be dealing with as his health deteriorates.  \r\nOur next steps are an official complaint, through Sheffield city council and quality care commission.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-02-29T17:34:22.83","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2020-03-26T12:20:01.057","readBy":[],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/745909","id":"745909"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/745909/responses","id":"745909"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/745909/healthservices","id":"745909"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/745909/tags","id":"745909"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/1-4190959590","id":"1-4190959590","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/angry","id":"angry"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appalling","id":"appalling"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20being%20listened%20to","id":"not being listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20listened%20to","id":"not listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stress","id":"stress"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20upset","id":"very upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/asthma","id":"asthma"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dying","id":"dying"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/corticobasal%20degeneration","id":"Corticobasal degeneration"}]},{"id":749380,"author":"Greystones gal","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Excellent care from all members of the team","body":"I am so impressed that despite the current challenges, your team are continuing to be as respectful, professional and caring as ever.  \r\nI have been treated with respect by all staff members: admin staff, doctors and nurses.  \r\nThis makes a huge difference because it builds trust and means that I feel comfortable being open and honest with the team.  \r\nIt also empowers me to make positive changes and look after my own health.Thank you for all that you do for the patients and the local community.You make a huge positive difference to our lives and I am very grateful for you.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-03-18T20:45:59.4433333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-03-26T12:20:01.417","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Sheffield ICB","count":4}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/749380","id":"749380"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/749380/responses","id":"749380"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/749380/healthservices","id":"749380"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/749380/tags","id":"749380"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/c88062","id":"C88062","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professional","id":"professional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/respect","id":"respect"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/impressed","id":"impressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/trust","id":"Trust"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/753336","id":"753336"}]},{"id":749567,"author":"DJOHNV","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Recent emergency admission","body":"Visited GP with Pains in my chest who prompty medicated me with Asprin and Nitroglycerin spray as suspected a heart attack.
