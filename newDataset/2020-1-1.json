I received a call back from a Dr, not my regular DR as requested.  But a male I found rude, dismissive and bullying. He frequently spoke over me, would let me explain my symptoms and proceeded to tell me I should have used the online consultation to save time. Well I did some 2 weeks later Re different symptoms and generally feeling unwell, guess what, no response...... I really wish the practice I had been with hadn’t merged with this new one, the staff have no people skills, their cold and dismissive, why can’t I call and get through in the phone, surely dealing with peoples health worries warrants a discussion not feeling in an online form and why no response to filling in and sending the firm.

My fiancé had called the midwives and asked when we should make a move and make our way to the centre, and we was advised to come in to get a check up to see how things were coming along as my contractions where very frequent. As I arrived the contractions got worse, and they where more frequently. This is where (in my opinion) the clinic went wrong. As I was getting assessed by a midwife I was told that I was 3-4 cm dilated, and this is usually around the time that I would be admitted. The midwife then asked me if I wanted to stay and be admitted or go back home where I can be more comfortable and wait a little longer and return when labour was more active. I told the midwife that I would like to stay and be admitted as I was in a lot of pain, and knew my baby was on the way, so going home and making my way back would only delay things and make me more stressed out and scared. I thought I was given a choice seeing as I was asked what I would like to choose to do, however the midwife had left the room, spoke to her manager, and came back to me, and told me that they think I should go home and come back later. I do not understand why I was asked just to be told what to do. What is even worse, is the fact that the reason why I was sent home was due to me not “looking like” I was having the type of painful contractions that indicated I was in active labour, so they assumed I would be fit to go home as I was probably exaggerating my contractions seeing as this was my first baby and I didn’t know anything. Needless to say my water broke in the car on the way home, I had to turn around and return, and I gave birth to my baby an hour later! I can’t fault the midwife I was assigned when I arrived back, she was very caring, made me feel super comfortable and helped me immensely during and after labour. However, the same midwife that told me to go home and who wrote the reason for this decision in my notes was that I didn’t “look like I was in active labour“, was the exact same midwife who gave me a tour of the clinic earlier on in my pregnancy, in which she explained their procedures yet failed to follow through when it came to my situation. I understand that many pregnant women deal with labour pain differently, some women feel to express their pain vocally and I totally understand that, yet when I was trying to keep calm and contain myself I didn’t “look like I was in active labour”. This ruined my experience at the practice sadly, I was very stressed out and scared as I returned back to the clinic to have my baby, I didn’t have time to get undressed, or even get settled properly. It was all a rush due to the midwife who assessed me. If a woman says her baby is coming, then believe her that her baby is coming! She will know, whether it’s her first baby or not!

I contacted them when I was in a crisis on Saturday.  \r\nI am under St. Helens recovery team and they only work week days until 5pm so out of hours I have been told to ring the home treatment team should I be in a crisis.  \r\nI rang them approximately 10.30am where a lady answered and after me asking would it be possible for someone to come out and see me today she asked why. I can’t discuss much in my home environment therefore I just explained that I don’t feel safe and have urges to end my life but I want to prove that I am wanting help and reaching out.  \r\nShe got my details up on their computer and said -oh yes I recognise your name. We are not a crisis service and you can’t just expect us to drop everything and fit you in when our staff have appointments booked in.  \r\nThis made me feel so guilty for even ringing and for reaching out for help. I was then questioning why I even rang them. I told them -I’ve been told by my care coordinator to contact you should I be in crisis and the home treatment team know me’-she raised her voice and now was shouting at me very abrupt saying -you have to have have been referred by your care coordinator and because you are not under us we won’t be coming out to see you.  \r\nI felt completely hopeless and the urges were so much stronger. I had also only been out of an inpatient unit just short of a week when this took place.  \r\nI then found myself crying to this lady on the phone begging her for help. She then said we might be able to send someone out at 12 but we might not. If you get a call in between now and 12 then it’s to say we can’t see you but if you don’t someone will be put’.  \r\nI was very greatful to have someone possibly coming out but I still felt like such an inconvenience and a burden on everyone which was due to how I was spoken too in a moment of crisis.  \r\n12 o’clock came, then 12.30 then 1pm and still nobody had turned up to see me and I had no phone call. I am an extremely anxious person so waiting for someone heightens these feelings which home treatment know. I also understand there is sometimes a perfectly reasonable explanation as to why they are late such as they had a crisis at their last appointment or the traffic etc.  \r\nI rang home treatment team just to see if someone was still coming and they said we have no idea why nobody hasn’t turned up yet give them a bit longer which I did and still nobody was here. Due to my anxiety I rang again and cancelled the call out because i was getting extremely worked up and distressed just sat waiting and watching for them from a window. They never batted an eyelid at the fact I said I was suicidal and was so distressed over the phone and was happy for me to be left.  \r\nThis isn’t the first time something like this has happened with St. Helens home treatment team and now I have completely lost all trust in them and probably wouldn’t contact them out of hours now should I find myself in another crisis. They made me feel so invalid and worthless. No service or professional should make you worse and be so inconsiderate at a time of desperation.","criticality":"strongly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2019-12-30T10:57:43.2866667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-01-01T11:04:10.267","readBy":[{"name":"North West Boroughs Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/721069","id":"721069"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/721069/responses","id":"721069"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/721069/healthservices","id":"721069"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/721069/tags","id":"721069"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rtv","id":"RTV","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxious","id":"anxious"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/crisis","id":"crisis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hopeless","id":"Hopeless"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/inconvenience","id":"inconvenience"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20listened%20to","id":"not listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/burden","id":"burden"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/distressed","id":"distressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/felt%20ignored","id":"felt ignored"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/rude%20staff","id":"rude staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/suicidal","id":"suicidal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unworthy","id":"unworthy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/inconsistent","id":"inconsistent"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/like%20an%20inconvenience","id":"like an inconvenience"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/spoken%20over","id":"spoken over"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/felt%20unsafe","id":"felt unsafe"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/732789","id":"732789"}]},{"id":721444,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Still waiting for an appointment","body":"My husband was having treatment for his Glaucoma - his last appointment was not held as there were too many people waiting for treatment.

Their kindness, compassion along with their knowledge will never be forgotten. They took the time to explain to my husband and I the concerns they had regarding our daughter and how they were dealing with this in the immediate and long term.  \r\nDuring our stay in the unit we were never made to feel as if we were occupying too much of the nurses time with our questions or concerns.  \r\nThe doctors and nurses spent significant time with us explaining our daughters condition along with treatment plan. They were sympathetic to our worries and also to our emotional state with one child in neonatal and 2 children at home.  \r\nDr Cox along with Consultant Dr Munro provided detailed explanations of our daughters condition and never at any point rushed us. They were both informative but sensitive to the emotions of a new mum.  \r\nDuring our time in the unit we experienced kindness and compassion at all times. Until last week we have never had any experience of the unit. In all honesty, it's a placed where you wish you will never need the services but should you ever be in a position that they are required, the team within the unit are the best you could ever hope for.  \r\nThere are a number of inidivudals with whom we were in contact with during the 5 days who provided exceptional service.That said, anyone we came in contact with treated us with the same care, attention and compassion and we couldn't be more grateful.  \r\nGrace - new to the unit but her compassion with parents will serve her well in the unit.  \r\nWe can't thank the team at Aberdeen Neonatal enough.

My main concern was for the nurses, they were doing a lot of hard work, changing bedsheets, generally running back and forth and caring for all the patients.  Even taking those who could to have showers and to wash our hair. The lady who came in each day to help the nurses was lovely, always \nhad a smile, but quietly got on with her job.  The lady with the tea trolley also was smiley and had kind words for everyone.\nTHANK YOU ALL SO MUCH.\nI am making good progress.  I am just sorry it has taken me a while to thank you all.

I had to wait until 6.30 pm before I could call 111 and was seen out of hours. My son drove me there. I was told that I had crackling in right lung indicative of a chest infection and given antibiotics.  I have now developed pain on my right side.  Kept me awake last night.   So phoned surgery.  Just wanted advice.  Oh no.  Nothing and nobody available.  Told that if I come to surgery tomorrow morning at 8 I can make an appointment or phone (by the time you get through appointment tend to be gone).  I pointed out to the receptionist that I was feeling too fatigued to do this.  That I had eaten around 6 dry biscuits and one tin of soup in the past 3 days.

On one occasion after he had suggested I have a precautionary blood test, I received a text from him the following morning at 9 am to say that the results were normal, thus making all the difference to my Xmas! On another occasion the medication I was prescribed proved to be very effective. I would therefore like to say what a very valuable service I think the duty doctor system is and to express my warmest thanks to the doctors I have spoken to.

I was in a room with one other mother who was post natal and 2 women who were still pregnant.  \r\nThis was a very upsetting time for my husband and I during the time our daughter was being cared for in the neonatal unit (which is at the other end of the maternity hospital from Summerfield ward). I would say that care is needed for mothers who are separated from their babies in the neonatal unit. Often post natal checks were missed because of the amount of time spent out of the ward and in the neonatal unit and on some evenings I came and went from the ward without any communication at all. Save for the last two days on the ward, i felt very isolated during my time on Summerfield Ward. During my time in the hospital, I spent very little time in Summerfield ward as I was at the neonatal unit sitting with our poorly daughter, returning only to the ward to express milk for my daughter and to sleep. On the 4th night my daughter returned to the ward with me and the midwives did everything they could to expedite my discharge from the hospital. Unfortunately by this stage I had developed an infection and it looked likely that I may not be able to return home for Christmas. The midwives mentioned below worked with the doctors to help get me home with the rest of my family by giving IV antibiotics for 18 hours followed by oral antibiotics for 6 days at home. Nicola Forster, Sarah and Hannah all worked so hard to get my daughter and I home for Christmas and we are so grateful for their kindness and compassion during a difficult time when I was separated from my daughter in the unit and also from my children at home. There was an individual who was less than helpful during my time on the ward but this has been dealt with on a separate complaint.","criticality":"minimally critical","dateOfSubmission":"2019-12-31T22:22:56.6066667","progress":"Change planned","dateOfPublication":"2020-01-02T11:44:27.55","readBy":[{"name":"Scottish Government","count":2},{"name":"NHS Grampian","count":4},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/721409","id":"721409"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/721409/responses","id":"721409"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/721409/healthservices","id":"721409"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/721409/tags","id":"721409"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/n161h_422","id":"N161H_422","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/n161h_501","id":"N161H_501","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/isolated","id":"isolated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/maternity","id":"maternity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/midwives","id":"midwives"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/neonatal","id":"neonatal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassion","id":"compassion"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/728541","id":"728541"}]},{"id":721570,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Uncontactable!","body":"Self Referred to the York IAPT service on the advice of my GP. \nI received a voicemail a couple of days later asking me to get in touch for a telephone assessment.

One of the visitors told me she had been like that for over 2 hours. She couldn't eat her dinner because of pain and they came back and took her dinner away. I also noticed her pyjamas were different trousers than her top. Her pyjama trousers were lying on the bottom of bed rolled up in a ball and soaking wet as she had had an accident. I had to lift them and put them in my bag.  \r\nI went to a nurse who said she already had her pain killers, I asked mum and she said she hadn't so I went back to another nurse who said she will find out if she had or not. On returning to us i was told another nurse had lifted the pain killers off the floor and put them in the bin. So why not give her more ?

I live many miles away, so I needed to call to find out how she was bearing up. I am her next of kin. The staff in A&E (majors) and Kerensa were really helpful. They were very busy, but still found time to give me proper information on her state of health and give her excellent care. When she began to improve, their wonderful activity team were brilliant in helping her engage with day to day life each day. A much better option than leaving patients to just sit or lie in bed. When she moved to a community hospital to continue her care, they fully informed me of when, where, and what procedures were in place.  \r\nContrast this with the community hospital that she went to to convalesce. Whilst she was well looked after, they could not give better information than ‘she’s fine’ or ‘same as yesterday’. She is also being discharged and her care package does not start till the day after she arrives home. She does get some lunch and some meds, but the person who advised me of the discharge couldn’t confirm what arrangements actually were in place as she had not checked them yet. This is disturbing as this is not what you want to hear when someone who is nearly 93 is sent home on her own.  \r\nPeople always bash busy hospitals, but I feel that the contrast between Royal Cornwall and some of the others is rather dramatic.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-01-01T21:19:39.4833333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-01-02T12:37:32.4","readBy":[{"name":"Royal Cornwall Hospitals NHS Trust","count":7}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/721475","id":"721475"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/721475/responses","id":"721475"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/721475/healthservices","id":"721475"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/721475/tags","id":"721475"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/ref12_180","id":"REF12_180","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/well%20looked%20after","id":"well looked after"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wonderful","id":"wonderful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/activity%20team","id":"activity team"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/721618","id":"721618"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/729068","id":"729068"}]},{"id":721476,"author":"Renal unit","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"A staff nurse in the renal unit saved my life","body":"After a very serious illness staff nurse Tanya in the renal unit in my opinion saved my life.

We entered the reception area where about 16 people were sitting, possibly only half were customers. I explained that I woke up on Christmas day, 25th with a numbness down one side of my body from the top of my head to my foot. After a whole day I felt that the problem had not gone away and although I was in no pain my wife drove me to the hospital ignoring the 24 call out on line which states I should have called an ambulance.  \r\nWithin 5 minutes a nurse called me and I was taken through to be examined in a booth. He was of the opinion I had had a stroke. As my blood pressure was high I was asked to lie on the special trolleys and that a stroke doctor and nurse will be to see me soon. A stroke nurse checked me out, a nurse related to heart conditions checked my heart and the Doctor specializing in strokes came. She booked me in for a Scan on my head. I was then moved to the TIA ward and assigned a bed. All happened within a few hours. Once again I went through tests by nurses and the on duty doctor. The next morning after breakfast, yummy,I went for an ultrascan of my neck. all tests showed my brain to be okay. I was later discharged that day and informed that They would book me in for a MRI scan in a few weeks. I still have the symptoms but not as bad, have been given medication to take at home.  \r\nCan I say that the staff at the hospital were fantastic, attentive and caring all done with a smile.

I then was sent off to wait and another nurse took some other observations including an ECG.It was now 2am and she told me the Dr would see me next.I waited but by 3 I queried this and she said they were very busy so I wondered why she had said I was next.I then waited another 2 hours to 5am to see the Dr.She seemed thorough except at the end she went to sort out a CT scan to check I wasn’t bleeding internally,telling me to wait alone in the room and that she would only be a minute.An hour later she had not returned so I asked nurses outside if they knew where she was,they didn’t,nor do I think they knew I was in the room.After now being alone there for over 6 hours I’d had enough and told a nurse I was leaving.She wasn’t bothered.I rarely use your A&E but every time it's a nightmare,mostly because of what chaos it has become but also the apparent lack of caring in most of the staff.Whilst writing this review I have received a 'Courtesy Call' from your trust about my experience which I would not take part in because giving my details to a stranger who calls me on a unknown number sounds like number one in how to get scammed.If it is genuine you would be better putting money into your on the ground resources than a call centre PR exercise.\n","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-01-02T13:33:33","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-01-02T13:38:20","readBy":[{"name":"Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/721602","id":"721602"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/721602/responses","id":"721602"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/721602/healthservices","id":"721602"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/721602/tags","id":"721602"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/ral26","id":"RAL26","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/worried","id":"worried"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/alone","id":"alone"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/arm","id":"arm"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back%20pain","id":"back pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bleeding","id":"bleeding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood","id":"blood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20pressure","id":"blood pressure"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breathing","id":"breathing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/chest","id":"chest"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/chest%20pain","id":"chest pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ct","id":"ct"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ct%20scan","id":"CT scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/difficulty%20walking","id":"difficulty walking"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ecg","id":"ecg"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/encouraged","id":"encouraged"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/exercise","id":"exercise"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/heart","id":"heart"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain%20on%20walking","id":"pain on walking"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scan","id":"scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/terrible","id":"terrible"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/872869","id":"872869"}]},{"id":721478,"author":"jmare33","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"My visit to Emergency at Borders Generak Hospital, Melrose, Scotland","body":"As a visitor to Scotland from Australia, I went to the Emergency Department of Borders General Hospital, Melrose in November last year suffering acute pain in chest.  \r\nThe treatment I received in this Emergency Department was absolutely brilliant and first class, and I would like to take this opportunity to commend the hospital and some of the practitioners who treated me on this visit.  \r\nFirstly, Dr Nick Ord was extraordinarily attentive, thorough and compassionate in treating me upon arrival.
