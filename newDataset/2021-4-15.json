During Covid I had telephone appointments with him and as my right knee is now painful he made me a face to face appointment to ascertain whether I need it replacing, which he thinks I do. Also my left kneecap is arthritic so he is keeping his eye on that too.

BUT... And here’s the important part... All of the doctors, nurses and healthcare professionals at Newlands Medical Centre have a genuine level of care for their patients; I have found them incredibly approachable, diligent and many even go above and beyond to support. The team at Newlands Medical Centre have supported me to realise that having multiple and complex healthcare needs isn’t me being a burden; that actually there are things I can do to better my health and well-being and that no question is a silly question. The team work incredibly hard and it saddens me to see that they only have 2 stars. I very rarely would give 5 stars on a review because I’m of the school of thought that we can all do better, but the way the surgery has continued to support patients over the past year has been exemplary!

I then waited in a hot unventilated corridor for an unsympathetic, unapologetic team to offer me reassurance that never came.  \r\nI have 3 children and this was without a doubt the worst care I have received in hospital and during a pandemic I would expect more in terms of safety, privacy and dignity.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-04-13T10:57:58.41","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-04-15T11:03:24.69","readBy":[{"name":"Frimley Health NHS Foundation Trust","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/838711","id":"838711"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/838711/responses","id":"838711"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/838711/healthservices","id":"838711"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/838711/tags","id":"838711"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rdu01_502","id":"RDU01_502","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20upset","id":"very upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bleed","id":"bleed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood","id":"blood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/maternity","id":"maternity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/panic","id":"panic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/privacy","id":"privacy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassurance","id":"reassurance"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scan","id":"scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unfriendly","id":"unfriendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/walk","id":"walk"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dignity","id":"Dignity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20relations","id":"staff relations"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/social%20distancing","id":"social distancing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%20safety","id":"covid safety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/early%20pregnancy%20unit","id":"early pregnancy unit"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/844469","id":"844469"}]},{"id":839333,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Unprofessional staff","body":"Receptionist turned us away saying we got no appointment booked for blood test then another lady phoned us by 4pm saying she was waiting for us since 2o clock.

He listened my son’s chest, it sounded fine for him,checked  \r\nthe x-ray my son had it 4 days before, he said all  \r\ngood, everything looked  \r\ngood for  \r\nhim, he said  \r\nhe cannot see a shadow and lungs are looking as they should for a child his age. So  \r\nas he could not identify any physical problem  \r\nhe said we deal  \r\nnow with a child with anxiety attacks and to  \r\nrefer my child  \r\nto children’s mental health department. i  \r\nwondered why , how  \r\nand why my son would  \r\nhave these attacks? i asked as i was really confused why one doctor said 4 days ago that had the chest infection and he s got another opinion. he answered the child  \r\nis fine and easily can say he has anxiety attacks. i asked why he had the antibiotics for and what should i do. he recommended to  \r\ninterrupt the treatment the next day and look at the other problem and he said “ i cant say what happened 4 days ago”. i left and next day we started again with the same problem. i  \r\nhave contacted our local  \r\ngps and i  \r\nasked for advice as i was totally confused. as these days there are not face to face appointments  \r\nwith the gps i  \r\nhad a phone call appointment with one of our gp. without asking to  \r\nactually see my son for another examination and following my description of symptoms he could not make it clear for  \r\nme, he said he does not have access to a&e files and he thought the same  \r\ni should refer him  \r\nto children’s  \r\nmental health. days went past and things are still not clear for  \r\nme, did he have a chest infection or panic attacks?He feels better blessed him  \r\nstill accusing time to time shortness of breathing and pressure on his chest.

communication","body":"I strongly feel that as they did not know me I was pre judged. I had met one amazing receptionist who was excellent in her role. This receptionist will never realise the standard they set for their colleagues, their empathetic and caring nature was very clear when I rang and explained I was in a mental health crisis.  \r\nAlongside this in the upcoming weeks while I was waiting for a follow up from the CMHT, this person offered support and explained who I could contact to escalate my concerns. Unfortunately, their colleagues did not demonstrate the same core values and if they had them, they have had ample opportunities to show them but failed.  \r\nAs new medication had been given and it started to settle I knew that I still needed medical help and that I wasn't ok yet, I had rang and asked for a call with the Dr or an appointment and was told to expect a phone call that phone call shortly after two- this never happened and when I rang again I was told that they had forgotten to put it on the list. I appreciate honesty and I had no issue with that as we are only human and are working in strange and unpredictable times.  \r\nThe Doctor did then give me a call and instead of confirming the truth told me that they wouldn't be making the phone call until 17: 20 anyway- I explained that the receptionist had already explained the truth to which then the doctor confessed. A week later I had booked for a smear and I was shocked when I was met with a sit down and I will take your blood pressure- no introduction no how are you? I asked for the name before the procedure started and told them I myself was a nurse there was no communication- while getting dressed a colleagues walked into the room and thankfully the curtain had been closed over.  \r\nI could see on their computer that they were able to see my medical records and I truthfully felt like I was being judged for having the illness I do and if this was not the case where was her person centred care? I work in healthcare as I have said, I do believe that each patient has a voice and that is why I am giving this care opinion for learning opportunities. Communication is at the core of everything we do, it is core to the care provided. I never in my wildest dreams expected to have the health issues I currently have and to feel this way has made my nervous and anxious to ring and ask for help.  \r\nI am very aware that mental health is hard and its hard to help patients who are suffering and see no way of improvement and I know that the Dr. on my case has done everything correctly so I thank them for that. Maine medical is a beautiful practice and I have not had the full opportunity of meeting everybody so I do hope that this is not seen as a negative for all reading this but instead only a reminder that honest, caring communication is key to good patient outcomes.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-04-09T12:33:49.77","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2021-04-15T12:20:00.81","readBy":[{"name":"Ulster University, MBBS (Medicine) 2021","count":1},{"name":"Public Health Agency","count":3}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/837827","id":"837827"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/837827/responses","id":"837827"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/837827/healthservices","id":"837827"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/837827/tags","id":"837827"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/nigp-pn4155","id":"nigp-pn4155","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxious","id":"anxious"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/shocked","id":"shocked"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood","id":"blood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20pressure","id":"blood pressure"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/call%20back","id":"call back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/forgotten","id":"forgotten"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/judged","id":"judged"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20good","id":"not good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/receptionist","id":"receptionist"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20introduction","id":"staff introduction"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/empathetic","id":"empathetic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health%20crisis","id":"mental health crisis"}]},{"id":839356,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Careful, thorough and friendly","body":"I arrived at 8.05 am and was seen by the Nurse within 15 minutes.

Last week on Monday 5th April I was admitted to be induced to Ward 31A at RAH Paisley. Induction failed, and it was decided I would go for a c section on 7th April. I was in my own room at this point and the every midwife that came in were always so lovely and caring.  \r\nWhen going down for my c section, emotions took over and I was extremely nervous. The midwives in recovery were absolutely amazing with me, reassuring me and calming me down. I wish I caught their names because I can’t thank them about for being there for me whilst my partner was on route. I would like to say a special thank you to Paul. He guided me through my c section and made the atmosphere so positive. If it wasn’t for Paul, I would never have been so calm. Paul, you are so amazing at your job and I would like to thank you for helping to bring my baby girl in to this world. You brought humour and made me laugh at I time I never thought I would.  \r\nThe care in recovery afterwards was second to none. I was then moved back to Ward 31A. Again, the care I received was absolutely outstanding and every midwife was happy to help and never made you feel like you were annoying them by pressing your buzzer. Laura helped me for 2 days in a row, and she was amazing. There were a couple of other midwives who helped me and I didn’t catch their names, all lovely nurturing people. I have now been home for 3 days and have been reflecting on my experience. I hope the midwives get to see my thanks, as they have no idea how much I appreciate their help. Although it is their job, they have a huge impact on people’s lives and I will never forget my amazing experience.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-04-13T08:38:44.0233333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-04-15T12:45:22.04","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":8}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/838685","id":"838685"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/838685/responses","id":"838685"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/838685/healthservices","id":"838685"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/838685/tags","id":"838685"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/c418h_100","id":"C418H_100","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/c418h-matcare1","id":"c418h-matcare1","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nervous","id":"nervous"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/birth","id":"birth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/c%20section","id":"c section"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/caring","id":"caring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helped","id":"helped"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helpful","id":"helpful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/humour","id":"humour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/induction","id":"induction"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lovely","id":"lovely"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/midwives","id":"midwives"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/outstanding","id":"Outstanding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/positive","id":"positive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/section","id":"section"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing","id":"amazing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/calm","id":"calm"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20for","id":"cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happy","id":"happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassuring","id":"reassuring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thankful","id":"Thankful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thanks","id":"thanks"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/caesarean%20section","id":"caesarean section"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/840153","id":"840153"}]},{"id":839365,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Room For Improvement","body":"After waiting on the phone 45 minutes the recptionist answered and then proceeded to blast me with information - how to request a repeat  prescription via a complicated email address and then told me the phone number for the blood clinic (telephone number) to book my blood test.

After waiting 3.5hrs at the centre I was seen by a nurse who asked if I was referred to them by my surgery, she was not surprised to hear that I had been and said that 90% of patients today were referrals from surgeries. Which begs the question, what patients are the surgeries accepting? After a short examination I was told to increase my dosage of medicine. On Monday 12th I was no better stoll unable to breath normally and decided to drive to my surgery and asked to see a doctor, as I was really struggling to breath and had been for almost a week. I was told to fill out a form online, I said that I needed to see a doctor today and was promised that once I submitted an online form I would be able to see a doctor. Two hours after submitting my form I received a message that a doctor would call me on Friday 16th sometime during surgery hours. I hardly visit the surgery and usually only when its Asthma related.

Our local hospital is south tyneside and we have always had excellent treatment there. Most recently my wife had a fall a few weeks ago and was in south tyneside for a few hours.  \r\nWhat a difference in the standards of care we received between the 2 departments. My wife advised nothing is too much trouble for the staff at south tyneside, on her last visit she was given something to eat, regular hot drinks and staff were friendly, chatty and funny, including her in conversations and making her at ease with the situation. Waiting times were explained to her by the nurse in charge who was funny and extremely down to earth. My wife advised nothing was an issue for them and if she needed the toilet, her needs were attended to as quickly as possible.  \r\nOn attending Sunderland royal she was dumped in a room and left for several hours waiting to be seen. She said the nurses were dour, constantly complaining about how busy they were and abrupt. Bloods were taken by a nurse who didn’t wear gloves or wash their hands.She asked for assistance to the toilet and was ignored. She asked for a glass of water and was ignored. She had her scan and then had a 5 minute discussion with a doctor who said she could go. Blood results were not discussed or explained. My wife said it was like the doctor wanted her out of there as quickly as possible. My wife left after 5 hours and wasn’t given anything to eat or drink despite being diabetic. She asked for assistance to the toilet and was ignored. The journey home was awful for her as she was desperate for the toilet l. The indignity is appalling.  \r\nWe both wish instead of going to sunderland, which was the nearest hospital when she had her fall, that we had travelled to south tyneside. Both departments were busy at the time she attended. Yet the standard of care we received was vastly different.  \r\nThe staff at Sunderland hospital did not show enough empathy and compassion. Well done south tyneside. Sunderland - hang your heads in shame.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-04-13T08:52:03.79","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-04-15T14:32:34.83","readBy":[{"name":"South Tyneside and Sunderland NHS Foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/838687","id":"838687"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/838687/responses","id":"838687"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/838687/healthservices","id":"838687"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/838687/tags","id":"838687"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/r0b01_180","id":"R0B01_180","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/r0b0q_180","id":"R0B0Q_180","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appalling","id":"appalling"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ignored","id":"ignored"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood","id":"blood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/chatty","id":"chatty"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cleanliness","id":"cleanliness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/desperate","id":"desperate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diabetic","id":"diabetic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency","id":"emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/excellent%20treatment","id":"excellent treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/humour","id":"humour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scan","id":"scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attitude","id":"staff attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/undignified","id":"undignified"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassion","id":"compassion"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/explanations","id":"explanations"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/access%20to%20water","id":"access to water"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/access%20to%20food","id":"access to food"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/840177","id":"840177"}]},{"id":839395,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Efficient Practice","body":"I have been with this GP for the last 3 years and despite not requiring alot of GP appointments, the few times me and my partner have used them - we have had quick and efficient responses - the nurses particularly have been helpful.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2021-04-15T12:35:27","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-04-15T14:32:42","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/839395","id":"839395"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/839395/responses","id":"839395"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/839395/healthservices","id":"839395"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/839395/tags","id":"839395"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/f86074","id":"F86074","score":null},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/840350","id":"840350"}]},{"id":839389,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Fantastic","body":"I had oral surgery but the became concerned about a skin lesion in a different area!

You were gracious enough to publish my story.  \r\nIn an emergency situation, it became necessary for me to be re-admitted to hospital last week - this time to Victoria Hospital in Kirkcaldy. The ambulance drivers, Angela and Dave, were supportive, friendly and totally committed.  \r\nAll the staff whom I met over four days, were so professional and caring. Being a second invasive operation for me in three days, I was somewhat apprehensive, but the nursing staff (and I must have met a couple of dozen) were very reassuring and the theatre staff, the Anaesthetists, the Urology Consultant demonstrated the outstanding service being provided by NHS Fife.  \r\nNaming individuals can be invidious especially when there are teams at work, but I trust that all those working with Siobhan, Kath, Ellie, Morgan and Mr al Jaafari will accept reflected glory.  \r\nHowever, I have to make a special mention of Dr Ayers who performed my prostatectomy. From the moment that she took time to describe the procedure pre-op, to the time going into theatre, to her post-op attention on subsequent days, she exuded confidence and warmth, and made a lasting and indelible impression upon me. Not only does she have the intelligence and huge talent to become eminently successful (she is already well on her way) in her chosen profession, but she has, in spades, what many albeit able people, lack - namely communication skills and an open and friendly personality and demeanor which clearly endears her to patients. A real indicator is that the nursing staff all talked fondly of Dr Ayers. NHS Fife should be aware of the gem that it has in that young lady!  \r\nTwo Fife hospitals for me within a short period : even in these difficult times, both showed the resolve and professionalism of their staff. It is all too easy to moan and be negative, but the powers to be should appreciate and recognise just what they have, from not only highly talented doctors but also totally dedicated nursing staff, many of whom would describe themselves as just ordinary people. Far from ordinary, in my opinion!  \r\n","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-04-13T13:17:52.5133333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-04-15T15:27:00.637","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Fife","count":12},{"name":"Fife Health & Social Care Partnership","count":3}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/838732","id":"838732"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/838732/responses","id":"838732"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/838732/healthservices","id":"838732"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/838732/tags","id":"838732"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/f704h_101","id":"F704H_101","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sf9","id":"SF9","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ambulance%20care","id":"Ambulance care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dedication","id":"dedication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency","id":"emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/operation","id":"operation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professionalism","id":"professionalism"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supportive","id":"supportive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/urology","id":"urology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confidence","id":"confidence"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happy","id":"happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassuring","id":"reassuring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/trust","id":"Trust"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/team%20professional","id":"team professional"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/840062","id":"840062"}]},{"id":838754,"author":"waterbj56","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Covid vaccine at SSE","body":"Absolutely amazed by the guys at the SSE from staff in the car park directing cars to park, guys at the front door ensuring people are wearing masks and sanatising hands.\r\nHad a lovely girl who took my details and checked my ID.

It was a shock for our family when she became poorly on Sunday and we had to call the ambulance service.  \r\nAs usual the paramedic attended first and was fantastic, the call handlers from the Ambulance Service were calm and excellent and the 2 Ambulance officers were also a credit to the NHS. We felt reassured and not overly alarmed that we would not be allowed to be with her as we knew she would be looked after. After not too many hours in A&E she was admitted to a stroke Ward in the Ulster Hospital. We were allowed a quick visit that night and then afterward only one visit, for one hour, once a week. Of course we understood but were worried about her not seeing us or fully understanding why and we too would be comforted by visiting her.  \r\nI found out about Virtual visiting when i visited on Wednesday 7th April and we set up Virtual Visiting which was organised by two wonderful ladies in the team. It was done via Zoom and booking was so simple. I received an email with the zoom link and i shared with other members of our family. Lisa brought a tablet to Mum's ward, logged on and we all were able to see our Mum, laugh and chat to her and I know that both she and we were really happy to see each other.  \r\nIt is a wonderful service and whilst can never replace the face to face visiting, in circumstances such as this or for families who may live some distance away or cannot attend due to their own health issues, etc the Virtual Visiting is definitely something that think we would definitely wish to avail of and keep using.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-04-14T07:05:50.79","progress":"Story has

Yes it is difficult to get through on the phone lines, you may need to wait up to an hour but my advice would be put your phone on loudspeaker, grab a cup of tea and relax or (put a load of washing on) and keep at it. The receptionists are ok( some more polite than others; maybe apologise for the long wait first before asking what the patient’s problem is and a caring tone to an ill person makes them feel better especially after the tension of waiting for the phone to be answered). The doctors are friendly, apologetic and caring. They listen carefully and give importance to what’s been said as well as getting the right treatment, resolving issues in referrals and ensuring we go back if the problem escalates. They are respectful and patient even if patient is old or suffering from mental health issues. This is a difficult time, hopefully the waiting times on the phone get shorter, but don’t let it put you off from seeking treatment. Other surgeries also have similar phoning in times and waits, but doctors/ midwives who are not as caring.
