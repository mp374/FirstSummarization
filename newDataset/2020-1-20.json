They said that the surgery had inappropriately referred me and I could try NEMS. I have never been to NEMS before but decided to go in and ask the waiting time.  \r\nThere was one trained nurse on the reception desk but when I tried to ask the question, as they didn't listen to me they barked inappropriate questions at me (thinking I was a relative). I said I had my urgent referral letter and I was a patient and they barked at me to sit down, saying they were busy doing something, then vanished leaving no staff there.  \r\nI waited a short while and decided I didn't like the tone of the department if that was a snapshot of it and there seemed to be a few waiting so I left. As I went to push open the door who should be pulling it open but the rude nurse, as a patient/member of the public did they hold it open for me? No, they pushed through and never even acknowledged me.  \r\nI can appreciate a busy department but I can't appreciate rude staff, they choose to work there at the end of the day. They might have been having a bad day but did they know about mine?","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-01-14T11:17:37.3733333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-01-20T09:20:01.343","readBy":[{"name":"NEMS Community Benefit Services Limited","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/730642","id":"730642"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/730642/responses","id":"730642"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/730642/healthservices","id":"730642"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/730642/tags","id":"730642"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/1-345290116","id":"1-345290116","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/annoyed","id":"annoyed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cannot%20be%20bothered","id":"cannot be bothered"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/embarrassed","id":"embarrassed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ignored","id":"ignored"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/should%20listen","id":"Should listen"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/eye","id":"eye"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendliness%20of%20staff","id":"friendliness of staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/need%20help","id":"need help"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/patient%20privacy","id":"Patient privacy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/under%20valued","id":"under valued"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/732791","id":"732791"}]},{"id":731984,"author":"Sunshine2627","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Mixed care","body":"I had an early scan in December which revealed that I had a missed miscarriage.

The Midwive who I was under the care of that day didn't have much empathy considering what I was going through. I felt I was more a number than a patient.  \r\nA couple of days later I was admitted yet again to Rubislaw ward with a suspected womb infection which was terrifying and was utterly traumatic after just what happened a couple of days before this.  \r\nI have to tell you that the Midwife who looked after me that evening was absolutely amazing, she was so supportive, understanding and actually looked after me. I felt like an actual patient.  \r\nI didn't catch her name but would be grateful if you could find out and let her know that she is a credit to the ward and so so lovely. I have to say with all the times I've been to the Maternity Hospital (having 2 healthy pregnancies previously) that evening I was in for an overnight stay in Rubislaw was the best I've been cared for.  \r\nSo would like to say thank you to that amazing Midwife who made an awful situation a little easier.

First to ward 41 and later to ward 43. Throughout the experience, I found it almost impossible to get any information from staff despite being a next of kin and also having Power of Attorney for him. I knew he had a UTI as his care home had given me this information and this was not unusual for him due to long term use of a catheter. We went all over the christmas period not really knowing if this was something to worry about or not. Visiting is not an easy option as it is a 40 mile trip and of no real benefit to my uncle as he no longer recognises family. However, this seemed our only option when by the 29th December we had still received no real information and much of the time there was no answer to our calls. I had even rung the PALS office for help and they had promised that someone would call me back. I'm still waiting for that call!!  \r\nMy sister and I visited at the end of the month and were shocked at the change in him from only a week before. He had been walking about, chatting and feeding himself and now he was doing none of that and a chat with a staff member revealed that they were talking about end of life care. Why had no one spoken to the family? They led us to believe that someone would talk to us about this but again no call  \r\nA further visit by my sister seemed to contradict this information and we were just left confused'  \r\nAgain no call from them but I found that he was to be discharged back to the care home. The staff there were just as shocked as we had been to see the deterioration in him. After only a few hours there he had to be sent back to the hospital as he had been returned without a catheter even though his discharge notes said one was fitted. He then spent all night in A&E before a bed was found for him on ward 41. Still there a number of days later so it does raise the question of should he have been sent out.  \r\nA visit also revealed that not only had he been released without a catheter fitted but he had been released with an end of life care plan which said he should not be sent back to hospital.  \r\nMy sister and myself had left a copy of our power of attorney and expressed our wish to be involved in any decisions but this had obviously been ignored and this decision was made without our consultation.  \r\nI am distressed at them releasing my uncle only for him to be returned a few hours later and I am further upset at the lack of communication and compassion we have received from the hospital. I can only hope that communication and care are better than they have been so far.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-01-07T08:32:24.41","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-01-20T09:57:57.59","readBy":[{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2020)","count":1},{"name":"Mid Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/728692","id":"728692"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/728692/responses","id":"728692"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/728692/healthservices","id":"728692"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/728692/tags","id":"728692"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rxf05_430","id":"RXF05_430","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confused","id":"confused"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ignored","id":"ignored"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lack%20of%20care","id":"Lack of care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/shocked","id":"shocked"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/broken%20promises","id":"broken promises"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care%20plan","id":"care plan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dementia","id":"dementia"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/distressed","id":"distressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/end%20of%20life","id":"end of life"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/family%20contact","id":"Family contact"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kept%20informed","id":"kept informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pals.","id":"PALS."},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassion","id":"compassion"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/conflicting%20information","id":"conflicting information"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/732951","id":"732951"}]},{"id":732385,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Great practice ","body":"Visited this evening , all the staff were very helpful and organised .

It would seem that a pre-requisite to working in the maternity services is that you have to be a saint! We were induced on Ward 17 and did a lot of labouring there in the first instance. The staff were attentive and compassionate, doing everything they could to ensure that we were as comfortable and happy as two first time parents experiencing labour can be! We were then transferred to the labour suite where Louise looked after us with such humanity that my husband still finds it hard to talk about without tearing up. We were allowed to make the labour room our own with battery-operated tea lights and music. Every step of the labouring process was talked through with us and we felt totally empowered throughout. After an expertly administered epidural I was even able to almost enjoy the experience! After a lack of progress we were advised by Dr. Rigby that a caesarean was the best option and, within a couple of hours, we were in theatre. The theatre staff were chatty and jovial and completely put us at ease in an alien situation. Maxine, the anaesthetist, talked us through every step and was very attentive. Again, we were allowed to make the theatre our own with our own choice of music. After our son was born were transferred back to Ward 17. The staff on the ward were, yet again, absolute angels and made us all feel secure and heard. We left the hospital with a beautiful baby boy and only positive memories of the entire experience.  \r\nIt would be hard to overstate how professional and empathetic every member of staff we came into contact with was. Words would not describe how beautiful the service is here, even if baby brain had allowed me to access all of them! I could not recommend the BGH enough to those looking for a positive experience of one of the most revolutionary events a person can go through.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-01-18T18:36:30.6833333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-01-20T12:24:22.967","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Borders","count":5},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":1},{"name":"Scottish Government","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/732302","id":"732302"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/732302/responses","id":"732302"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/732302/healthservices","id":"732302"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/732302/tags","id":"732302"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/b120h_501","id":"B120H_501","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anaesthetist","id":"anaesthetist"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/attentive","id":"attentive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/c-section","id":"c-section"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/epidural","id":"epidural"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/inspired","id":"inspired"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/labour","id":"labour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/maternity","id":"maternity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/midwives","id":"midwives"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/patient-centred","id":"patient-centred"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professional","id":"professional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassionate","id":"compassionate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/empathetic","id":"empathetic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/empowered","id":"empowered"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happy","id":"happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/empowering","id":"empowering"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20ease","id":"at ease"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/732441","id":"732441"}]},{"id":732432,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Fantastic caring service ","body":"I had to bring my 92 year old mother to the emergency eye clinic on Sunday 19th January.

But my last visit was the last straw. I don't normally complain, but how can the service improve if no one is saying anything.  \r\nAt Elgin A&E staff always seem to be newly qualified, and it just seems to me like no one knows what they are doing.  \r\nThe last person I saw, leaned into my face and was talking to me I felt cheekily, talking down, talking over me, contradicting my illness which they clearly didn't know much about. I had to then wait a lot longer due to me asking to see someone else after myself explaining that I felt this staff member was being rude.  \r\nAt 4am, when you have came into hospital to recieve help since you cant breath, you don't ever want to be treated like this, the staff member was quite happy to put me out the door, after not even looking down my throat, or looking at my previous notes.  \r\nPreviously before that, I had been in and out of A&E regularly, at least once a month, sometimes every 2 weeks. For about 9 months.  \r\nI had to explain that ibuprofen makes me very ill and cannot take it for my condition (endometriosis)  \r\nSo their answer was to give me a higher anti inflammatory.  \r\nWhich I came to this conclusion that it was that that was making me a lot worse, so when I was ill, I would take the medication, thinking it would help, and ended up in there every 2 weeks with worse symptoms.  \r\nThey thought I had anaphylaxis, due to the stomach inflamed, and arms and hands cold and tingling, I could not walk and thought I might die, I was in that much physical agony.  \r\nI really think that they should be ensuring that they read patients medical notes before or during seeing them.  \r\nAnd feel that they are just sometimes not experienced enough, and some can be very rude. Probably due to being understaffed.  \r\nThe A&E department I feel, should not be a place where students get to experiment on something as important as the human body, there should be experienced staff ready for what ever comes into the doors at any point.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-01-20T11:47:18.7166667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-01-20T12:55:51.347","readBy":[{"name":"Scottish Government","count":2},{"name":"NHS Grampian","count":7},{"name":"Ulster University, MBBS (Medicine) 2021","count":1},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":1},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2020)","count":1},{"name":"Office of Rhoda Grant, MSP for Highlands and Islands","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/732419","id":"732419"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/732419/responses","id":"732419"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/732419/healthservices","id":"732419"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/732419/tags","id":"732419"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/n411h_180","id":"N411H_180","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20upset","id":"very upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/arms","id":"arms"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/endometriosis","id":"endometriosis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/face","id":"face"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/inexperienced","id":"inexperienced"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/notes","id":"notes"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sent%20home","id":"sent home"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attitude","id":"staff attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stomach","id":"stomach"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/throat","id":"throat"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tingling","id":"tingling"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/understaffed","id":"understaffed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/trust","id":"Trust"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20disappointed","id":"very disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/naproxen","id":"naproxen"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/talked%20over","id":"talked over"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/741133","id":"741133"}]},{"id":732440,"author":"dayleyward","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"A follow-up call would have benefited me greatly","body":"Whilst utilising the day ward at Grantham hospital, the nurses and doctors were absolutely brilliant!

A few days later I had no recollection of being given a discharge note, what they had done or what was said.  \r\nA follow-up call the next day or two would have benefited me greatly, as the pre and post-op notes I was given had different explanations as to what had actually been done in surgery on the day.","criticality":"minimally critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-01-20T13:07:36.1666667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-01-20T13:10:49.517","readBy":[{"name":"United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust","count":11}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/732440","id":"732440"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/732440/responses","id":"732440"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/732440/healthservices","id":"732440"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/732440/tags","id":"732440"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rwdlp-day-ward","id":"rwdlp-day-ward","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nervous","id":"nervous"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctors","id":"doctors"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/follow%20up","id":"follow up"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good","id":"good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professional","id":"professional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/calm","id":"calm"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/relaxed","id":"relaxed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/funny%20staff","id":"funny staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20ease","id":"at ease"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/conflicting%20information","id":"conflicting information"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/732466","id":"732466"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/732474","id":"732474"}]},{"id":732364,"author":"Mr Anonymous","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"In safe hands with professional people","body":"I attended A&E after falling at height from a tree.  \r\nFrom the moment I entered the hospital site help was on hand.

I was seen for my initial appointment with the gynaecologist within weeks of my GP's referral. I then had my Pre Op a few weeks later and my surgery was scheduled shortly after. The staff at all levels from start to finish were outstanding and an absolute credit to their profession.  \r\nOn the day of my surgery itself I had my procedure explained to me thoroughly by the Consultant, and was seen by the anaesthetist. Both explained the procedure thoroughly and found the time to answer my questions.  \r\nI was then given a bed, and the nurse Hayley chatted to me and explained the process etc. The student Nurse again was brilliant at making me feel at ease whilst she took my obs. Nothing was too much trouble.  \r\nIt was obvious to see that the staff were under pressure, they work long shifts and with very limited resources but at every stage of the way they took their time when dealing with a various mix of patients on a full ward. They really should be congratulated on the work they do whilst maintaining a smile. I absolutely couldn't fault them.  \r\nI did feel annoyed when other patients at times I felt made unnecessary demands and had unrealistic expectations of very busy clinical staff who were helping them by attending to them on wards when they were obviously needed elsewhere in the hospital.

In March 2019, we were told that a referral for Ear, Nose and Throat had been made. Aware that waiting lists within the NHS are long, we waited with great patience. This was a wait of approximately 8 months.  \r\nAfter chasing this up, we were informed by Speech & Language in November 2019 that the referral had not been processed properly. Approximately an hour after this call, S&L phoned my husband back , stating that they had emailed Audiology in March, to request that our son required an assessment of his hearing. However, after writing to the Head of Paediatric Audiology regarding this, I received a voicemail on 6th December 2019 stating that the referral from S&L, dated 22nd March 2019 was never received by the Paediatric Audiology department.  \r\nIt is then stated that S&L contacted the department in November 2019, asking why there had been no appointment given. We were then told, due to the amount of time we had been waiting, that the department was able to offer us a cancellation appointment at the end of November and that our son had now been referred onto ENT. Audiologists diagnosed mild to moderate hearing loss measured within the sound field and suspected that he had glue ear. Again, due to the time we had been waiting, they managed to get us an appointment with ENT, Clinic 7 Outpatients, to see a consultant. The consultant assessed our son and said that he would require Grommets and Adenoid surgery.  \r\nWe were then contacted by the Waiting List co-ordinator in December, to inform us that our son was on the waiting list for surgery, however there would be a minimum of 3 months waiting time but it could be longer. I felt that this was a very generic letter that did not take into consideration the time that my son had already been waiting. I decided to state my concerns in a letter of response which was addressed to the Waiting List Co-ordinator and was sent under the ‘Next day delivery’ service in December 2019. Again, mindful of the Christmas and New Year period, I waited patiently for a reply. After waiting over 4 weeks, I decided to phone the waiting list co-ordinator, on the number provided on the letter. I explained my son’s situation and they were unable to help but they were able to give me the number of their complaints line. I phoned this and spoke to a waiting list co-ordinator, whom was aware of the letter I had sent. They said that a reply had been sent out in early January. I have yet to receive this reply.  \r\nOn talking to her and explaining the situation, she told me that the Speech and Language, Specialist Children’s Services were independent of the hospital. Given that the S&L letters are headed with an ‘NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde’ logo, it gave us the impression that S&L were working in partnership with the hospital or at very least the NHS?? However , apparently not and therefore they had to go with the referral date that was given by the QEUH in December 2019, as opposed to the original date in March 2019. Furthermore, I was then told that the current waiting time is now 15 months! How is this fair on my 4 year old son, who has been waiting this whole time???  \r\nI explained that my son has experienced difficulty with communication at nursery, as a result of his hearing impairment and given that he is due to start school this August, we need our son to be fitted with temporary hearing aids until he is given surgery(as was previously discussed with audiology). The waiting list co-ordinator emailed the Head of paediatric Audiology, to ask them to contact me. I have yet to hear from them.  \r\nThis has been an extremely stressful and anxious wait where my son has suffered terribly from multiple ear infections. Chasing this up with emails, letters and phone calls has been very time-consuming and costly, when we have ensured mail is sent with the ‘Next Day Delivery’ service.  \r\nOur aim now is to get our son appointed for surgery at a time when he *should* have been, according to our original referral date and ensure that he is fitted with temporary hearing aids as a matter of urgency. Right now, we do not know who to turn to next, for the help our son needs.  \r\n","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-01-19T16:41:04.8766667","progress":"Change planned","dateOfPublication":"2020-01-20T14:21:59.433","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":15},{"name":"St. Andrews University ScotGEM Medical Students","count":1},{"name":"Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists (RCSLT)","count":1},{"name":"Scottish Government","count":2},{"name":"Office of Johann Lamont, MSP for Glasgow Pollok","count":1},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/732351","id":"732351"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/732351/responses","id":"732351"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/732351/healthservices","id":"732351"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/732351/tags","id":"732351"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/g513h_120","id":"G513H_120","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxious","id":"anxious"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/adenoid%20surgery","id":"adenoid surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appointments","id":"appointments"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/audiology","id":"audiology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ent","id":"ent"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/information","id":"information"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/long%20wait","id":"long wait"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/speech%20and%20language","id":"Speech and Language"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/time%20wasted","id":"time wasted"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting%20lists","id":"waiting lists"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/733130","id":"733130"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/733750","id":"733750"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/733832","id":"733832"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/772080","id":"772080"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/772608","id":"772608"}]},{"id":732451,"author":"Rusty00","authorRoleId":4,"authorRole":"a relative","title":"You all make such a difference","body":"My husband was recently in Ward 4B at the QEUH having a stem cell transplant. &nbsp;

I am glad now that after discussing this with him I only had one foot done and the other will be done at a later date, hopefully not to many months from now. The nursing staff in the day surgery ward namely Karen and Lisa were fantastic. So caring and reassuring. Karen noticed I was a bit anxious and all it took from her was an arm round the shoulder and a bit of reassurance to make me relax a bit. They were both so attentive to all the patients, it was the best experience I have had from any of my hospital visits over the years.
