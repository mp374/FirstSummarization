Got antibiotics for that, unfortunately they weren't working great so ended up my Dr telling me to go to hospital, got seen initially by a becs nurse practitioner, ended up with a cannula put in and iv antibiotics. Was in and out of hospital for 3 days getting iv drip. After that was on a 10day course of antibiotics. Got a phonecall to go back in to get bloods checked as something flagged up in liver function. So went back into get it checked and all was fine. Finished the 10 day course, but it still wasn't quite cleared do had another course for 5 days.

The care he received in SATA was second to none and the staff were amazing! He was then transferred to ward 15 where again the staff were amazing! My grandpa is 90 and has dementia. The staff in ward 15 had him up out of bed singing and dancing and I cannot thank them enough!  \r\nHe was then transferred to ward 8 and this is where the problems began. He was left in bed all day, not changed into his own pajamas despite having at least 3 clean pairs and the patient in the bed next to him commented how he cried all day and not one member of staff came to see if he was OK. My grandpa is no longer able to feed himself and despite this the staff left him to feed himself which he was unable to do and his lunch therefore ended up all over the floor and himself. On one occasion I was helping him to eat when staff members, who I felt were very rude, gave me into trouble for actually helping him!  \r\nI understand that all staff are very busy but to leave a 90 year old man with advanced dementia sitting in a chair all day every day for weeks with little or no stimulation is completely unacceptable. He was so upset and the change in him from ward 15 to ward 8 was terrible. By the time he left ward 8 he couldn't walk and had developed delirium.  \r\nAs an NHS employee I completely understand how busy everyone is and the extreme pressure everyone has and are continuing to face however we cannot forget that we are nursing extremely vulnerable patients and it is extremely upsetting for them also to be away from family for long periods without any visitors.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-09-11T19:17:02.0133333","progress":"Change planned","dateOfPublication":"2020-09-15T09:45:44.66","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":15},{"name":"Yorkshire & Humber Patient Safety Research Collaboration","count":1},{"name":"Scottish Government","count":1},{"name":"Plymouth University Health and Human Sciences students, 2018","count":1},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/785940","id":"785940"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/785940/responses","id":"785940"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/785940/healthservices","id":"785940"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/785940/tags","id":"785940"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/c418h_300","id":"C418H_300","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20upset","id":"very upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/assessment","id":"assessment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/attention","id":"attention"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dementia","id":"dementia"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dementia%20awareness","id":"dementia awareness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/most%20staff","id":"Most staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attitude","id":"staff attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vulnerable","id":"vulnerable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/one%20ward","id":"one ward"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/786444","id":"786444"}]},{"id":786143,"author":"CRD","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Not being able to get an appointment","body":"So, I have a history with depression and anxiety, and the last few months both have got really bad.

Sometimes I'll get a recorded message saying to call at another time, I do and still don't get through. Today I got one saying \"to get this number please call [a different number]\". I called it and the number was not regognised. I know these are busy times but I've been seriously needing an appointment for over a month, and constantly trying to fit in phoning the sugary, when phone calls give me anxiety, has been really rough.  \r\nI have tried using the online appointment system but this didn't work either. They seem to be half way through transitioning between two websites. The first says they've moved and the second says they haven't got that surgery yet. And I can't seem to log into either of them with some information I'm told I have to go to the surgery for. The surgery's doors are closed they only let you in if you have an appointment.

Unfortunately, this faith is misguided.. I cannot see how any 'extra training' is going to rectify or improve a poor attitude, completely argumentative to anything you say or suggest and ultimately make you feel you are an inconvenience to them (so much so that I'd consider not bothering to call or visit due to the hassle and stress they exert... a dangerous environment for a doctors surgery).\n\nThis visit should have been routine, collecting a print-off for a repeat prescription for my child and a prescription for my wife also.  Apparently, she cannot accept verbal requests for this documentation and require an email, she was straight on the offensive soo much (even when I pointed out I just wanted the form to tick the boxes to then get the prescription), she was completely unhelpful bordering rude so I gave up with that and said I wont bother (won't bother to get my sons inhaler and insulin.... completely unimportant right) and my wife will have to sort... oh can I collect her repeat prescription you have in stock.. to be told that's a different dept and I'd have to ask the pharmacy and get back to you.. couldn't be made  to feel any more awkward and inconvenient if she'd tried (shocking people skills).. on being asked if I had prescription paperwork for that - I again gave up and left.\n\nOn speaking to my wife, an email cannot be sent for a child prescription request so that info is completely incorrect.  It seems as if the receptionist gives completely conflicting information and ends up tying herself up in a web of her own misinformation.  Very disappointing that so many reviews on here are attributed to the receptionists incompetence but I'm afraid until the situation is  addressed I cannot see anything improving.

By this point it was too late to make an appointment.My elderly parents have described similar problems to me over the past weeks. It is simply not good enough. I also feel that the messages read out to suggest ways of reducing caller traffic are potentially very confusing and inaccessible to elderly people particularly in their reference to the online methods of making contact. I have seen messages to say that there are only 6 or 10 people answering phones and understand the difficulties social distancing poses but the messaging system  needs to improve to take account of this. Some people would have believed that they had the wrong number and not persisted. I eventually decided to do the electronic referral form which was mentioned but the form would not open on the first 3 occasions that I tried. I left it for a few hours and have now completed it.

I have had a number of occasions when I can honestly say that she may have saved my life. There were times when things were extremely difficult and I could see no way out; during these times she was kind, patient and practical. Not only did she treat me with conventional medications, on a short term basis - but she also ensured I had longer term complementary talking therapies available to me. My GP never once made me feel that my issues were unimportant or that I was taking up her precious time with something trivial. I always had her full attention, she empathised and most importantly she listened. \nWhatever the issue might have been over the past 6 years, both my partner and myself have enjoyed a truly wonderful service from the team at this practice. \nWe both feel very grateful to have such a caring and cutting edge practice at our disposal. It is a flagship institution and my own personal GP is worth their weight in gold.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-09-14T12:40:02","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2020-09-15T12:48:48","readBy":[{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2022)","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/786500","id":"786500"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/786500/responses","id":"786500"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/786500/healthservices","id":"786500"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/786500/tags","id":"786500"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/ach","id":"ACH","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unimportant","id":"Unimportant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/weight","id":"weight"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wonderful","id":"wonderful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blessed","id":"blessed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/on%20edge","id":"on edge"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/saved","id":"saved"}]},{"id":786490,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Quick & easy Flu Jab","body":"We used the drive in facility to get our flu jab this year.

Unfortunately for most of the further experience, I would agree, the previous post is very accurate. My experience with an other individual has been very difficult. Problems in communication; always asked the same not very relevant questions from a set list and after answering these, no following up interest. It seems only a yes or no answer was being asked for. My feeling, my experience and conditions was never really discussed in a empathetic manner, it was all just awkward, these on avourage 10 minute appointments. And understanding that one person can't be an expert on all conditions, still to be so unknowledgeable on my condition was alarming to me. Eventually, I felt like I needed to stir the conversation towards useful topics, but this, after the end of  the conversation, let me to be discharged, without informing the team, GP or me first and with a condition still to be treated. The complexity of my situation seemed too difficult and I seemed a burden for asking for help. At best, 4 or 5 years has been wasted with this individual, a time I could have spend on getting real help.\nI am aware going private is not an option for many, but if you can, the cost could be so much less to your mental state. Please believe your loved ones when they express they are having a real negative experience here, they might end up needing your support even more then when they first got here. On the whole, including other professionals, I can only say the system is not fit for purpose. I can just give it a one star rating, despite the reception staff seeming friendly and the fantastic treatment I have received by this one most recent individual which turned out to be sadly a rare occuring experience it seems. Sad as I would give this person and one other professional a 5 out of 5 star rating, especially a pity to them, as they were working in a very challenging environment, but there is only so much you can make up for others lack of care.

Unfortunately she was moved to ward 4 overnight during that morning she was told she would be going for a ultrasound even though she explained she had been for one the previous day. The staff told her there was no documentation of this happening, On 2nd ultrasound showed no stones which the dr in MAU said she wouldn’t be able to pass it as it was 1cm (so where’s it went) she was taken off IV antibiotics as her temp and heartrate came down, But would have to have them orally. She was discharged after a further two days, to be told her discharge letter and antibiotics would be sent to her home with the blood bikes, on visiting her at 19.30pm they still hadn’t arrived. She was due to take them at 1800hrs and she still wasn’t feeling to good. At 20. 00 I phoned bgh and the problem was immediately sorted by the senior nurse. They phoned me back to say that the problem was that someone had forgotten to send them.

I was worried as I have auto immune diseases and ended up having to buy antiseptic cream. The monitor had be put back in a wallet and you had forms on which there was personal information such as your name and hospital no. On returning the monitor, my husband went to the first window where they are returned, and discovered at least five other envelopes, all with the monitors and personal details of patients which could so easily have been stolen at any time! When my husband took the monitor into back to the window, he went into the hospital to report what he'd seen, i.e. the backlog of folders and monitors all within easy reach. No one was in the room where they were and did not seem to have been for a while. In the hospital my husband was told abruptly, \"That's why the window is there, so people don't have to come in.\". He then went back out of the corridor to the main reception and told the receptionist there. Who said they'd ring someone up. My husband had noted on the folder it said about the different prices of monitors and the cost to the hospital if not returned. I also phoned my own doctors for advice about the mark and they said to contact the hospital, and tell them about the monitor, but when I did they wanted to put me straight through to that same department.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-09-12T10:21:58.9533333","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2020-09-15T14:27:28.15","readBy":[{"name":"Warrington and Halton Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/786052","id":"786052"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/786052/responses","id":"786052"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/786052/healthservices","id":"786052"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/786052/tags","id":"786052"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rwwhg_100","id":"RWWHG_100","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rwwhg_320","id":"RWWHG_320","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/angry","id":"angry"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/worried","id":"worried"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/advice","id":"advice"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/auto%20immune","id":"auto immune"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cream","id":"cream"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/heart%20monitor","id":"heart monitor"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/instructions","id":"Instructions"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/patient%20confidentiality","id":"patient confidentiality"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/skin","id":"skin"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attitude","id":"staff attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/septic","id":"septic"}]},{"id":786354,"author":"AYK","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Visit to NHS Louisa Jordan","body":"Was an extremely long walk considering I have a hip problem.

My husband had a very sore eye, pain in his head and blisters on his cheek.  I rang the surgery at 8am, the GP rang me at 9am.  I sent pics of his face through a special link.  The GP rang me at 10am. Said it looked like shingles.  He sent an urgent prescription to the chemist and I picked up the medication at 11am.  He spoke to the eye clinic at St Richard's and they rang me and we had an appointment that afternoon. They were really thorough and it was a relief to know that the shingles wasn't affecting his eye.  So in one day we had the best treatment without even seeing anyone until the eye clinic doctor.  I think we do have to think about doing things differently and I’m glad we were able to do it all over the phone.  It was quicker, slicker and safer.  It was amazing.

I arrived at 11.45am and checked out I most certainly was - triage nurse, triage doctor, X-ray, blood test, CT scan, a cup of tea & biscuits followed by a trolley ride to Heybridge Ward A303. I arrived on ward around 3.15pm which I thought was astonishing quick in the circumstances. I had multiple cracked ribs, a cracked scapula and a partially collapsed lung - so I guess I didn't quite get away with it. I was on the ward until 7pm the following (Friday) evening. I would like to put on record that from the time of my arrival at A&E until my discharge every single person involved in my diagnosis and care went about their work in a thoroughly professional manner with good humour, treated me with respect and most of all were extremely caring, thoughtful and kind. This includes not only the many nurses & doctors, but the receptionists, cleaners & caterers. Every single one of them was a credit to their profession and, of course, themselves.

On both occasions I had the opportunity to observe the staff while I waited. Not all of them present in a professional way. One has long hair, not tied back which is untidy and lank, she addresses the pts as ‘love’, which is not in accordance with the Equality & Diversity guidance. Another said Ta to a pt instead of Thank You. Only a few have ID or name badges and two were discussing a pt within the hearing of people waiting. \nSome, I imagine, are unqualified but that should not mean untrained. There is a certain way people expect to be treated when they visit a hospital, professionalism at all levels is mandatory. The attitude in that unit is far too casual and relaxed.\nIn addition, because no name badges are worn, and they all wear theatre scrubs, it is impossible to tell what designation most of the staff are. \nI retired from nursing only a few months ago and was, at one time, a Sister within this Trust as well as a Lead Nurse in the community. I would never have allowed the sloppy image I witnessed today to exist on my watch. Times change, I appreciate that, but standards ought not to drop because of it.\nI do not include the reception staff in my observation, they were perfectly professional. \nWhoever manages this unit, needs to take note and improve the presentation and attitude of the staff. It is as if some of them find it hard to draw the distinction between being in a socially relaxed situation and displaying a workplace persona. Frankly, I get a more professional attitude from my hairdresser. \nI’m sure whoever reads this will take my point.

If you need to use the service you have to deal with them. Initially you will be told you cannot see a GP. Then you will be told your case is not serious enough or an emergency. I once tried to explain I knew I was not an emergency, therefore I need to see a GP and not A&E, the phone was put down. Sometimes you will be told all the appointments have already been taken and the surgery may have only been open 20minutes. However if you are lucky enough to see a GP and you need a follow up your not allowed one as they don’t do future bookings. You have to call back on the day you need the follow up. So I don’t know how a full day of appointments can be gone within 20minutes of opening. When you call back for your follow up several days/weeks later. Your told your not allowed an appointment and you don’t get to decide you need a follow up the GP does. If you try to debate this with them your spoken down to and told your wrong. I needed a sick note and was told I couldn’t have one and when I pressed why. It was because I hadn’t seen the GP after the allowed self certification time. When I explained it was because they wouldn’t let me see the GP (for the reasons already stated) they told me they couldn’t help and it wasn’t their fault I hadn’t seen the GP. As a service they repeatedly make it increasingly more difficult to see a medical professional. When you try to discuss with them they shut you down and tell you your wrong. They refuse to take responsibility for their actions and the “rules” of the service.

If the nurse from the surgery had not acted quickly and had me seen I would have died.
