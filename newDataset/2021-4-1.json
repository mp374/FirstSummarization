On arrival at the ICU I was met with the most professional staff and having never been in hospital I felt extremely vulnerable. The staff were very supportive and able to give me information from the ECG which showed that I had a heart block and that I would be admitted into the Cardiology Ward where I would probably have a Pacemaker fitted.  \r\nI was admitted to Cardiology that day where I was attached to a heart machine and my pulse and blood pressure were monitored regularly. Staff were concerned regarding my pulse which was between 28 and 30 bpm. During the night it fell below this and one of the doctors came to me, about my condition as he was extremely concerned.  \r\nI had a Pacemaker fitted and almost immediately. I felt better as my pulse returned to normal. I am now on the road to recovery. I dread to think what could have happened if I had not gone into hospital that day. I cannot thank the staff at the hospital enough and I have already sent thank you cards to the two depts.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-03-10T12:09:44.2766667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-04-01T08:18:33.323","readBy":[{"name":"Doncaster and Bassetlaw Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/830985","id":"830985"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/830985/responses","id":"830985"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/830985/healthservices","id":"830985"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/830985/tags","id":"830985"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rp5dr_320","id":"RP5DR_320","score":4},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20pressure","id":"blood pressure"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cardiology","id":"cardiology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ecg","id":"ecg"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/heart","id":"heart"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/intensive%20care","id":"intensive care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pacemaker","id":"pacemaker"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professional","id":"professional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20concerned","id":"very concerned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vulnerable","id":"vulnerable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/timely%20treatment","id":"timely treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20supportive","id":"very supportive"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/848798","id":"848798"}]},{"id":835539,"author":"HelenL","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"LiveWell - Working Win.  My access to this service.","body":"At a time when I was having to take some time out due to being overwhelmed and overcome at work it was suggested to me that I refer myself into the Working Win project (hosted by South Yorkshire Housing Association). At a time when I knew that mental health services were at their limits due to the levels of demand, I grabbed at the opportunity to speak to someone.  \r\nI gained a Return to Work Coach and a Health and Wellbeing Coach along with access to Westfield Health and TogetherAll (an online chat portal for support). I can honestly say that I have had the best, most wrap around care, most bespoke support and have been made to feel so valued and 'heard' than I have ever with any other service.  \r\nMy Return to Work Coach understood my role and level I had reached in my organisation and understood the pressures and anxieties that I was experiencing. He coached me through organising my thoughts about my role, what it was that had got me to this point and therefore what was going to get me back to work but in a better more sustainable way. We created a plan of action which I used to help prompt me in my first return to work chat with my organisation. We also talked about progression, about what I actually wanted to do workwise, why shouldn't I look for something more in tune with my likes and dislikes rather than just where my talents lie. These two things 'my skills' and 'my preferences' were not necessarily in the same role. He also shared with me his experiences which led me to trust him further.  \r\nMy Wellbeing Coach was just the person I needed. We only spoke a small number of times but I was able and comfortable to share everything. Whilst she made me feel comfortable in the beginning she also also pushed me to test and question some of my thoughts and assumptions. To question why I thought the way I did about certain things. To realise that just because one person has an opinion on you or your work that might be negative, that should cloud or rule out any other positive voices. Why listen to that 1%? Why try to please that 1% when they are never going to be pleased at anything?  \r\nWe also talked about perceptions of working women, those with high positions in organisations and who had leadership positions. What their reputation might be like and what they thought about it. The fact that my perception of having that high position was that it would mean loosing the work/life balance I would want by working 50 hours per week, made me not want to pursue anything like that. She challenged that perspective and offered up examples of where a job share arrangement for two women in a Director role had succeeded.  \r\nBoth my coaches were a directory of information and further help that is available, something that I would have struggled to find myself. Whether it was clips of speakers knowledgeable about the topic we had just been speaking about or resources on interview techniques and question styles.  \r\nThe existence of this project has been a lifeline to me. The people I have met through it have been amazing, caring, knowledgeable, friendly, constructive, practical, thought provoking and committed. I will forever be grateful to them as I feel that I have grown and changed as a person because of their input. I believe that this type of service should be available to anyone and directly through healthcare providers and if in my professional career I had the power to make that happen, I would.  \r\nI will be forever grateful and thankful.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-03-26T10:00:42.2266667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-04-01T08:40:23.04","readBy":[{"name":"South Yorkshire Housing Association","count":5}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/835539","id":"835539"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/835539/responses","id":"835539"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/835539/healthservices","id":"835539"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/835539/tags","id":"835539"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/1-101660555-working-win","id":"1-101660555-working-win","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/balance","id":"balance"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/heard","id":"heard"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/positive","id":"positive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/practical","id":"Practical"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/talking%20therapy","id":"talking therapy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20pleased","id":"very pleased"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing","id":"amazing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported","id":"supported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thankful","id":"Thankful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/trust","id":"Trust"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/valued","id":"valued"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wellbeing","id":"wellbeing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety%20support","id":"anxiety support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/work%20coach%20support","id":"work coach support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20supportive","id":"very supportive"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/836787","id":"836787"}]},{"id":836600,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"poor administration","body":"Poor administration, on DR. iQ Dr had prescribed medicine to my son but the prescription was not sent to pharmacy, i have been to surgery and also telephone calls for five working ways, no one helped, my son had a lot of pain in the right ear. ","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2021-03-31T16:49:26","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-04-01T08:43:04","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/836600","id":"836600"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/836600/responses","id":"836600"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/836600/healthservices","id":"836600"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/836600/tags","id":"836600"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/f84642","id":"F84642","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ear","id":"ear"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helped","id":"helped"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pharmacy","id":"Pharmacy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/854933","id":"854933"}]},{"id":836349,"author":"Whoever","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Lack of information about the approach of the 'CFS' clinic","body":"I have had Myalgic Encephalomyelitis for the last forty years plus. I need a specialist's letter confirming the diagnosis, a written management / treatment plan, and an OT to arrange a wheelchair assessment.  \r\nMy GP would like the treatment plan to advise on prescribing LDN, mestinon or other medication to see if it will halt the decline - I can't currently get up for more than about ten minutes a time a few times a day.  \r\nThe GP referred me to the above clinic. When I rang the clinic to ask if they could confirm that their clinical approach is to regard ME, in line with the WHO and the NHS, as a physical/neurological disease, and not as psychosomatic or an FND - as this information was not on the web page - they couldn't tell me, and didn't even understand the question.  \r\nI do not consent to being seen or treated by, (or referred to) doctors or other health care professionals who do not regard ME/CFS as a physical/neurological disease. This is to ensure I have up-to-date doctors who will not harm me by prescribing GET or other discredited 'treatments', it provides me with continuity in my health care, and it means I don't come away feeling 'gaslighted' by doctors telling me my disability is 'all in the mind' when the science (for example at Stanford University among other international centres) has research data showing clearly that it isn't.  \r\nI do not want to receive treatment based on a thoroughly discredited piece of research done in the UK called 'Pace', which was so badly done, it is used as a teaching example of how not to do research. Because of the lack of information on the web page of the 'CFS' clinic, and the lack of awareness of the issue by the person who answered the phone I have had to decline the referral as I simply have no assurance of the approach they are using or that they will respect the boundaries of my consent and be able to find anyone suitable to see me.  \r\nWhen I explained the boundaries of my consent to the admin, the response was there is nowhere in the system to record this so the information cannot even be passed on ahead of the appointment.  \r\nI have spoken with my solicitor and as there seems to be no way to get the information ahead of the appointment or for my consent to be recorded, I have decided to refuse to be seen there.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-03-30T14:23:54.01","progress":"Change planned","dateOfPublication":"2021-04-01T08:45:48.597","readBy":[{"name":"Royal Cornwall Hospitals NHS Trust","count":7},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2021)","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/836349","id":"836349"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/836349/responses","id":"836349"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/836349/healthservices","id":"836349"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/836349/tags","id":"836349"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/ref","id":"REF","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/chronic%20fatigue%20syndrome","id":"chronic fatigue syndrome"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/consent","id":"consent"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diagnosis","id":"diagnosis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/information","id":"information"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/myalgic%20encephalomyelitis","id":"Myalgic Encephalomyelitis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wheelchair","id":"wheelchair"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/spoken%20over","id":"spoken over"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fnd","id":"fnd"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/836652","id":"836652"}]},{"id":836599,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Excellent practice","body":"I along with my family have been patients at the surgery for almost 20 years.

They took the time to calm my nerves and give me a lot of reassurance whilst waiting to go in to theatre.  \r\nProud to be part of the NHS.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-03-30T17:19:50.3066667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-04-01T08:57:13.487","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":9}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/836381","id":"836381"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/836381/responses","id":"836381"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/836381/healthservices","id":"836381"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/836381/tags","id":"836381"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/c418h_100","id":"C418H_100","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/c418h_180","id":"C418H_180","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nervous","id":"nervous"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/abdominal","id":"abdominal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency","id":"emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gallstones","id":"Gallstones"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helpful%20staff","id":"helpful staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/laparoscopic%20cholecystectomy","id":"Laparoscopic cholecystectomy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/operation","id":"operation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/proud","id":"proud"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/calmed","id":"calmed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kept%20updated","id":"kept updated"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/837788","id":"837788"}]},{"id":835417,"author":"Tangerinetwirly","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Trigeminal Neuralgia","body":"I was suffering with Trigeminal Neuralgia, an extremely painful condition. After having spent a week in a lot of pain not knowing what was wrong with me I had a horrific weekend. At one point I spent 4hours locked in my bathroom to shield my children from seeing me in so much agony. I got an emergency appointment with my GP and he was amazing. He listened to me, immediately diagnosed what was wrong and talked me through a plan of action. Being sure to tell me not to panic if the first treatment didn't work as there were other options. He started me on carbamazepine and arranged to phone me a few days later to see how I was and discuss my dose. He continued to either phone me or see me every few days to see how my symptoms were and to up the dose of medication. I was completely pain free within 14 days. I was then able to come off the medication after two months, confident that I can restart meds immediately the condition flares up again.  \r\nI cannot thank my Dr enough. His treatment was exemplary and the hope & support he gave me that I would be pain free made a massive difference.

This positive experience is heightend by the rude, unprofessional, and unhelpful manner of the reception staff particularly on the phone. I find myself interrupted, and not listened to on frequent occasions. I've found especially in the last two years a degree of sensitivity around my and my partners health to be entirely absent from the reception staff. This is very strange to me, as those answering the phones are tasked with speaking to people who, like I have been, potententially worried or in crisis. It doesn't take much effort to let someone finish a sentence, or to make them feel heard. This has been a continual frustration with the practice, and the only reason either my partner or myself continue to go there is that the doctors and nurses are so good. We regularly spend 15 minutes preparing to deal with the reception staff before calling, which creates a lot anxiety around a already heightened situation.

I have called on 5 different days, waited over half an hour on the phone each time, ranging from being no 50 in the queue to no 43 each time and eventually after getting through the 'Care Navigator' tells me there are no appointments left and to call back again tomorrow.  \r\nMy symptoms remain as severe pack pain, abdomen pain, arm weakness, memory loss, crashing tiredness, leg pain, pins and needles, shoulder pain, neck and jaw pain and for the past couple of days now dark coloured urine also. I also had issues with swallowing that I've had in the past and thankfully a nurse practitioner arranged blood tests and a referral to Hairmyres for this. She said I really needed to see a doctor for all of the other issues, as did the consultant I then saw at Hairmyres. How can I see a doctor when each time I call I am told all of the appointments are gone. Why can't an appointment then be made for the next day since it's obvious I need an appointment.  \r\nEach phone call, the Care Navigator is told all of my symptoms. On one of the calls last week I was told if it was any consolation it sounded like what they had last October and it was so bad they had to set an alarm to remember to let my dog out. But there was still no appointments available today and that I needed to call back tomorrow. This is not acceptable behaviour. I'm clearly worried about my health and do not feel well one bit that's why I'm trying to get a doctor's appointment. It seems next to impossible.  \r\nThe whole process is inhumane and devoid of any compassion towards people trying to 'win the lottery' of getting an appointment. In my opinion it's awful and leaves me feeling very low and demoralised.

I was examined internally by a Senior Registrar who was very thorough but gentle and I didn’t experience any pain, only slight discomfort when a scope was inserted. The Registrar needed confirmation after a very thorough examination, and the Consultant was asked to come.  \r\nI felt immediately when they appeared that they were perhaps under pressure and annoyed at having to attend. Their manner was very abrupt. They told me that they would have to do a biopsy and take a small amount of tissue from the cervix. They told me that it would be a little painful but would not last for long. I was not asked to sign a form to give permission for this procedure. I was not offered pain relief of any kind. The experience of the removal of tissue from such a sensitive internal area was no less than agony. I screamed during the biopsy, I have never felt pain like it although I have given birth twice, the pain was worse than that. My scream sounded unearthly to me, like an animal in terrible pain. Part of my inside was being cut without any anaesthetic.  \r\nI am 73 years old. I was not told how to take care, I. e. not to lift things etc afterwards. I found that out from a web site. I haven’t cried for years, but I cried when waiting for my husband to collect me from the hospital. The consultant in my view showed no duty of care in the way they treated me, no consideration in failing to offer a local anaesthetic. I felt I had endured an assault.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-03-30T21:02:53.4366667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-04-01T11:04:12.613","readBy":[{"name":"University of Stirling, Faculty of Social Sciences","count":1},{"name":"Dartford and Gravesham NHS Trust","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/836391","id":"836391"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/836391/responses","id":"836391"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/836391/healthservices","id":"836391"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/836391/tags","id":"836391"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rn707_502","id":"RN707_502","score":0},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20upset","id":"very upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anaesthetic","id":"Anaesthetic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/assault","id":"assault"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/attitude","id":"attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/biopsy","id":"biopsy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/birth","id":"birth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bleeding","id":"bleeding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cervix","id":"cervix"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/consultant","id":"consultant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hysteroscopy","id":"hysteroscopy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain%20relief","id":"pain relief"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/registrar","id":"registrar"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vaginal","id":"vaginal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20angry","id":"very angry"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/836654","id":"836654"}]},{"id":836388,"author":"hydraks43","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Great Care, Great caring Staff","body":"My young son fell and broke his arm.

(duration 8 minutes).  \r\n  \r\nI would like to mention that in January, after consulting a psychiatrist from Mersey Care, I was ordered medical tests - blood, ECG of the heart. The issue concerned the possibility of increasing the received medications, including pain medication. The medications and doses prescribed for me had not been altered for at least three years. Despite the unsuccessful reconstructive procedure of the left foot, a lack of fusion for 16 months - living in severe pain - the GP did not consider increasing the doses of pain medication.  \r\n  \r\nThe 8-minute telephone conversation I have mentioned shows that there is no such possibility for me as a patient. This is what the GP said. Therefore, a question that remains open for me is the sense of examinations being performed. In addition, the GP stated that the medications I receive are the maximum doses, which is not true. The conversation was characterized by the extraordinary haste and a lack of any interest, not even with the result of the hospital visit a few days prior. The GP made their decision without knowing anything about my mental and physical condition - and they had never seen me, nor had they seen any deformities in both feet and ankles - which is, in fact, the case with all doctors at Woolton House. This is not how a relationship between the patient and the GP is described in the NHS Constitution.  \r\n  \r\nMy additional question concerning the Covid 19 immunization was met with a response that I am not considered a person with long-term illnesses, including severe disabilities, and that I am not currently eligible for vaccination - according to the government schedule, people with conditions like myself are now vaccinated. Unfortunately, I do not qualify... for what reasons? Or am I the incorrect nationality?  \r\n  \r\nTo summarize. Having a high degree of respect towards doctors and being a man of culture, I clearly will not receive the help and support of NHS England, as representative of the overall healthcare system. The 8 minute consultation brought me to the brink of my emotional endurance. I am not garbage, nor a second-class human being. I do not consent to being treated beneath any standards. To the arrogant and downright rude behaviour of a physician as experienced as this one.  \r\nIn this regard, I do not see any further point of tormenting me with tests, because - as the GP stated - I will not receive an increased dose of painkillers (on the principle - 'because I say so').  \r\nI also do not see the purpose and sense of a psychiatric consultation in April, because the declarations of a psychiatrist consultant do not translate into mundane reality. In my dealings with the GP.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-03-26T14:40:50.4033333","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2021-04-01T12:20:01.253","readBy":[],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/835644","id":"835644"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/835644/responses","id":"835644"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/835644/healthservices","id":"835644"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/835644/tags","id":"835644"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/n82066","id":"N82066","score":2},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disappointed","id":"disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20tests","id":"blood tests"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/concerned","id":"concerned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ecg","id":"ecg"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/feet","id":"feet"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/foot","id":"foot"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/heart","id":"heart"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication%20review","id":"Medication Review"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/painkillers","id":"painkillers"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attitude","id":"staff attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tests","id":"tests"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vaccination","id":"vaccination"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20concerned","id":"very concerned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/time%20given","id":"Time given"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20disappointed","id":"very disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/informed%20decision%20making","id":"informed decision making"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/conflicting%20information","id":"conflicting information"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%2019","id":"covid 19"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gp%20advice","id":"gp advice"}]},{"id":836145,"author":"October2020","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Giving birth","body":"I feel that I had quite a traumatic experience during the birth of my son in October 2020.  \r\nI admitted to The Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh one day mid October to be induced (as it was suspected that my baby was going to be rather large). The induction process took 3 days and while not exactly pleasant, was ok. The nurses were attentive and friendly and I was excited at the thought of giving birth and meeting my baby.  \r\nOn the 4th day at 3am I was transferred to the labour ward. I was met by an amazing midwife and student midwife. They put me at ease instantly and I was feeling relaxed. They broke my waters at 4am and started the oxytocin drip. I was then in the room for 6 hours before I had an unplanned c section. These 6 hours felt very traumatic for a number of reasons:  \r\n1. The midwives shift finished and the brilliant team went home. I felt the new midwives didn’t really seem to care about me, they seemed more concerned with ticking boxes and paperwork.  \r\n2. The baby was in the wrong position so the midwives were trying to coax him into a different position by moving me into very strange positions, despite it being not what I wanted or comfortable. I could feel myself getting distressed.  \r\n3. I hadn’t dilated more than 3cm so the midwives rapidly increased the oxytocin drip until it reached its maximum levels. I had high blood pressure at this point and the contractions were medically distressing both me and the baby.  \r\n4. The midwives spoke to a consultant and got authorisation to go above the maximum drip levels. The pain was too severe so I had pain relief in addition to gas and air.  \r\n5. At this point I was told that the baby’s head was still in the wrong position. A c-section was mentioned. I couldn’t speak from the pain of the effect of the increased drip and the drugs. I relied on my husband to communicate my wishes. My husband, who had been virtually pushed aside during the process.  \r\nI was then transferred to the theatre and the most amazing anaesthetist in the world (newly arrived from Italy, wearing a brilliant Star Wars head cover - I’m ashamed to say I’ve forgotten his name) quickly and efficiently administered the epidural and although I could barely communicate with him, his care and compassion meant the world to me.  \r\nThe operating theatre staff were all amazing. My son was delivered quickly and efficiently. The midwives took my husband so he could watch the weighing and checks etc. They were rude and abrupt with him and he wasn’t sure what was going on. They told him measurements without explaining what that meant - if everything was fine/normal or not? He remembers they put a white wool hat on my son’s head, then cut the umbilical cord so blood splattered all over the hat. Seems a strange thing to write about here, but that was his lasting memory. Not a good one.  \r\nWhen we went to recovery, another very checklist oriented staff member tried to force me to breastfeed. Not showing me how to do it, but rather aggressively forcing my son to my breast. I did want to breastfeed and still am doing so thankfully, but it was not done in a supportive or helpful way post surgery. I was left feeling useless and confused about feeding.  \r\nWhen I returned to the ward, my catheter broke and I was lying in urine for a while. I managed to get a nurse to help me but it was around shift change and I remember feeling that I was being a nuisance to her.  \r\nFollowing this, I was on the ward until Sunday. When I tried to get nurses to help me with the baby or my c section recovery, it was a struggle. Sometimes it would take 40 mins to an hour for anyone to respond to the call button. Obviously if I needed to pick up, feed or change my son, this wasn’t helpful. I ended up doing everything myself. I feel like I was ignored because I refused the pain relief drugs (I have had bad experiences with post surgery morphine before and didn’t want to take it). A friend of mine was also on the ward at the same time, she always had support, had help with lifting the baby and the midwives took the baby for her at night so she could get some rest. I got none of these things.  \r\nI had a breakdown on the Saturday night. I’d had virtually no sleep since the Monday when I was admitted for induction. The ward was loud with many disruptions overnight - moving bed spaces and crying babies. One nurse on shift was very helpful and arranged for me and my son to sit in a separate room at 3am to prevent us from leaving the hospital.  \r\nOn the Sunday, I asked to be discharged. When the consultant finally came to see me they got me mixed up with someone else and tried to go through someone else’s details, experiences and situation - at first they didn’t believe me when I told them their mistake. They then discharged me without going over any of the details of what had happened to me. I think I was in a bit of shock at this point and just desperate to leave.  \r\nMy baby was excessively crying at the same time and I remember no one helping me. I felt abandoned. A feeling that had characterised my stay in hospital post-birth.  \r\nIt’s taken me a while to really process my experience. I believe my labour was unnecessarily traumatic, as was my time post-birth in hospital.  \r\nI am eternally grateful for the theatre staff and anaesthetist for both psychologically saving me and for bringing my baby into the world.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-03-29T15:37:46.29","progress":"Story has a

patient","title":"Treatment for eye problems at the Glaucoma Clinic","body":"My right eye seemed to have made an excellent and rapid recovery after being damaged in accident in the 1970's. although it has needed several surgical interventions to keep it working effectively in the years up to my retirement in 2013.  \r\nThen, however, functioning in it deteriorated significantly and in spite of a marvellous Corneal Graft operation in the RVH Ophthalmology Dept.in December 2016, a all sight in my right eye had failed by Easter 2018. About retirement time as well, a cataract had been noted in my left eye. It was developing only very slowly, but by summer 2018 I was unable to see to drive my car, read a book or newspaper, or watch television; so quite a miserable time for a widower living on his own!  \r\nAt that time I was referred to the Glaucoma Clinic Shankhill Rd. for a review of my condition, primarily the long term maintenance of my blind eye,  \r\nDuring the review meeting the Consultant, having examined my eyes, gave me the bad news and the good news. Firstly on my blind right eye: that nothing could be done to recover sight in it but I would need to maintain it correctly, potting drops in it as prescribed and seeking help promptly if there seemed to be any change in its condition. Secondly on my left eye the good news was that it was generally in good condition and the cataract in it was definitely mature enough to be removed safely and that the Consultant would be happy to do the operation, scheduling it as a priority in the Clinic's work list.  \r\nI was delighted to be able to look forward to a New Year when I could drive again, read, watch television and begin to redevelop a social life.  \r\nThe Clinic was as good as its word: they conducted the operation in January, they were clearly well experienced and everything went very smoothly, they had me in and out of the theatre in around half an hour, sitting up, looking around seeing things with a clarity I hadn't enjoyed for years.  \r\nApart from protecting the eye when sleeping for a few days and taking some additional antibiotic eye drops for a few weeks there were no additional precautions to be taken  \r\nand bi-annual visits would suffice.  \r\nMarch 2021  \r\nAt Christmas Time 2020 I began to be increasingly distracted by an irritation in the right-hand corner of my right eye. I remembered that Mr Frazer had mentioned that a suture had been intentionally left in that eye at the time the corneal graft was carried out (Jan. 17) and it might be might advisable to have it taken out at some time. Left it for a while because of Covid restrictions but decided to get advice from Glaucoma Clinic. Phoned Ms Knox's Sec. and explained my problem. She phoned back with an appointment date one week hence (in spite of Covid restrictions.)  \r\n9th March Visited Glaucoma Clinic. Good Covid precautions in place. Seen by Nurse and by Doctor who gave me eye pressure test & Visual Field test. (O.K.). Met Consultant who discussed my eyes generally and my problem with my right eye. He geared up, sanitised and removed offending suture on the spot and gave me and gave me a prescription for chloramphenicol to apply in my eye for a fortnight. I told the Consultant how much I appreciated the helpfulness of the whole Clinic and he invited me to record that via Care Opinion. I have now used up the chloramphenicol and am having no problem with my eye so I am now trying to complete my part of the deal.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-03-29T20:22:34.13","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-04-01T12:55:39.48","readBy":[{"name":"Belfast Health and Social Care Trust","count":12},{"name":"Patient and Client Council","count":1},{"name":"Public Health Agency","count":1},{"name":"Ulster University, Faculty of Life and Health Sciences","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/836164","id":"836164"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/836164/responses","id":"836164"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/836164/healthservices","id":"836164"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/836164/tags","id":"836164"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt001_11021_130","id":"ZT001_11021_130","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cataract","id":"cataract"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/corneal","id":"corneal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/delighted","id":"delighted"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/excellent","id":"excellent"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/eye","id":"eye"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/eye%20drops","id":"eye drops"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/eye%20problem","id":"eye problem"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/eyes","id":"eyes"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helpful","id":"helpful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/infection%20control","id":"infection control"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ms","id":"ms"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/response%20time","id":"response time"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appreciated","id":"appreciated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happy","id":"happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/went%20smoothly","id":"went smoothly"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/836839","id":"836839"}]},{"id":836314,"author":"Tw1990","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Change is very challenging","body":"I have recently been told by my health visitor that she will be moved to a different area from the end of April and I will have a new health visitor.  \r\nI currently stay within rigside where I have recently moved to. since having my baby I have had issues with my mental health.  \r\nI feel my health visitor has been a massive part in my journey to regain positive mental health again and this journey has only just begun.  \r\nFaced with the fact she will no longer be working in rigside has caused me and can only imagine every other family she works with a great deal of uncertainty.  \r\nBeing in my current situation the thought of change is very challenging.

I was kept informed throughout of what was happening and going to happen to me. I had numerous bloods, CT Brain Scan, Lumbar puncture and a CT Angiogram of brain, all services received were excellent. Nursing staff were lovely, Drs thorough - in fact all staff carried out their jobs professionally from staff doing tea trolley/cleaning to pharmacist. Words cannot express my appreciation for the care I have received and follow up planned. Referred onto service - MRI & physio in order to see if possible, injection can help my diagnosed condition. Excellent services from a fab team in very trying times.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-03-31T10:18:40.6666667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-04-01T13:14:29.047","readBy":[{"name":"South Eastern Health and Social Care Trust","count":4}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/836470","id":"836470"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/836470/responses","id":"836470"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/836470/healthservices","id":"836470"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/836470/tags","id":"836470"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt004_07021_180","id":"ZT004_07021_180","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt004_07021-9","id":"zt004_07021-9","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/angiogram","id":"Angiogram"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/brain","id":"brain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/brain%20scan","id":"brain scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ct","id":"ct"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/excellent","id":"excellent"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good","id":"good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/injection","id":"injection"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kept%20informed","id":"kept informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/looked%20after","id":"looked after"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lovely","id":"lovely"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lumbar","id":"lumbar"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lumbar%20puncture","id":"lumbar puncture"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mri","id":"mri"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/physio","id":"physio"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scan","id":"scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/team","id":"team"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thorough","id":"thorough"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/triage","id":"triage"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/well%20looked%20after","id":"well looked after"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appreciation","id":"appreciation"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/836646","id":"836646"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/836648","id":"836648"}]},{"id":836458,"author":"travellertc66","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Receiving my first jab","body":"I went for my first Pfizer jab often booking it online for the 60-64 age group.

I was impressed by being encouraged to sit in a waiting room for 15 minutes, which the nurse timed, before asking if I was OK and letting me go to the Admin table to book my second jab in May. All in all, a very positive experience!!  \r\nThank you, EVERYONE, in the NHS - you are doing a totally fantastic job, which is really appreciated, provided to us, for free, in great facilities!

I'm new to these treatments and was very nervous commencing an immune system lowering regime at the height of the pandemic. The Day Centre has ample space for safe social distancing, toilets within easy reach, is spacious and airy. The setting feels less intimidating than arrival and treatment at the main hospital sites of CAH or DHH. The team - nurses, doctors, healthcare support staff, have been fabulous in settling my nerves, explaining my treatments, helping me feel safe, and doing everything they can to ensure my experience goes smoothly every time. I'd be very happy to come to South Tyrone on a regular and ongoing basis for these treatments. Thank you to the team who've been so knowledgeable and supportive in this great safe space.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-03-31T09:51:27.1966667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-04-01T13:34:31.353","readBy":[{"name":"Southern Health and Social Care Trust","count":5}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/836462","id":"836462"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/836462/responses","id":"836462"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/836462/healthservices","id":"836462"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/836462/tags","id":"836462"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003","id":"ZT003","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_31024-dcc","id":"ZT003_31024-dcc","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nervous","id":"nervous"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/colitis","id":"colitis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/great","id":"great"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/knowledgeable","id":"knowledgeable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/safe","id":"safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supportive","id":"supportive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/team","id":"team"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ulcerative%20colitis","id":"ulcerative colitis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing","id":"amazing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happy","id":"happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassuring","id":"reassuring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/explanations","id":"explanations"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/went%20smoothly","id":"went smoothly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/social%20distancing","id":"social distancing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pandemic","id":"pandemic"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/837766","id":"837766"}]},{"id":836457,"author":"browserkb68","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"District nurses are great","body":"I have had district nurses visiting since October to help me with dressings on a wound that is taking time to heal.

Appointments take forever, fair enough, but when you don't get one and you're seen, it's another battle trying to follow up regarding your situation. You would expect that if you've been seen, they would book your follow up on the spot, and if any tests need doing, you would at least get a text sms when they are all completed to put your mind at ease. But most times they forget about you. And then when you try to follow up, they tell you to call back on a specific day, and when you do that the doctor that was supposed to do the follow up is not available and you have to deal with another doctor who is unfamiliar with you and the situation. I wish there was a private clinic near by because this setup seems higgledy-piggledy and the follow up function is dire. I'd prefer to pay out of pocket, at least for my mum, as that's what she does in the Caribbean where she's from and gets seen and tests done one the day! Back there might not have as many specialists as the UK, but the GP side of things is so much simpler and quicker. Are there any private clinics near Saffron Walden?

It must be scary for staff knowing that they are potentially being exposed to this virus, but no one treated me any differently and did their best to keep me calm.  \r\nI was in hospital for six days and it was difficult as I couldn’t see my children or loved ones.

I was nervous about the balloon induction, but the staff were really kind and supportive, allowing me to have gas and air and talking me through the process. It was comfortable and much less frightening than I thought. I was able to go home overnight before coming back to have my waters broken. Once labour started I was able to labour in my own, then get into the pool for as long as I warned. Staff were so kind, working around contractions to look after me, and only making themselves known when absolutely essential. When the pain became too much they quickly arranged for an epidural which was delivered professionally and kindly by the fantastic anaesthetist. Much more comfortable, I was able to enjoy labouring (the dose was just what I wanted-took away the worst of the pain but left function and some sensation). When it came time to push I was guided and supported by two lovely midwives who encouraged me and enabled me to labour in the position I wanted. I felt so in control of my choices and experiences throughout that the whole process was magical. Thank you to all the staff who helped us have such a wonderful day preparing to meet, and then delivering, our daughter.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-03-31T18:27:22.9866667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-04-01T15:02:01.127","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Borders","count":3}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/836526","id":"836526"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/836526/responses","id":"836526"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/836526/healthservices","id":"836526"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/836526/tags","id":"836526"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/b120h_501","id":"B120H_501","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/birth","id":"birth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/birthing%20pool","id":"birthing pool"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/broken","id":"broken"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/contractions","id":"contractions"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/encouraged","id":"encouraged"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/epidural","id":"epidural"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gas%20and%20air","id":"gas and air"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/giving%20birth","id":"giving birth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helped","id":"helped"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/in%20control","id":"in control"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/induction","id":"induction"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kind","id":"kind"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/labour","id":"labour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/maternity","id":"maternity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/midwives","id":"midwives"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professional","id":"professional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fantastic","id":"fantastic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported","id":"supported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wonderful","id":"wonderful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20at%20ease","id":"put at ease"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/birthing%20choice","id":"birthing choice"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/836703","id":"836703"}]},{"id":836467,"author":"GMcP","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Labour and delivery of my first baby!","body":"I had my little girl in the Queen Elizabeth Univeristy Hospital in Glasgow in February and wanted to take the time to thank some of the staff who looked after me during my labour and delivery, as well as in the post natal ward.  \r\nI arrived on the afternoon before and went to maternity assessment. The midwife who looked after me was fantastic! After examination I was told I was 3cm dilated and my husband could come and join me as I’d be moving to the labour ward shortly. The pain at this point was pretty intense already and the midwife was incredible at helping me manage my contractions and keeping me as calm as possible.  \r\nWhen we arrived in the labour ward the next midwife initially looking after us wasn’t great. She was generally quite rude and dismissive and as I was really struggling with the pain at this point her attitude was quite disheartening. I was refused access to a birthing pool, told I would need to remain in bed for constant monitoring and that I wasn’t allowed to eat or drink anything other than water. Having done hypnobirthing I knew my rights and that eating and drinking shouldn’t have been denied. Although I had gestational diabetes, my consultant had advised I was incredibly healthy and there was no need for labour restrictions to be placed on me (such as no birthing pool/continuous monitoring). I found the pain difficult to manage as I wasn’t allowed to move from the bed so opted for gas and air, followed by an epidural to help me manage the pain. The staff members who administered my epidural were absolutely amazing and kept me calm and informed.  \r\nWhen the shift staff changed to night shift I was joined by 2 wonderful midwifes. They were so kind, supportive and friendly. They told me what was happening each step of the way, why they were doing certain tests and checks and were very considerate of my feelings. With them in the room my husband and I instantly became more relaxed and actually enjoyed the process more.  \r\nFollowing several hours with my epidural, a hormone drip to keep contractions going and having my waters broken, I was stuck at 8cm dilated and baby was beginning to get a little stressed...baby had also done a poop inside so there were concerns regarding this also. At this point a doctor came in to assess and advised they’d leave me for another few hours to progress, but a c section may be required. After a few more hours I was assessed again and it was decided surgery was the best option. I was initially a little upset with this, however the staff offered great comfort and reassurance. I met with the anaesthetist who was so lovely and explained all surgical procedures to me.  \r\nThroughout my time in theatre everyone I have mentioned, along with so many more staff, were all on hand to offer words of encouragement and support to my husband and I. The c section went smoothly and before I knew it we were in recovery with our healthy baby girl!  \r\nWhen I was moved to the postnatal ward (ward 50, I think!) my husband had to leave. I was pretty terrified at being alone with my new baby girl as I was still numb and unable to move my legs due to the anaesthetic I had been given. I needn’t have worried though as I was given outstanding care and support in the ward by the staff, specifically one person who offered help and encouragement with breastfeeding (I honestly don’t believe we’d have had a successful breastfeeding journey with her!) and provided moral support to me as I was quite nervous as a first time mum looking after a tiny baby!  \r\nI cannot thank all the staff at QEUH enough for the care provided to me and my little one during this time. I honestly wish I could thank them all individually in person as they truly were amazing!","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-03-31T10:08:33.46","progress":"Story has a

I went to the out of hours triage department at Forth Valley where I was taken into a room with Katie (I think was her name, wish I knew for sure! ), and I think she was as surprised as me to find out how far along I was.  \r\nShe didn't leave my side once until our baby girl was safely in my arms - she was just so amazing at keeping me as calm as could be and talking to me the whole time - something about her voice just made me feel safe & in control.  \r\nSpecial recognition has to go to Billie the student midwife who was also there delivering our baby, for telling me how to breath & especially letting me squeeze her hand so tight - you've got an amazing career ahead of you.  \r\nSusan looked after me after I had given birth and the care & reassurance from her was exceptional. A lot of the work involved with being a midwife must be far from easy but she just seemed so happy and content with what she was doing, even at 3am.  \r\nI'll be forever grateful to the 3 of them, and the rest of the Maternity Staff.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-03-31T12:45:37.3566667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-04-01T15:03:29.84","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Forth Valley","count":6}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/836494","id":"836494"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/836494/responses","id":"836494"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/836494/healthservices","id":"836494"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/836494/tags","id":"836494"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/forth-valley-royal-maternity","id":"forth-valley-royal-maternity","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/birth","id":"birth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/giving%20birth","id":"giving birth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/important","id":"important"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/maternity","id":"maternity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/midwives","id":"midwives"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/safe","id":"safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/triage","id":"triage"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happy","id":"happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/student%20midwife","id":"student midwife"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/836770","id":"836770"}]},{"id":836593,"author":"woodpigeonrf47","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"An excellent service","body":"I went to the minor surgical skin team at Forth Valley Royal Hospital for a biopsy.

We contacted the Out of Hours Doctor who came to the home to see Mum. My Mother was adamant she did not want to go into hospital as she had been in hospital for 5 weeks over Christmas and due to Covid she was not allowed visitors, which of course was an extremely difficult time for both her and her family.  \r\nThe Doctor said he would contact her GP and suggested the Acute Care Team should come to the home to see her. The Acute Care Team arrived to access Mum on the 8th March. What a relief it was for us to have this Medical Support as since Mum came home from hospital we had only received phone calls from her GP which was totally inadequate.  \r\nWe had an extremely professional Medical Army ascending on her home. They completely took over her care. We had Consultants, Doctors, Nurses, Dietitians, and Occupational Health etc. all working tirelessly in the home to stabilize her. They carried out tests and prescribed medications and continued to work with her for almost a week until her condition improved. The care she received from the Acute Care Team was second to none. We believe she would not have been given the same one to one care in hospital and of course she was able to remain in her home with her family around her.  \r\nWe as a family are always be grateful to the whole team and would highly recommend this brilliant service.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-03-31T14:42:44.69","progress":"Story has a

forever grateful to CGL, and in particular Jack, Anthony, Veronica and Chandni, all of whom have supported me unconditionally to finally recover and embrace sobriety, save and change my life around, without their support I would have lost everything, now I am so happy and at peace with life and also again with the help of Chandni we are exploring my psychological issues to maintain my recovery and get further help from mental health services with secondary investigation.  \r\nI will be forever indebted to CGL and sincerely hope they continue offering their support and services as they currently do with the same staff and facilitators as cgl because I feel any drastic changes to their support network and protocol could have a very negative and harmful effect on my recovery and

He was very professional and took all the time my wife needed to discuss her symptoms. He spent and while and reassured us that we would get the right help. He popped in and out the whole night to ensure things had settled. Charlotte continued to nurse my wife through the night.

I explained that as a secretary with contact with the dr, I just needed to speak to them as I had so much pressure behind my eyes due to high dose of steroids. The secretary wasn't helpful at all and instead told me to contact nurses station at rheumatology dept.  \r\nI rang 111 who advised me to go straight to Queens Hospital at Urgent Eye Clinic which I did and ended up with 2 eyedrops as I had lots of inflammation behind my eyes When I contacted Nurses station at KGH, a really nice, kind person answered the fone and said it was the secretary's to job but they would help me. They left an email for my rheumatologist, who I'm still waiting for to contact me.  \r\nMy appt last year in march was cancelled and I havent been given any other appt for follow up for my arthritis either. I'm not holding my breath for my rhumatologist to contact me. I want to know how to change my consultant for another one who will take my serious medical problems seriously. I still can go blind with Temperal Arteritis as I am not being given aftercare. I'm still on steroids. I havnt had my blood pressure checked or had test for diabetes which can occur with Steroids.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-03-31T21:48:47.2266667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-04-01T15:39:20.773","readBy":[{"name":"Barking, Havering and Redbridge University Hospitals NHS Trust","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/836536","id":"836536"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/836536/responses","id":"836536"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/836536/healthservices","id":"836536"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/836536/tags","id":"836536"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rf4dg_410","id":"RF4DG_410","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/aftercare","id":"aftercare"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/biopsy","id":"biopsy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood","id":"blood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20pressure","id":"blood pressure"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20tests","id":"blood tests"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cancelled%20appointments","id":"cancelled appointments"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ct","id":"ct"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ct%20scan","id":"CT scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diabetes","id":"diabetes"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/eye","id":"eye"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/eyes","id":"eyes"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/face","id":"face"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/follow%20up","id":"follow up"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/head","id":"head"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helpful","id":"helpful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scan","id":"scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attitude","id":"staff attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stitches","id":"stitches"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tests","id":"tests"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/the%20change","id":"the change"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wait%20for%20results","id":"wait for results"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/837231","id":"837231"}]},{"id":836590,"author":"Nicola83","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"My diagnosis and illness","body":"I was diagnosed with bowel cancer last week and told 4 days later it was stage 4.

The police came to us looking for our loved one, but it transpired that they had just gone on holiday abroad. Despite this holiday being approved by staff, they were unable to make this known to the police, but they told the family when we asked. We carried on as normal, with communication being one-way from us, as sometimes happened. About six months later we were advised by the Housing Association that they had not been resident all this time and the tenancy had been lost. They had not returned from holiday. We approached their team who confirmed this. Alone, abroad, unmedicated, uncared-for, friendless, they came to serious harm. We feel excluded, angry, distressed, and fearful for their future in a system which is not capable of configuring itself to provide basic safety and a decent way of life to our loved one, despite the family's willingness to help.","criticality":"strongly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-03-19T11:07:01.5633333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-04-01T15:50:10.957","readBy":[{"name":"East Renfrewshire Health & Social Care Partnership","count":1},{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":8},{"name":"Scottish Recovery Network","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/833302","id":"833302"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/833302/responses","id":"833302"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/833302/healthservices","id":"833302"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/833302/tags","id":"833302"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/g600h","id":"G600H","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/angry","id":"angry"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ignored","id":"ignored"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/neglected","id":"neglected"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20cared%20for","id":"not cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/alone","id":"alone"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compulsory%20treatment","id":"compulsory treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/distressed","id":"distressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/duty%20of%20care","id":"duty of care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/empathy","id":"empathy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/family%20involvement","id":"Family involvement"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fearful","id":"fearful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fobbed-off","id":"Fobbed-off"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care%20efficiency","id":"Care efficiency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/responsibility%20for%20care","id":"responsibility for care"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/836694","id":"836694"}]},{"id":836692,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Disgusting communication","body":"Rang for an appointment to get a sick note.
