I was made feel at ease and was explained everything very clearly about waiting time and what would happen next.  \r\nNothing was an issue to staff they were very busy on my arrival, they seated me in a room with 4 beds and returned to do bloods and observations this was all done in 10 minutes of arrival this is a very efficient and effective service for the hospital, I was in and seen within about 3 hour and returned next day for an scan which again was booked and ran very timely.  \r\nOnly to discover I needed an operation after being scanned. I would very much like to give my thanks for the support they showed me in this area. The support shown to my wife from the nurses ( sorry if I get the names wrong) Leah, Iona and Rachel was outstanding they made her tea and gave her something to eat she was is a diabetic and hadn't eating anything because she was worrying about me, Iona also made sure my wife got home safely by calling our daughter and walking her to the carpark and calling to keep my family updated on my time in there due to no visiting. I cannot thank the nurses enough and in debt I will always be to them. This service is a credit to the NHS and I hope it long may continue, I hope other hospitals follow on from this unit.  \r\nI was admitted to ward 13 where I got excellent care from I was admitted till discharged, the staff were friendly and helpful they spoke me through my drain and the after care I would receive from them and the weeks after. I cannot thank ( again sorry if I get the names mixed up there was so many nurses) Suzanne, Megan and Rosie enough they were fantastic thank you girls. I was in a room of 4 again and the other men also spoke about how great the surgical wards are and how grateful we all are for the care that was showing to us all at the time we needed it the most. Only issue was no bacon on the breakfast menu but we can deal with that.  \r\nFollowing on from this I had to go back to surgical ambulatory care the following week in fact for several weeks I had attended the clinic and all I can say is it's a fantastic service. I get there about 8-9 and out for lunch, the girls always were welcoming and always smiling. We all know they are doing a fantastic job and keep up the superb work in this area, I was reading the posters based on statistics through the unit and all I can say is a huge well done.  \r\nTake care girls and I wish not to see you again in these circumstances but I will never be able to thank you enough.  \r\nAll the best the grumpy auld yin as the wife told you all.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-08-18T22:44:24.5666667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-08-20T10:18:35.69","readBy":[{"name":"Office of Colin Smyth, MSP for South Scotland","count":1},{"name":"NHS Lanarkshire","count":5}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/871784","id":"871784"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/871784/responses","id":"871784"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/871784/healthservices","id":"871784"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/871784/tags","id":"871784"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l308h_100","id":"L308H_100","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l308h-amb","id":"l308h-amb","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l308h-care-of-the-elderly","id":"L308H-Care-of-the-Elderly","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/excellent","id":"excellent"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/great","id":"great"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/operation","id":"operation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scan","id":"scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/seen%20quickly","id":"seen quickly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/smiling","id":"smiling"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fantastic","id":"fantastic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hope","id":"Hope"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20ease","id":"at ease"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thanks","id":"thanks"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/872139","id":"872139"}]},{"id":871724,"author":"Nodens","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Therapy success!","body":"During a period in my life where I was experiencing depressive symptoms, my GP prescribed me Setraline. I had a bad reaction to the medication, which caused me to have a breakdown. This was during a tumultuous period in my life so the medication was not solely to blame. Traumatic memories bubbled to the surface and I broke down crying in the GPs office. As a result of this breakdown, I was referred to psychiatry to be treated for PTSD. The sad part was that, due to the trauma specialist leaving, I had an incredibly long wait (18 months) to be seen for treatment. However, when I did begin treatment, I met a nurse who changed my life. I will refer to them as K.  \r\nIn the initial meeting with K, we both agreed that therapy was a collaborative project, one which was based on trust and respect. It was through these concepts that I was able to build confidence within the therapy and K themselves. My trauma was not something we immediately tackled. First, we needed to work on the basics. This included help with managing my sleep, appetite, exercise and general physical health. Following this, K and I shifted the focus onto the psychological elements. This included building my self esteem and challenging negative thoughts. Admittedly, during these sessions, I did sometimes wonder why we were not ‘fixing’ my trauma. However, by going through all these exercises and doing the work, I realised I was gaining confidence and calmness within myself. It was only then that K and I agreed I was ready to begin using a technique called EMDR. EMDR is a specific technique which is used to treat trauma. It works by regressing a person into their trauma and, through a combination of lights, eye movement and guided talk, will desensitize an individual to the past experience. This is a lengthy process and can only really be done with a person who is in a stable(ish) mental state and who is willing to engage with the therapist. The only reason I was able to do it is because K was able to instil a sense of safety and trust in them. Otherwise, I would have not felt comfortable or confident enough to do so. I was in therapy with K for 2.5 years, and I have recently been discharged. I am writing this as a way to say thank you to them, as without them, I do not think I would be alive to write this entry. Furthermore, I wanted this to be a way for other people to understand that it is worth the wait and not to give up. I am thankful for the NHS, and the people who work within it, who change other peoples lives for the better.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-08-18T19:28:38.2233333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-08-20T10:29:17.43","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Forth Valley","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/871724","id":"871724"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/871724/responses","id":"871724"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/871724/healthservices","id":"871724"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/871724/tags","id":"871724"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sv9-outpatient-centre-psyc","id":"sv9-outpatient-centre-psyc","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sad","id":"sad"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/traumatic","id":"traumatic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/access%20to%20mental%20health%20services","id":"access to mental health services"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breakdown","id":"breakdown"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/depressive","id":"depressive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/effective","id":"effective"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emdr","id":"emdr"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/included","id":"included"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ptsd","id":"ptsd"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/respect","id":"respect"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/self%20esteem","id":"self esteem"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/therapist","id":"therapist"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wait%20times","id":"wait times"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confidence","id":"confidence"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confident","id":"confident"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thankful","id":"Thankful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/trust","id":"Trust"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/alive%20again","id":"Alive again"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/no%20confidence","id":"no confidence"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/crying","id":"crying"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/872685","id":"872685"}]},{"id":871763,"author":"Cherry63","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Biopsy/hysteroscopy","body":"I am 8 years post surgical menopause. Two weeks ago I had a small PV bleed. My GP referred me to Gynae under the 2 week cancer pathway.  \r\nI suffer from vaginal atrophy, bladder prolapse and a variocele. Internal examinations are excruciating.  \r\nI had a pelvic plus internal scan a week after referral.  \r\nMid August, I saw a gynae consultant, went through some medical history, and explained my problems with pain. Even smear tests are incredibly painful.  \r\nI was offered a biopsy there and then. I had a panic attack, crying and hyperventilating. I asked for local anaesthetic and was told no, they can't give any injections here. I was offered the choice to return later the week if I needed time to think about it, but I said just do it as I didn't want to be worrying about it.  \r\nThe pain was absolutely excruciating and the biopsy was unsuccessful. Only then was I told I could come back and have a local. I don't think the Dr was rough, it was my problem.  \r\nThat night I couldn't sleep, I was emotionally and physically traumatised, and very weepy the next day.  \r\nTwo days afterwards I was back again, saw a different consultant, explained it all again.  \r\nI had taken paracetamol, maloxicam and diazapam before attending.  \r\nFirstly the speculum was very painful, so the consultant replaced it with a smaller one (why not use the smaller one to start with?). The injection wasn't too bad, but it didn't have time to work before the procedure started.  \r\nThe procedure was not explained to me, I was expecting a pipelle biopsy, not a hysteroscopy, and was taken completely unawares when they started pumping water into me. I was yelling, crying and shaking with pain, but they didn't stop until the nurse told her to.  \r\nI only had time to dress, before I was handed the referral paperwork to hand in at reception.  \r\nI have now been referred for the procedure under a GA but have been told it's a long waiting list.  \r\nI'm absolutely furious, I said prior to the procedure that I felt very strongly that as a woman, I know my body, I know how much it would hurt, and that I should have been told at the 1st appointment that I could have been booked in for the local.  \r\nI was very vocal about my fears, and feel that a GA should be available as a first choice for women with problems.  \r\nI questioned why a colonoscopy (I've had a few) is done with IV sedation and pain relief but that wasn't an option. I just got a blank stare.  \r\nI have previously worked in maternity in a different trust, and the ethos was very much women being made to feel empowered, given the chance to make informed choices with their care.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-08-18T20:18:24.8633333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-08-20T10:38:19.19","readBy":[{"name":"Northern Lincolnshire and Goole NHS Foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/871763","id":"871763"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/871763/responses","id":"871763"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/871763/healthservices","id":"871763"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/871763/tags","id":"871763"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rjl32_502","id":"RJL32_502","score":1},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/furious","id":"furious"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/access%20to%20pain%20relief","id":"access to pain relief"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anaesthetic","id":"Anaesthetic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/biopsy","id":"biopsy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bladder","id":"bladder"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bleed","id":"bleed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cancer","id":"cancer"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/colonoscopy","id":"colonoscopy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gynae","id":"gynae"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hand","id":"hand"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hysteroscopy","id":"hysteroscopy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/information","id":"information"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/injection","id":"injection"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/maternity","id":"maternity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/menopause","id":"menopause"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain%20relief","id":"pain relief"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/panic","id":"panic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/panic%20attack","id":"panic attack"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pipelle%20biopsy","id":"Pipelle biopsy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/prolapse","id":"prolapse"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scan","id":"scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sedation","id":"sedation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tests","id":"tests"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/traumatised","id":"traumatised"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vaginal","id":"vaginal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vocal","id":"vocal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/explanations","id":"explanations"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/informed%20decision%20making","id":"informed decision making"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/listened%20to","id":"listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/crying","id":"crying"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/offered%20general%20anaesthetic","id":"offered general anaesthetic"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/876783","id":"876783"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/877089","id":"877089"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/877179","id":"877179"}]},{"id":870686,"author":"Zannadee","authorRoleId":4,"authorRole":"a relative","title":"Sub-standard service","body":"My father has a history of skin cancer - in April this year he had a skin cancer removed from his scalp and was discharged back to the care of his GP Practice for dressings with instructions that if any further lesions appeared or the wound did not heal he should be referred back to the Dermatology clinic immediately rather than wait for his routine 6 month follow up. The wound is still needing be be dressed weekly and a new lesion has appeared on his scalp. My father asked the Practice Nurses several times whether he needed to see the GP to be referred back to Dermatology and was repeatedly told that everything looks OK. This week my father attended for his dressing and then asked at the practice whether he could make an appointment to see a GP - he was not asking for an appointment that day but just wanted the next available appointment. My father is elderly and has marked hearing loss so prefers to make appointments face to face as he struggles with communicating on the phone. He was informed at reception that he could not make an appointment in the surgery but had to phone to make an appointment. My father phoned this morning at 10: 10 to make an appointment, was asked to give details of why he needed to make an appointment and then was informed that a GP would phone him back today, when my father asked at what approximate time the GP would call he was informed that it would be when the GP had 'finished seeing patients'. My father has remained in the house all day waiting for a phone call from the GP which has never come. He will now have to wait until Monday and have to phone back again and presumeably go through the whole process again. I feel, as does my father, that this is unacceptably poor service from the GP practice. Whilst we understand that there may have been workload pressures for the GP would it have been too complicated to ask someone to ring my father back to explain what was going

old daughter after she injured her face. She has ADHD and can easily become very stressed and unco-operative but we had an extremely positive experience. From the moment we arrived all the staff were friendly and helpful and were able to put my daughter at ease. Everyone who came in to see us was extremely responsive to her needs. The nurses were so friendly and playful when doing her obs and the ED registrar and consultant came to see us very quickly. Everyone was and extremely reassuring and the calm environment really helped my daughter cope. The Max-Fax registrar came over to review my daughter immediately and arranged for an x-ray and follow up. When she was getting restless waiting for a specialist opinion she was offered an ice lolly. This was brilliant as it was just what she needed to help her cope with her x ray.

Thank you for such a positive experience at Mandeville today.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2021-08-19T15:44:07","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2021-08-20T11:44:41","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/872164","id":"872164"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/872164/responses","id":"872164"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/872164/healthservices","id":"872164"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/872164/tags","id":"872164"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/k82019","id":"K82019","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency","id":"emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/great","id":"great"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/positive","id":"positive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing","id":"amazing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20ease","id":"at ease"}]},{"id":871912,"author":"Scottish Lass","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"My hospital experience when I gave birth","body":"I gave birth at Raigmore Hospital in Inverness on 08. 08. 2021. I can't fault the two midwifes and care team who helped me deliver my child. They were amazing! How ever when I was moved onto the ward I felt like I was abandoned from then on when it came to me needing help to breast feed.  \r\nI understand that the hospital are very short staffed and I always new breast feeding was going to be hard. But I didn't realise how hard it would be, my child struggled to latch on and the midwifes would aways say buzz if you need help. I always did buzz as she wouldn't latch on or if she did only for a few seconds. The other mums on the ward were needy and were always buzzing for things. How ever I was more than happy to do stuff myself and I only ever buzzed when I needed help with her to latch on.  \r\nMany times I had to wait long periods of time before someone would help me including a time where it was 45 minutes. By that time my child was so hungry and crying that it made me cry and stress out. I hated that I couldn't feed her and felt awful knowing that she was upset and I couldn't do anything but wait for help. I am a first time mum and I needed help and support and I didn't feel I got that.  \r\nMy child had really bad jaundice and I had to stay in hospital for 3. 5 days. Which were stressful and tough for me. It was clear I was really struggling to breast feed so a midwife suggested that I express my milk as she knew how much I wanted my child to have breast milk and I didn't want to use formula. A couple of the midwifes supported me with my decision to try this including a student midwife from Robert Gordon University who I absolutely loved as she was amazing! She is a going to be a brilliant midwife and it was her who made what little good experience of my hospital stay good.  \r\nThe other midwifes didn't support me and I felt like I was a bad person for wanting to express. I was at this point still trying to breast feed. I was so tired as I wasn't sleeping. After speaking to the midwife who was there when I gave birth, I had the courage to tell the other midwifes that it was my decision to express my milk to give to my child and that I had to as my child wasn't getting from me. Since expressing my milk I was slowly building up the amount, occasionally I had to top up with formula as I wasn't making enough milk for my child. I had a good rhythm. On the day of me being discharged I had to wait 5 hrs for my discharge letter, everyone else was leaving and I was the only one left. Again I understand that the hospital are short staffed. But I needed to get home so my midwife could drop off express pump so I could continue to express my milk.  \r\nUnfortunately due to waiting so long for my discharge letter, I didn't get home till 6. 30pm which meant I didn't get the pump till the next day. I couldn't express for over 12 hours which then made what little milk supply I had stop. I had to use formula feeding over night to feed her as I was still struggling to breast feed her. This upset me as I didn't want to use formula.  \r\nAfter 6 stressful and upsetting days I had to accept that I couldn't breast feed, which was extremely hard for me to accept. I still express milk but I don't make enough to feed her so I have to top up using formula. I feel if I got the support I needed I would have been able to breast feed. I feel let down and my hospital experience was very tough and stressful for me.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-08-19T11:20:47.52","progress":"Change planned","dateOfPublication":"2021-08-20T11:45:06.587","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Highland","count":5},{"name":"Ulster University, MBBS (Medicine) 2021","count":1},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2021)","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/871912","id":"871912"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/871912/responses","id":"871912"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/871912/healthservices","id":"871912"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/871912/tags","id":"871912"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/h202h_501","id":"H202H_501","score":1},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/i%20hated%20it","id":"i hated it"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/neglected","id":"neglected"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stress","id":"stress"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20upset","id":"very upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/birth","id":"birth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breast","id":"breast"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breast%20milk","id":"breast milk"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breastfeeding","id":"breastfeeding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breastfeeding%20support","id":"Breastfeeding Support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/brilliant","id":"brilliant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/courage","id":"courage"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/discharge%20wait","id":"Discharge wait"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good","id":"good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helped","id":"helped"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/jaundice","id":"jaundice"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/me","id":"ME"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/midwives","id":"midwives"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/more%20staff","id":"more staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20good","id":"not good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/some%20staff","id":"some staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting","id":"waiting"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing","id":"amazing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happy","id":"happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported","id":"supported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/response%20to%20buzzer","id":"response to buzzer"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/loved","id":"loved"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tired","id":"tired"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20happy","id":"not happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/listened%20to","id":"listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/crying","id":"crying"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20home","id":"at home"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/874531","id":"874531"}]},{"id":872159,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Friendly hard working staff","body":"Staff were fantastic, first time staying on (Levington) ward overnight and can’t sing their praises enough. helpful, friendly, efficient and i have no hesitation in going back or recommending them.

I'd decided to try to change to Lymington hospital - primarily because of much easier parking - a while back, and this was very easy to do. Yes, on arrival parking was a doddle, but the whole procedure from start to finish was absolutely brilliant. I won't pretend that the colonoscopy was totally painless but the pain was manageable because of the care of both surgeon and nurses, who listened to me and acted accordingly in terms of pain control and kind reassurances. Luckily nothing detrimental was found, but if ever I have to have another colonoscopy I will make sure that it's at Lymington. Thank you to all involved.

Firstly when I went for my pre op etc I was told that I needed to stop taking certain meds 7 days before my operation. This was 6 days before my operation, luckily I had guessed this myself and stopped taking them... Not a great confidence boost as any blood thinners could have caused complications. On the day of the op I arrived and was shown to my room I would be staying in during my stay. Kudos on trying to freshen the place up but the strong smell of paint/gloss definately didn't go down too well and makes not drinking a bit more difficult when it's burning you to breathe. I understand that my admission time is not the time of my operation but over 4 hours later from being admitted to going for surgery.... Was thirsty work. Being told to drink plenty of fluid leading upto the op but then going 5 hours without a sip of water was harsh... Surely they knew roughly when I would be going to theatre and could change the time for my last water intake so I could have a drink to sooth the burn from the gloss. The op I think went well, not sure as I was sleeping.... But then coming round I was in agony and although I was telling them I was in pain and the pain was in my back and legs I was told \"yes you had surgery on your back\". This is the second time I have had this operation and knew this pain wasn't normal, I literally had to writhe in pain whilst trying to explain what was wrong a number of times before I was given any pain relief even though it was clear I was having bad muscle spasms in my legs and back causing the pain. On return to my room I was left until approx 8pm when I had to ask for somerhing to eat as it had been over 24 hours since I had eaten. Now don't get me wrong.... The food was dam nice... Just a shame I had to ask for it almost 2 hours afyer coming out of surgery. Then there was the room, the general area was clean and tidy but closer inspection showed a different story. And the bathroom was pretty dam drubby. There was tape over the seat saying \"sanitised for your protection\" or similar.... I'd day this same tape had been on there for a while, it was just grubby everywhere and not what I'd expect from a hospital.\n\nAs for the team, couldn't really fault them. All were pretty good. \nFinal point is that I was given a pack to take to my doctors for a dressing change but I was sent home in the same dressing that was applied after surgery, nobody checked my wound on discharge or changed the dressing that is covered in dry blood due to leakage or some sorts (so much so it bled through onto the bed sheets). Last time I had this op my wound was checked and dressing changed to a waterproof one so thst I could at least shower, right now I've gone 5 days with baby wipe \"showers\" and have had to book into my doctors earlier than asked so that I can get this disgusting dressing off and for them to check my wound.

It skipped a year last year presumably because of the Covid situation throughout 2020.  \r\nThe test showed that further examination was required and as a result I received an initial assessment by way of telephone call from Amanda at the Gemini suite located at the NDDH. As a result an appointment was made for me to attend at NDDH for a colonoscopy examination and as a result of the examination a large polyp was removed from my bowel. The biopsy result showed the poly had high risk cells present.  \r\nAs a result I attended the Gemini suite for a follow up colonoscopy. Three biopsy samples were taken from around the polyp removal site for examination and I am very pleased and relieved to say the results have proved to be negative.  \r\nI wish to thank Dr Davis and all the team at the Gemini suit, Cara, Tim, Rachel and Emma for their very caring and professional manner. I'm do apologise that I can't remember the names of all involved, the whole team are excellent.  \r\nI was totally placed at ease by all and at the end of the procedures a lovely cup of tea from suite manager Cara before discharge.  \r\nIt saddens me that the NHS comes under so much criticism at times especially from the press.

After some close care from the crisis mental health team she was eventually admitted to in patient psychiatric care in May.  \r\nConsidering the Covid status both locally and in the hospital, her care and management was very good overall. Whilst in hospital it became apparent that her house was not currently habitable - she is a hoarder and there was no clear sleeping facility and no cooking options. This was identified by the OT who was involved in assessing her. And whilst her psychosis was abating there were further issues becoming apparent i.e. she had some abnormalities on her CT scan of her brain and some clear cognitive impairment.  \r\nShe has been referred for further assessment by a psychiatrist with expertise in dementia in the young. To my knowledge, the ward staff referred her to social work in July in preparation for her going home. There was a patient who tested positive for Covid that week and so in patients were confined to their room. This not being ideal conditions for people recovering from psychiatric disorders, I was asked if I could accommodate her once she had completed her period of self isolation. I agreed to this for a period of 4 weeks reckoning that this would be enough time for social work to get in touch regarding her flat and for the further referral to investigate her cognitive impairment.  \r\nThat discharge was 4 weeks ago. Since that time both the crisis team and the discharge team have been in regular touch to ask about her mood and mental state, both of which are good but there has been no contact from anywhere else.  \r\nI have spent the last 6 weeks mostly by myself trying to make progress with emptying her flat and I am exhausted. She is staying with me and my husband and daughter, and we are doing our best to accommodate her but we need help. I have tried emailing the local dementia resource centre, but got no response. She is so clearly impaired but I have no way of helping her to progress towards getting home without help. The help required cannot be identified until she has a full assessment.  \r\nSo having had good emergency care for her organic psychosis, she is now not getting the support and assessment she needs to allow her to live as full a life as she can. And I have no indication of when we can expect to hear anything.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-08-19T20:42:14.4533333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-08-20T14:46:50.043","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Tayside","count":24},{"name":"Sheffield University Medical School 2021","count":1},{"name":"Scottish Recovery Network","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/871998","id":"871998"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/871998/responses","id":"871998"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/871998/healthservices","id":"871998"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/871998/tags","id":"871998"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/st9-community-services-community-mh","id":"st9-community-services-community-mh","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/t317h","id":"T317H","score":4},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/crisis","id":"crisis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/assessment","id":"assessment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cognitive%20impairment","id":"cognitive impairment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/community%20care","id":"community care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ct","id":"ct"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ct%20scan","id":"CT scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dementia","id":"dementia"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency","id":"emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency%20care","id":"emergency care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/exhausted","id":"exhausted"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good","id":"good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/inpatient%20care","id":"inpatient care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/isolation","id":"isolation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20good","id":"not good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ongoing%20support","id":"Ongoing support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/positive","id":"positive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scan","id":"scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid","id":"covid"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%2019","id":"covid 19"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20home","id":"at home"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mri%20brain%20scan","id":"mri brain scan"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/874705","id":"874705"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/874757","id":"874757"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/880792","id":"880792"}]},{"id":872013,"author":"Redhead66","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Pain management","body":"I waited 3 years to get an appointment with the pain clinic.

The wait on the ambulance is understandable and I appreciate how busy they are. The problem is that the ambulance crew had spoken on the phone to a Doctor from Monklands Hospital who had explained that the hospital was busy and they were struggling for beds and they don’t want him spreading covid to other patients, as my father caught covid last week (already had both vaccines). My fathers blood pressure was very low, he had hit his head during the fall (he had already fallen earlier in the week) and this time he sustained a head injury and could not feel his legs and was dizzy! ! I did not know any of this had happened until later this morning and was very upset and disgusted at the disregard for his safety, lack of care & compassion, lack of person centred, quality and equality of care from the Doctor who was calling from Monklands. Both my parents were scared, felt alone and abandoned. No one had checked his pupil size or reaction time/ neurological observations. He also had weakness in both legs. The Doctor at the other end of the telephone had not examined him before giving out advice and did not have any information about his neurological observations or action regarding his blood pressure. Also, despite my mother telling NHS 24 that my father had covid, it apparently had not been passed on to the ambulance crew. The ambulance crew using their good judgement were going to take my father to hospital for a proper examination and investigations. However, were advised not to by the Doctor from Monklands because he had covid and they were short on beds.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-08-19T16:06:56.5233333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-08-20T14:51:20.63","readBy":[{"name":"Scottish Ambulance Service","count":16},{"name":"NHS Lanarkshire","count":16},{"name":"North Lanarkshire Health & Social Care Partnership","count":1},{"name":"Partnership for Change","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/871965","id":"871965"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/871965/responses","id":"871965"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/871965/healthservices","id":"871965"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/871965/tags","id":"871965"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l106h_180","id":"L106H_180","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/scot-ambulance-emergency","id":"scot-ambulance-emergency","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/abandoned","id":"abandoned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disgusted","id":"disgusted"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scared","id":"scared"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/advice","id":"advice"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/alone","id":"alone"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ambulance%20crew","id":"ambulance crew"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood","id":"blood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20pressure","id":"blood pressure"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dizzy","id":"dizzy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctor","id":"doctor"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/elderly","id":"elderly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fall","id":"fall"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fell","id":"fell"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frail","id":"frail"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/head","id":"head"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/head%20injury","id":"head injury"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/injury","id":"injury"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lack%20of%20beds","id":"lack of beds"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lack%20of%20compassion","id":"lack of compassion"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/legs","id":"legs"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20good","id":"not good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting","id":"waiting"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/weakness","id":"weakness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassion","id":"compassion"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid","id":"covid"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%20restrictions","id":"covid restrictions"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%2019","id":"covid 19"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/872483","id":"872483"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/872690","id":"872690"}]},{"id":871971,"author":"Starhash","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"ENT appointment","body":"I was brought in for an urgent ent appointment at altnagelvin hospital.
