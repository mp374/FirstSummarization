My only recollection was of getting dressed at about 8:00am, and it appears I was preparing to walk the dog as she was wandering around with her coat on. A neighbour came to my door at about 11:30am as I had been missed at coffee that morning, and I managed to crawl and answer the door. She said that I was very confused and that I thought I was in the USA with my son, attending my daughter’s wedding - she lives in the US and has been married for over 20 years.  \r\nThe neighbour called my son and he contacted my GP surgery who advised him I should be taken to hospital. After having tests, x-rays and a scan, the diagnosis was a severe chest infection and I was told I would be allowed home, but, as I live alone the Dundee Enhanced Support Acute Team (DECS-A) would come in and take over my care. I was happy with this, alhough I had never heard of this team before.  \r\nA nurse and doctor arrived the following morning and they were very kind and explained that they would take over my medical care until they were happy that I was fully fit again. The nurse arranged to collect my prescription and she brought it back for me that afternoon and she came in every day until my antibiotics were finished and she was happy I was fully recovered.  \r\nI can never thank that team enough for what they did for me. I hadn’t even realised I was unwell and they just stepped in and helped me. A service like that, provided by such a professional team of medically qualified people, is worth it’s weight in gold, and must surely mean that people, who would otherwise have to stay in hospital, may be able to be cared for at home, and that’s where most of us would rather be.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-01-06T16:51:00.1","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-01-10T08:53:47.493","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Tayside","count":11}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1014937","id":"1014937"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1014937/responses","id":"1014937"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1014937/healthservices","id":"1014937"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1014937/tags","id":"1014937"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/t101h_180","id":"T101H_180","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/t107h-decsa","id":"T107H-DECSa","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/a&e","id":"a&e"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/antibiotics","id":"antibiotics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/chest%20infection","id":"chest infection"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctor","id":"doctor"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kind","id":"kind"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurse","id":"nurse"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professional","id":"professional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scan","id":"scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tests","id":"tests"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/x-rays","id":"x-rays"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happy","id":"happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported","id":"supported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/community%20support","id":"community support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/extremely%20satisfied","id":"extremely satisfied"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1016069","id":"1016069"}]},{"id":1014944,"author":"LizTr76","authorRoleId":3,"authorRole":"a parent/guardian","title":"My son's excellent care in hospital and at our local GP practice","body":"My son fell ill with flu in December 2022. After 6 days he was still very, very unwell. Our GP surgery (Linlithgow Group Medical Practice) amazingly saw him 3 days in a row (from day 6 of his illness) and started him speculatively on antibiotics even though they weren’t entirely sure what was wrong. On day 3 of visiting the GP, the doctor recognised that he had cellulitis in his eye socket and arranged for us to go to hospital as it can be very serious.  \r\nAt St John’s children’s ward (where we stayed overnight) we were treated so well. They were clearly busy but they were attentive and explained clearly what was needed. My son was also given some gorgeous Christmas gift toys to cheer him up which was so kind. The nurses also looked after me as I tried to calmly support him. He is a shy child but they made him feel comfortable enough to answer questions and he was able to sleep well for the first time in days.  \r\nThankfully because our GPs caught hi illness quickly and because of the prompt admission to St John’s and the care he received there, we only had to stay 24 hours in hospital. We are so grateful for all the care he received.He is rarely unwell and it was quite overwhelming but we were kindly looked after. Thankfully he’s made a full recovery.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-01-06T17:43:03.15","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-01-10T09:13:04.85","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lothian","count":12},{"name":"Scottish Government","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1014944","id":"1014944"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1014944/responses","id":"1014944"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1014944/healthservices","id":"1014944"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1014944/tags","id":"1014944"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/s308h_420","id":"S308H_420","score":5},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/ss9-general-practices","id":"SS9-general-practices","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scared","id":"scared"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/antibiotics","id":"antibiotics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/attentive","id":"attentive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cellulitis","id":"cellulitis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diagnosis","id":"diagnosis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/eye","id":"eye"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/flu","id":"flu"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gp","id":"GP"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kind","id":"kind"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kindness","id":"kindness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/looked%20after","id":"looked after"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/toys","id":"toys"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/well%20treated","id":"well treated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/explanations","id":"explanations"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/comfortable","id":"comfortable"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1017540","id":"1017540"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1017612","id":"1017612"}]},{"id":1014984,"author":"zebracz58","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"No confidence in A & E department","body":"Came to A&E with suspected Heart Attack, waited approximately 20mins for an ECG, had one earlier by a Paramedics.

I called the department yesterday for results and the phone was answered by one of the doctors, Paul. He explained he couldn’t find her results but would phone me back after he looked further. Paul phoned me back 15 minutes later to apologise that he couldn’t find my daughters results but asked how she was feeling now. I explained that she hadn’t improved but that she had not deteriorated. He asked if I’d be happy to bring her back to the department as he would rather she be checked over to see whether or not antibiotics would be needed to help her and I agreed so got ready to take her through.  \r\nWhen we arrived we checked in at reception and were triaged within 10 minutes by two lovely nurses who chatted away to my daughter to make her feel at ease and then took us through to a cubicle. Within 20 minutes of being in the cubicle, Donna, the nurse practitioner came to examine my daughter. She asked for a background of what had been going on and listened into her chest. Donna then explained what she found and recommended we try an inhaler to see if it improves my daughters chest and that once it had been given Donna would come back to check if it had helped.  \r\nBeth, one of the nurses then came to give the inhaler and, again, she was so lovely to my daughter who wasn’t impressed with the spacer! Donna then came back and informed me that the inhaler had really helped to clear up my daughters chest so recommended we go home with an inhaler and antibiotics. We have been in and out of St Johns A&E for the same reasons since my daughter was 9 weeks old and she is now 2. This is the first we have attended RHCYP and the team were prompt and thorough and explained everything I needed to know in detail and continuously put my mind at ease. I’m aware that services are extremely stretched right now but it never once impacted the care we received. We were in and out of A&E within 2 hours, including waiting on medication. Thank you to everyone for outstanding care.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-01-07T05:14:38.3033333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-01-10T10:13:27.933","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lothian","count":13}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1015201","id":"1015201"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1015201/responses","id":"1015201"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1015201/healthservices","id":"1015201"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1015201/tags","id":"1015201"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/s225h_180","id":"S225H_180","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/a&e","id":"a&e"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/antibiotics","id":"antibiotics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/chest","id":"chest"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/family%20support","id":"family support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/inhaler","id":"inhaler"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reception","id":"reception"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/results","id":"results"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/safe","id":"safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thoroughness","id":"thoroughness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/triage","id":"triage"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/well%20looked%20after","id":"well looked after"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20for","id":"cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/promptness","id":"promptness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/explanations","id":"explanations"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20at%20ease","id":"put at ease"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/listened%20to","id":"listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lovely%20nurses","id":"lovely nurses"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1015983","id":"1015983"}]},{"id":1015203,"author":"Sauce1","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Any one worried don’t be.","body":"Was very nervous before but the staff Senior Registrar (SR) Palmer and Janet were so friendly.

Surgical 2.  \r\nI was in over the Christmas period and just want to say that the staff in this ward are a group of angels!  \r\nI was bed bound and having been an active independent person to being totally dependent on someone for toileting and washing etc it was hard to accept but I was soon put at ease and nothing was to much trouble.  \r\nI was treated with respect and dignity throughout my stay. Everyone on the ward worked together as a team, helping each other out and ensuring all needs were catered for.  \r\nThe staff were ran off their feet but still kept smiling and caring... whether it be a cup of tea or medication and everything in between they were professional and attentive. It seemed to me that there was too heavy a workload for the one nurse in charge but they still managed to deliver an excellent level of care because that’s the type of people they are.  \r\nI think it’s really sad that these people are having to strike for better pay and conditions and sometimes feel undervalued when they are doing their best in a broken system.  \r\nI cannot recall all the names of auxiliaries and carers tending to me but I am so grateful to all of them… and to Ann and others who brought us tea and meals. Thanks especially to nurses Naomi, Aoife, Sheree and Mamsi for their care and attention.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-01-07T12:08:23.6633333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-01-10T10:29:09.92","readBy":[{"name":"Northern Health and Social Care Trust","count":4},{"name":"Public Health Agency","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1015253","id":"1015253"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1015253/responses","id":"1015253"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1015253/healthservices","id":"1015253"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1015253/tags","id":"1015253"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt002-ch-surgical-2","id":"zt002-ch-surgical-2","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/accident","id":"accident"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/attentive","id":"attentive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/busy","id":"busy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/car%20accident","id":"car accident"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care%20&%20attention","id":"Care & attention"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/carers","id":"Carers"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/caring","id":"caring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/catering%20staff","id":"catering staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cup%20of%20tea","id":"cup of tea"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dependent","id":"dependent"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/excellent%20care","id":"excellent care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/high%20workload","id":"high workload"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/level%20of%20care","id":"level of care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/more%20staff","id":"more staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professional","id":"professional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/respect","id":"respect"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/smiling","id":"smiling"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/taken%20care%20of","id":"taken care of"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/team%20work","id":"team work"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/toileting","id":"toileting"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/washing","id":"washing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dignity","id":"Dignity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/needs%20met","id":"needs met"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/auxilliaries","id":"auxilliaries"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20at%20ease","id":"put at ease"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/angels","id":"angels"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scans","id":"scans"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treated%20with%20dignity","id":"treated with dignity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treated%20with%20respect","id":"treated with respect"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nothing%20too%20much%20trouble","id":"nothing too much trouble"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1022555","id":"1022555"}]},{"id":1015270,"author":"Maggiemae","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"The service was excellent","body":"My Mastectomy was carried out by Ms Barker.

I spent just over a week in the hospital's Coronary Care Unit where the care I received there was sublime.  \r\nI was then moved to Fielding Ward for a week to continue my care and recovery. I wasn't impressed at all here.  \r\nTo start with the ward is cramped with little space to move around on A bay. The shower and toilet room is dirty and needs a thorough clean. Sadly the ward was riddled with COVID-19 infections during my time there and there was no encouragement from nursing staff for patients to wear surgical face coverings to avoid spreading. Subsequently, infected patients were regularly coughing and spluttering without covering their mouths. Nursing staff also wore face coverings nonchalantly, many having their noses exposed and didn't wear gloves when handing equipment to patients. 2 out of 6 beds had hand sanitising bottles attached too. No wonder the infections spread like wildfire.  \r\nSome, not all, nursing staff on this ward are very rude and disrespectful to patients. I witnessed the same nursing staff speak about patients in such a disrespectful and rude way to their colleagues, sometimes swearing and using hateful language. They would try to do this under their breath but doing this on the ward will, no doubt, be heard. I was shocked.  \r\nAdditionally, at mealtimes the same rude nursing staff would refuse to use the patient's name when speaking to them or about them to other colleagues and would refer to them as Bed A3 or Bed A6. I witnessed one nursing staff member order their colleague to ask bed 4 what they want for dessert, despite the fact that they were stood a meter away from the patient and could have politely asked them themselves. Awful. To me some of the HCA staff on Fielding Ward don't look like they want to be there. I saw some staff show very poor manners and approach to helping patients, particularly those who have complex needs.  \r\nI was so glad when the time came for me to be transferred away up to Bristol Royal Infirmary and get away from this tired, dirty ward.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-01-06T18:42:13.71","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2023-01-10T11:08:37.16","readBy":[{"name":"Somerset NHS Foundation Trust","count":3}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1014953","id":"1014953"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1014953/responses","id":"1014953"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1014953/healthservices","id":"1014953"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1014953/tags","id":"1014953"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rh5a8-320","id":"RH5A8-320","score":2},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scared","id":"scared"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cleanliness","id":"cleanliness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/coronary%20care","id":"coronary care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dirty","id":"dirty"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dirty%20wards","id":"Dirty wards"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disorganised","id":"disorganised"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disrespected","id":"disrespected"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disrespectful","id":"disrespectful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/face","id":"face"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fearful","id":"fearful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/food","id":"food"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hand","id":"hand"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/infected","id":"infected"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/infection%20control","id":"infection control"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/language","id":"language"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/rude%20staff","id":"rude staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attitude","id":"staff attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tachycardia","id":"tachycardia"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unwanted","id":"unwanted"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid","id":"covid"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%2019","id":"covid 19"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/infections","id":"infections"}]},{"id":1015276,"author":"Unknown27","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Long wait in A&E","body":"After not being able to see my own GP I was advised by an out of hours doctor to attend A&E so I made a visit to RVH.

We were informed that there was a 30 hour wait for a bed. My mum was poorly and in her late seventies - there was no way she could sit in a chair for 30 hours. I explained this to the receptionist and asked if we could wait for 8 of those 30 hours at home so at least she could lie down. The receptionist was so kind and asked the nurse in charge if they could find her a bed in minors, which she did. We were so grateful and my mum so needed to lie down. Pillows were like gold dust, but a lovely student nurse found us one to save my son a 50 mile round trip bringing one from home. I managed to find two blankets on a trolley so she was quite comfortable.  \r\nJust as I was about to leave, I perched on an office chair.

She kept me company and fed my baby bottles while I expressed in the middle of the night, and she reassured me when I was worried about my baby.

My mum was in severe discomfort but my cries for help were just ignored. I witnessed very little care, seeing patients asking for help, wanting the toilet but being ignored, call bells being ignored , staff saying I,ll come back shortly but often the patients wait a hour.  \r\nPatients left in dirty sheets with no staff to change, one day I got there at 1030 am and the lady opposite said no one had been near mum since 6 am, after complaining, a quick 5 minute wash and change was given to the mum and the lady in the opposite bed who would watch over mum was moved to the other side of the ward and replaced with a very poorly lady who just seemed to be left for hours on end.  \r\nSo distressing for me to watch, my mum was up and down during her stay got better, got worse, different doctors giving different updates, it was very confusing and not doing the tests she needed earlier enough for 5 days.  \r\nShe had chronic constipation and looked in severe discomfort and uncomfortable, just a truly heartbreaking experience for me and sad for mum who got excellent care respect and treated with dignity at home from the lovely care package we had in place. Obviously she has now passed away which admittedly was always a possibility but I sincerely think her last couple of weeks were heartbreaking for me I would have liked to see more compassion and interest and not be ignored the times I sat there.  \r\nJust to add it wasn't all bad, a couple of decent staff and a lovely coffee man who quite frankly brought a little cheer into those two horrific weeks, I spent Christmas Day Boxing Day by my mums side with no one hardly speaking to me the nurse did their jobs like robots, medication observations and many a time the health care staff, I saw some sat at reception playing on mobiles and eating crisps and chocolate biscuits, all this is fact and I have witnesses who sat with their families just as shocked so sad.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-01-09T11:54:41.5633333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-01-10T12:17:40.37","readBy":[{"name":"Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust","count":3},{"name":"The Stroke Association","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1015581","id":"1015581"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1015581/responses","id":"1015581"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1015581/healthservices","id":"1015581"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1015581/tags","id":"1015581"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/r0a07_430","id":"R0A07_430","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confused","id":"confused"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/distressing","id":"distressing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ignored","id":"ignored"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20listened%20to","id":"not listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/alzheimers","id":"alzheimers"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/coffee","id":"coffee"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/constipation","id":"constipation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/end%20of%20life","id":"end of life"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/heartbroken","id":"heartbroken"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/neglect","id":"neglect"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/no%20help","id":"no help"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/passed%20away","id":"passed away"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/personal%20care","id":"personal care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stroke","id":"stroke"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting","id":"waiting"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassion","id":"compassion"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unclear%20information","id":"Unclear information"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bedridden","id":"bedridden"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dignity%20in%20dying","id":"dignity in dying"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting%20in%20discomfort","id":"waiting in discomfort"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20treated","id":"not treated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dirty%20sheets","id":"dirty sheets"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1020961","id":"1020961"}]},{"id":1012365,"author":"SDifolco","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Concerns listened to","body":"Was let down by my GP surgery following a disappointing appointment with the mental health nurse, I felt they didn't listen to me and fobbed my concerns off as I was under addictions.  \r\nMy named nurse organised an appointment quickly for me with Addictions services and the doctor was amazing.

I was very impressed at how professional, friendly and caring all of the staff that saw us were. I felt they were very thorough and thoughtful while looking after my baby, as well as being kind and supportive to my nervous older child, even offering him an ice lolly and a bed to rest on.  \r\nI was only in a few hours for a swab and some observations for my little one, but I just wanted to say how positive an experience it was, when I had thought it would be otherwise.

I had to check at on the ground floor at the A&E reception and the woman checking me in wished me a speedy recovery and was hopeful my operation went well.

After my surgery was taken back to the ward and given tea and toast which was delicious. I was then able to mobilise with the help of the physiotherapist who was very encouraging.

What I was not expecting was rude and very uncaring staff, from the reception desk to the nursing staff. I was triaged after an hour and was told I would have to wait about 4 hours to be seen. I sat and waited on the most uncomfortable metal chair ever, in a freezing waiting room for 8 hours, I was alone, in pain and nobody came to check on me but I also did not go to the door to complain, which most other people did on a regular basis.  \r\nWhen I was taken into the department I was really feeling unwell and my knee was in severe pain, obviously sitting for 8 hours did not help. I asked the nurse who took me in and asked me to get on the trolley if I could have a pillow for under my knee, was told bluntly they don’t have any, and did not offer me anything else. They took bloods and vital signs and left the cubicle, I remained there for 4 hours and they never came back again. After this two doctors came to see me, who were much more caring and understanding and at least apologetic for the circumstances. I was taken for an X-ray and a very kind radiographer did put a pillow under my knee to help relive my pain. I was then transferred by trolley up to ward 23.  \r\nI will again accept that there is a huge demand on services currently and the ward was short staffed, but that is no excuse for some of the behaviour I witnessed by the nursing staff. I will also clarify this is not all the staff but too many were rude, and uncaring to other patients and myself. This is my 3rd admission to hospital in less than 2 years and the other two have been very positive experiences. I have to say this one was not, it was quite horrible, patients who were bed bound were being reprimanded for ringing their buzzers? I could list many examples.  \r\nWhen I was told the following morning I would have to stay in longer I was devastated and I do not think I could cope with the behaviour I was witnessing. I will point out now that I am a nurse of over 40 years experience and I was shocked at the care I was witnessing. I would say the worst thing that was said to me was that I had, in one nurses option, a low pain threshold. I would like to know how they know and have they any idea how painful a knee is after 7 days post op with complications, as until then I did not?  \r\nAgain it was not all negative, myself and fellow patients noted a huge improvement in nursing care when the night staff came on and my consultant who discharged me the following day was fantastic. I really hate to say this as a nurse as my main complaint has to be about the nursing staff not the rest of the team and being short staffed is no excuse ever.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-01-08T14:09:40.7933333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-01-10T13:24:34.393","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":14}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1015442","id":"1015442"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1015442/responses","id":"1015442"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1015442/healthservices","id":"1015442"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1015442/tags","id":"1015442"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/c418h_110","id":"C418H_110","score":2},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/c418h_180","id":"C418H_180","score":3},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/neglected","id":"neglected"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/uncaring","id":"uncaring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/a&e","id":"a&e"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/chairs","id":"chairs"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/consultant","id":"consultant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/devastated","id":"devastated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency","id":"emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/knee%20replacement","id":"knee replacement"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/miserable","id":"miserable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/night%20staff","id":"night staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nursing%20care","id":"nursing care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/radiographer","id":"radiographer"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reception","id":"reception"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/rudeness","id":"rudeness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/severe%20pain","id":"severe pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/some%20staff","id":"some staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/temperature","id":"temperature"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting%20time","id":"waiting time"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/x%20ray","id":"x ray"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fantastic","id":"fantastic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/uncaring%20staff","id":"uncaring staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/some%20nursing%20staff","id":"some nursing staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20shortages","id":"staff shortages"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/regular%20checks","id":"regular checks"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1016063","id":"1016063"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1016079","id":"1016079"}]},{"id":1016028,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Doing well","body":"I have been trying \nfor two months  to get a face to face appointment with this specific doctor as I knew my history was familiar to this doctor. \nIn the end I managed it with help\nand was very happy with the outcome. \nHowever the two week window for making face to face appointments with a specific doctor  is very frustrating.

Diane had the patter, she was reassuring and knowledgeable. I watched as she looked after the 5 of us that were waiting for our operations and the care she showed to each and everyone of us to make sure we were all comfortable listening to us and seemed really interested in what we had to say and any concerns we had.  \r\nThe whole department ran like a well oiled machine from the receptionist through to the operating team all were professional kind and experienced. Sorry I can’t remember all your names.  \r\nThe NHS is taking a battering right now and we the public need to fight for the future of our NHS. We need to highlight more and more all the excellent work that they do on a daily basis. Does it need fixing, of course it does but there are amazing people who work there that all they want to do is care for people the best they can, and sadly are in a position that they can’t offer the

NHS24 was extremely busy and was on hold for 2 hours before I spoke to a call handler, who was very understanding of my call and spoke to the nurse at NHS24, who advised that they would like a Dr to phone me back due to symptoms and current situation.  \r\nA doctor phoned me back. They were very understanding and showed compassion towards my situation, which was a very stressful time due to covid, Immuno-compromised and also 9 weeks pregnant. Due to the symptoms I was experiencing, this doctor wanted me to speak to a consultant from the covid department and ensure antiviral treatments were safe during pregnancy. They asked me to call the Hub in the morning due to public holiday and time this evening.  \r\nThe doctor phoned me again to see how I was, and to ask if I had spoken to consultant yet. I can’t thank this doctor enough for how they dealt with this situation and care and compassion showed towards me at such a stressful time. A Dr from Covid helpline called me back. They didn’t realise I was pregnant as they were going through a questionnaire for antiviral medication. I was advised that treatment was very different when pregnant. Dr asked me how I knew I was pregnant, which I advised I had taken a early pregnancy test and was nearly 9 weeks pregnant at this point. Dr advised that they were going to speak to an obstetrician and phoned me back.When this Dr from the Covid helpline phoned me back they were then talking about how things can naturally terminate, and also asked me if I could go and take a pregnancy test to see if it’s positive or negative, as if it’s negative they would be able to prescribe antiviral medications. I explained that I was definitely pregnant as I had been for a private scan as well to prove this. I said to this Dr that I am sorry to interrupt but I hope I am still pregnant, to which the Dr said they congratulate me on this.The obstetrician referred me to have a scan to validate my pregnancy. Due to speaking to this consultant, I was very nervous after conversation. I was told this day that I was having a silent miscarriage and lost my baby 3 weeks ago. I found the Dr from the covid line to be very inappropriate saying statements in this sense when a women is very early pregnant and is aware that miscarriage happens but to add additional stress on when already having a stressful and upsetting time and panicking because of current situation. I don’t feel like this was dealt with appropriately and after phone call with this Dr, I was upset and annoyed. I felt like I had to tell my story so this Dr acknowledges how they dealt with my situation and doesn’t cause other pregnant women to worry and anxiety that is unnecessary.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-01-06T12:12:36.33","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-01-10T14:03:54.973","readBy":[{"name":"NHS 24","count":27},{"name":"NHS Lanarkshire","count":8}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1014851","id":"1014851"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1014851/responses","id":"1014851"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1014851/healthservices","id":"1014851"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1014851/tags","id":"1014851"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l308h_501","id":"L308H_501","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/nhs24_c19hl","id":"NHS24_C19HL","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sl9-gp-out-of-hours","id":"SL9-GP-out-of-hours","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxious","id":"anxious"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/call%20handler","id":"call handler"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/early%20pregnancy","id":"early pregnancy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/empathy","id":"empathy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/immunocompromised","id":"immunocompromised"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/miscarriage","id":"miscarriage"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nhs111","id":"NHS111"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurse","id":"nurse"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/obstetrician","id":"obstetrician"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/on%20call%20doctor","id":"on call doctor"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/understanding","id":"understanding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassion","id":"compassion"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nhs111%20in%20dealing%20with%20my%20call","id":"nhs111 in dealing with my call"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/called%20back","id":"called back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%2019","id":"covid 19"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/antiviral","id":"antiviral"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1016663","id":"1016663"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1017613","id":"1017613"}]},{"id":1016050,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Excellent care","body":"I attended Boothroyd Day Centre to have a lump removed under general anaesthetic.
