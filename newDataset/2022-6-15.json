I was very unwell at the time with cough, fever, vomiting, diarrhoea, fatigue, decreased oxygen levels not to mention the headaches and loss of taste and smell. My family called for help on two occasions due to low sats rates. On the second occasion they came out to me but my sats just started improving at that stage so they left me stay home. The hospitals at this time were extremely busy.  \r\nLuckily for me I started to turn a corner on day 11 and started to improve.  \r\nHowever my cough went on for months and I had give courses of antibiotics. My headaches also lasted for a long time nearly a year. My breathing was very irregular.  \r\nIn March 2020 the GP referred me to the Long Covid clinic I think I got my first appointment in August. This was a life saver for me as they diagnosed me with long covid and referred me to the Occupational Therapist and to the Fatigue clinic. I felt i was not alone anymore and more importantly i was believed.  \r\nProbably about September I had my first appointment with Carina my occupational therapist. She understood what I was saying and believed me about my fatigue and all the other problems I was having as a result of my immune system. She agreed I still wasn’t fit for work but came up with a plan that I could give to my employer when I was better.  \r\nI was also referred to the Respiratory Physiotherapist and seen in October to March this year. My breathing pattern was very irregular and this was adding to my fatigue. After five months he taught me how to breath correctly and be aware of my breathing. During this time I also had very regular appointments with Evelyn in the Fatigue clinic. She was amazing and again believed in me. She taught me how to pace myself and to learn to know when I needed to stop to allow myself to recover. She was extremely patient with me and I felt better after each session knowing that I wasn’t just imagining this fatigue,  \r\nAll of these people put together were a God send. I think I would still be struggling much more now without each and everyone of them. I still need to stop and get very tired but they have taught me how to manage this. I am now working full time but from home.

The staff made the unpleasant treatment of chemo bearable. Nothing was too much trouble, you feel the staff really care about patients and the atmosphere is happy despite the difficulties of cancer throws at them. Even more amazing is this treatment was done during a pandemic!! Staff rose to the challenge and hygiene was impeccable at all times in all sections of the day unit.

It was an absolute disgrace, dumped in the corridor on a chair and left. Those chairs are not designed to be sat on for 6 hours at a time, you wouldn't allow your admin staff not to have ergonomic chairs, so why is it ok for your patients especially when your leaving them for hours? My body was so tired from the infection that I had to make a make shift bed on your chairs using my backpack.  \r\nFinally at 02:30 in the morning after arriving at approximately 20:30/21:00, I got to see the doctor, and fortunately the story gets better. The doctors were fantastic and immediately got me sorted and got me onto some IV antibiotics and fluids.  \r\nSo at approx 07:00 I was moved into another part of the department where it was quiet for which I was thankful for.  \r\nThe consultant visited me at approx 08:00 and asked me what I wished to do regards further treatment as I was responding well to the antibiotics. They stated that I could stay in A&E, run another bag of antibiotics and fluids and then be discharge me home, or alternatively go up to the ward and spend a a bit more time with some more antibiotics etc.  \r\nI elected for staying in A&E. A short while later, no more than 5 minutes or so, a porter arrived to take me up to the ward, I explained what I'd discussed with the consultant and the nurse then sent the porter away. Another 5 mins passed and another porter arrived and the decision had been made by whoever looks after beds in the dept that I should be going up the ward as there is a bed reserved for me up there. Fair enough I thought but why ask me in that case?  \r\nSo, I get up to ward B12 and the show continues. The bed that was reserved me didn't exist - they didn't have a bed for me and weren't expecting me. I was then popped by the window - again no welfare checks other than the receptionist who was lovely. No obs done, no offer of pain relief, I was left to my own devices between approx 09:00 and 12:00.  \r\nI eventually approached a staff nurse and stated what the consultant had said about me just needing some IV drugs and then I can go home. I stated that if a bed is not possible please just treat me in the corridor but at least treat me and not ignore me just because there's no bed. I feel this is a basic failure in their duty of care, not to mention my dignity and mental health. Being left staring at a wall for 3 hours and ignored could be deemed a form of torture. I know that sounds dramatic and the standard reply of its not our intention etc but the fact is that this is what happened to me and at times that's how it made me feel. I would rather be at home in extreme pain but at least my family would acknowledge me unlike the staff did both in A&E and on ward.  \r\nI now write this at 12:16 and I am finally in the room that has been made available for me which I am grateful for, but what a performance. I understand the NHS is under extreme pressure and I truly sympathise but when performance gets to this point, you've hit crisis point, close the doors and send them to another hospital. I can't provide feedback on the remainder of my stay but I think this is quite enough for you to review.  \r\nMany thanks for reading!","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-06-13T11:22:59.5133333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-06-15T09:34:16.713","readBy":[{"name":"Scottish Ambulance Service","count":7},{"name":"NHS Forth Valley","count":6},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2022)","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/946840","id":"946840"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/946840/responses","id":"946840"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/946840/healthservices","id":"946840"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/946840/tags","id":"946840"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/forth-valley-royal-ae","id":"forth-valley-royal-ae","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/forth-valley-royal-surgical-assessment","id":"forth-valley-royal-surgical-assessment","score":1},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/scot-ambulance-emergency","id":"scot-ambulance-emergency","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20cared%20for","id":"not cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/accident%20&%20emergency","id":"accident & emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/beds","id":"beds"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/chairs","id":"chairs"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/decison%20making","id":"decison making"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/demoralised","id":"demoralised"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/desperate","id":"desperate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctors","id":"doctors"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/facilities","id":"facilities"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/felt%20ignored","id":"felt ignored"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/infection","id":"infection"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/iv%20antibiotics","id":"iv antibiotics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/long%20wait","id":"long wait"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain%20relief","id":"pain relief"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/paramedics","id":"paramedics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/receptionist","id":"receptionist"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tonsillitis","id":"tonsillitis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/observations","id":"observations"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/checks","id":"checks"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/like%20a%20number","id":"like a number"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tired","id":"tired"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/forgotten%20about","id":"forgotten about"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/quiet%20ward","id":"quiet ward"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20kept%20updated","id":"not kept updated"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/947646","id":"947646"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/947676","id":"947676"}]},{"id":947649,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Great staff but in crisis","body":"I don’t understand why there is such a shortage of GP’s nationally but it’s clear that this practice is in crisis.

All the staff and the GP’s are superb when you can reach them and have been great helping with my parents. Have you thought of grading patients according to their circumstances for example my father has ongoing health issues and at 86 really needs to be looked after by 1 or 2 specific GP’s who can then treat him better. I never see the GP twice anymore so they don’t understand my whole situation or else they have to take extra time to figure it out. \nThank you for what you are able to do and I hope nationally something will be done as currently it’s impossible to get help and support when you need it.

They make what could be a very hard and difficult day, very relaxing and fun.  \r\nI always have terrible trouble getting blood tests done because I have such difficult veins. Only last week I had 4 different nurses and doctors make 9 attempts before successfully getting enough blood to do the tests, I find that incredibly stressful and can feel very faint from it. Juvy couldn't find a good vein to start and very calmly went and got me a heat pack to improve the blood flow, came back in 10 mins once I'd heated up and got the cannula in first attempt. A completely stress free experience. This puts me at ease from the outset. This is the same every time at the medical day case unit, very experienced nurses who are brilliant at what they do and have such lovely and sincere patient care.  \r\nJuvy, Diane and Danielle all tended to me during the day and were all lovely. I'm definitely missing some names but all the staff were brilliant. The guy who brings around the tea and coffee trolley is always really pleasant and has a bit of craic with everyone when he comes in too.  \r\nIf all areas of my care were like the service I get in medical day case, I would be a very happy girl.  \r\nThank you to all the staff","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-06-13T11:39:52.8633333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-06-15T09:39:40.72","readBy":[{"name":"South Eastern Health and Social Care Trust","count":3}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/946843","id":"946843"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/946843/responses","id":"946843"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/946843/healthservices","id":"946843"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/946843/tags","id":"946843"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt004_07021-mdcu","id":"zt004_07021-mdcu","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing%20staff","id":"amazing staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood","id":"blood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20tests","id":"blood tests"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/experienced%20staff","id":"experienced staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/informative","id":"informative"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pleasant","id":"pleasant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sincerity","id":"sincerity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tests","id":"tests"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/veins","id":"veins"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/warm","id":"warm"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/welcoming","id":"welcoming"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/well%20looked%20after","id":"well looked after"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happy","id":"happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/relaxed","id":"relaxed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sincere","id":"sincere"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tea%20and%20coffee","id":"tea and coffee"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stress%20free","id":"stress free"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20at%20ease","id":"put at ease"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fine","id":"fine"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/948963","id":"948963"}]},{"id":947648,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Politeness doesn't cost anything.","body":"I have had to visit the surgery twice in the last week and both times I have got into my car in tears just due to the rudeness of the receptionists.

Practitioner didn't know why I had been referred or who had made the referral inspite of all the questionnaires I had filled in previously and which had obviously not been read. From the outset this didn't exactly make for a warm welcome. I was also asked what I wanted to do in the session which left me absolutely astonished because I thought that direction would come from the trained health professional. Bit like the doctor asking a patient what they d like to have a go at when they walk into the surgery !! I m afraid I m not an expert in mental health  and don't know how to fix myself which is why I signed up for therapy in the first place. If I knew how to fix myself I wouldn't be here. Practitioner said couldn't help even though I was obviously distressed and said would refer me to another department. Got back to me later and said I didn't fit the criteria so would refer me for screening and if the counselling department couldn't help I would be sent back to the original practitioner and they would then help me. Just another time and money wasting NHS shambles. I absolutely fail to understand (and it was not explained to me) why this first Practitioner couldn't help me first time round but would suddenly miraculously be able to help me if I went round the departmental loop first and was rejected. It's a shambles and I am even more depressed now than before the appointment which has left me high and dry. Meanwhile I continue to get no support for a long term health condition that affects my mental health and vastly reduces my ability to work.

She also became less responsive, vomiting and had diarrhoea. (She is a poor wee soul). The staff on the ward were nothing but amazing to both my mum and I. Nothing was a problem both when I visited and when I phoned .  \r\nMy mum can’t do anything for herself now requiring maximum assistance. My mum was spotlessly clean and as her condition allowed had been given drinks and food.  \r\nUnfortunately some tough decisions had to be made for my mum and the consultant on the ward spent time with me on a few occasions explaining and comforting me when I got upset. He came to speak to me about my mum and lifted a glass of water in my mum's room and while chatting to me proceeded to give my mum sips of the water. Very touching.  \r\nSometimes people who have dementia get brushed to the side and forgotten. He took time to do this for my mum while talking to her and explain things to me.  \r\nUnfortunately while my mum was in the ward I tested positive for covid 19. I was distraught as the decisions made meant that my mum is now for palliative care only so to then not to be able to visit her was terrible. The only way I could get updates was by phone. The staff on the phone were fantastic, understanding my circumstances.  \r\nPeople are all too ready to complain when things are not to their liking.

So I was glad to be given a space in the day centre having recently completed my 12 week block- it has been a godsend.  \r\nI am a young adult so I was slightly apprehensive about going into a group with mainly people who were older adults but this did not disadvantage me at all. Carol, Roxanne and especially Lee are such caring welcoming and knowledgeable nursing staff who checked in on my well-being and that of group members and kept things ticking on. They are solution focused and thinking how to help if anyone had been unwell or in pain, making quick links to other staff.  \r\nAs Covid eased it was also good to see other staff drop into sessions like OH and Physio who provided some stretching and advice. Each session started with a talk from a guest speaker on a range of topics e.g. pastoral care, writer, Nutritionist, pharmacist, physio etc and although I was familiar with many of these services each time I learnt something new or considered something different.  \r\nThis was followed by a relaxation session- Kerry is amazing- such a calm and considerate person thinking about the whole person and offering advice and tips to encourage relaxation out with sessions. Kerry led a half hour guided relaxation which always helped me relax and sometimes let out a wee snore.  \r\nActually I am hoping she does a podcast soon 😆 Kerry also gave me foot massages as an inpatient this additional layer of holistic care definitely aided my recovery.  \r\nThen we have Donna and Niel the in-house artists. They made the group for me! I am not in anyway arty and actually scoffed at the idea on week one but with their support and encouragement I got into splatter painting and was delighted to leave with many pieces of art for myself and family and friends. Nothing was ever too much for Donna and Neil and they are so passionate about everyone having a creative flare and helping you find yours. Also just there general chit chat and listening to their knowledge of general arty things really left me upbeat as well as covered in paint.  \r\nAll in all the Roxburgh experience at day centre has been hugely positive for me in my mental, emotional and physical health although I have a terminal condition they have boosted my confidence in my new normal and found skills I didn’t even know I had. These relationships and being in the building and asking questions that might feel uncomfortable to other health staff in other settings has reassured me that if my health is to change or need assistance they are there and I can be confident in the care to expect as both an in and out patient  \r\nIt’s a pity that more people don’t know about the day centre particular those in a younger age bracket as I’m sure it could be filled multiple times over and each person would feel the benefits.  \r\nThanks to all involved in making the day centre what it is.. a calm, encouraging, supportive, safe and person centred environment for all","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-06-13T13:30:51.7333333","progress":"Story has a

One nurse in particular who sorted my IV drip (I believe her name was Laura, she is a newly qualified nurse according to her lanyard) was beyond amazing. She was so kind, calm and patient. I observed more than one patient be rude to her complaining about having to wait for a while and she very patiently reassured them, apologised and explained the waits. She was working under extreme pressure due to the volume of patients and is a credit to her profession. There was another female nurse too who was also lovely and helpful.

When we arrived that day I let staff know immediately that my daughter had a rash which resembled chickenpox. We were then shown to the waiting area.. It is my understanding that a nurse made the doctor aware and my daughter and I continued sitting in the waiting room.  \r\nAfter 20-30 minutes of waiting my daughter and I were lead to a clinician’s room. Within a few minutes, a staff member entered the room and they appeared extremely angry. They began shouting at me for bringing my daughter to an appointment with suspected chickenpox. I explained, I made staff aware at the first opportunity. The staff member continued to shout aggressively and made me feel incredibly vulnerable. I asked them not to shout at me, particularly in front of my then 10 year old daughter. At one point they mocked me and laughed when I tried to explain myself. I repeatedly asked not to be spoken to that way, especially when my daughter was there. I was deeply concerned about the impact this had on her. I could see how uncomfortable and worried she had become. We couldn’t get past the staff member to leave as we were inside the room and they were by the doorway.  \r\nThey ignored my requests and continued about the contagiousness of chickenpox and how harmful my actions were to staff. I then realised that they were not wearing a mask to protect us from COVID. I was told they would see a child with COVID before seeing a child with chickenpox. To this day, I remain shocked by this bold statement.  \r\nI had no idea who this staff member was so I asked the nurse their name. I was informed my daughter wouldn’t be allowed to attend her appointment. I left the building shaking and crying to return to my car.  \r\nWe sat in the car whilst I tried ringing my husband to explain what had happened and ask for advice on what to do next. Whilst on the phone, I realised this staff member had followed us outside and was standing next to my car. I put down the window and explained my disgust at their behaviour and how inappropriate it had been. I couldn’t believe how I’d be spoken to by a healthcare professional.  \r\nThey continued to explain the seriousness of chickenpox and how children with terminal illnesses attend appointments in the building. I explained that they could have approached the situation in an entirely different way. We should have been kindly asked to leave the building and offered an appointment at a later date.  \r\nI was then encouraged to attend the appointment without my daughter and offered for staff to check on my daughter whilst she sat in the car. The alternative option was for someone else to ring me and discuss via telephone. I decided on attending the appointment face-to-face, in hindsight I wish I had of asked for an alternative date to attend as my mind remained focused on how my daughter was feeling after this outburst.  \r\nI found this appointment extremely difficult as I was shaking as a result of this person's behaviour. The Doctor I saw was very pleasant. I shared details of my daughters medial history and the main reasons for my daughters re-referral to the Education Authority. I specifically asked that a condition that was recorded on the medical report. I shared photographs of my daughters skin given that she had to wait in the car. It was important to me that the Education Authority and school were fully informed.  \r\nMuch to my disappointment, there was no reference of my daughters repeated diagnosis of this condition despite my request. The only reference regarding my daughters skin difficulties was general eczema with no explanation on the severity  \r\nI believe my daughter was let down by community paediatrics as missing this diagnosis has led to additional stress.  \r\nIt was decided that a re-referral to community paediatrics for a face-to-face appointment would be the best way forward, considering the refusal to allow my daughters access to her appointment in late 2020. It was my hope that a new appointment would have given me the chance to talk about my daughters current medical history.  \r\nI recently discovered my daughter wasn’t issued with a face-to-face appointment, however, another paediatrician has viewed her medical notes and decided that there is no additional information to add without any contact with myself or seeing my daughter.  \r\nI cannot express the level of upset and frustration I have felt as a result of the community paediatric department since 2020. My daughter and I have been deeply affected by the behaviour of this staff member. I do acknowledge that they made contact with me the following day to apologise for their behaviour. My daughter has been left feeling even more ashamed of her skin problems and remains concerned that she may make others unwell when a new rash appears given this staff member's reaction.  \r\nI have genuine concerns about speaking up due to any repercussions as a result of this care opinion and how it may affect my daughters care going forward.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-06-08T23:11:14.2366667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-06-15T13:42:03.877","readBy":[{"name":"Western Health and Social Care Trust","count":5},{"name":"Public Health Agency","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/945779","id":"945779"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/945779/responses","id":"945779"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/945779/healthservices","id":"945779"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/945779/tags","id":"945779"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt005_45020_420","id":"ZT005_45020_420","score":1},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anger","id":"anger"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disappointed","id":"disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/attitude","id":"attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/eczema","id":"eczema"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/paediatric","id":"paediatric"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/paediatrics","id":"paediatrics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/skin","id":"skin"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mocked","id":"mocked"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/spoken%20over","id":"spoken over"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid","id":"covid"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%2019","id":"covid 19"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/947761","id":"947761"}]}]
