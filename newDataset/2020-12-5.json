An experience. You are at the mercy of whichever doctor is on triage, and can be left without help if you aren't very good at communicating your issues. Routine appointment times tend to be about 2 weeks for telephone, or 3-4 for face-to-face (pre-pandemic). \nI have found the nurses have always been absolutely fantastic, caring and helpful, as well as professional and quick with routine things like blood tests. \nMy experience with the doctors has been both good and bad at times, I find generally there is a strong focus on treatment rather than diagnosis, which can be hurtful rather than helpful at times. However, I have a suspicion that this issue may be more of a national problem rather than this particular surgery's. Some doctors here have better \"bedside manner\" (or chair side, I suppose!) than others, which can have a considerable effect if you need to talk about particularly personal issues.\nI have found that they have coped well with the pandemic without the quality of care getting worse, which is impressive.

I phoned my doctor regarding a mole on my back, due to family history I was given a link to send photos to a mobile phone app. These were assessed and a consultant phoned me and asked me to come to the clinic. This was only 2 days later on a Saturday morning. I work for the FCO and was due to fly on the Wednesday morning. I had to cancel my flight as the consultant stated the mole needed to come off and a lymph node scanning . \nOn the Monday morning a telephonist offered me a cancellation slot for the Tuesday afternoon which I accepted. I had two moles removed, the consultant used dissolving stitches as I work in Mogadishu and would have issues getting the stitches taken out. \nThe following Friday I received an appointment for the lymph node ultrasound which I attended and was informed everything was okay and I had no issues to worry about!\n\nI am amazed at the speed of the whole process; especially during the COVID pandemic and the wanted to express my gratitude to all concerned for their dedication and friendly and efficient manner. \n\nAll we usually hear is how bad something is within the NHS, and you never get much positive feedback, so I felt compelled to write and express my thanks to all concerned.\n\nRegards\n\nJohn Crouch","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-12-05T15:34:51","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-12-05T20:33:36","readBy":[{"name":"East Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/808558","id":"808558"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/808558/responses","id":"808558"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/808558/healthservices","id":"808558"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/808558/tags","id":"808558"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rxc","id":"RXC","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/crisis","id":"crisis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazed","id":"amazed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/concerned","id":"concerned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dermatology","id":"dermatology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mole","id":"mole"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/positive","id":"positive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/speed","id":"speed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stitches","id":"stitches"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ultrasound","id":"ultrasound"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20concerned","id":"very concerned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gratitude","id":"gratitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/impressed","id":"impressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thanks","id":"thanks"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/809253","id":"809253"}]},{"id":808567,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Dermatologist ","body":"Was seen on time, staff really good.
