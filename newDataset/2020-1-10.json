First visit I was in and out within 90 minutes, and I received excellent advice and attention with advice as to what to do if things do not improve. I came as more of a walk in patient as the surgery was closed on Saturday.\nI went back on Wednesday as instructed as there was no change. I waited about two hours but once seen I was given blood tests cannula and everything I needed. I left just over three hours after arrival with an appointment for 7am yesterday to come to SAU for surgery.\nOn arrival the night staff were still in situ and the waiting room was empty. I was advised that the surgery originally booked for 8am would be slightly delayed but was kept informed all along the way. The night sister came and personally wished me good luck today using my first name as she left for the day. I have worked nights and yours are long, that was so appreciated, kind,she didn't have to do that but she did and it instilled confidence that everyone knew what was going on. \nI received excellent attention from the day staff, was prepared well, by the nursing staff, anaesthetist,porter who wheeled me to surgery.\nIt was a small op only 30 minutes asleep and in recovery all of the staff were so kind and attentive. By 11.30 I had been taken back to the surgical unit from theatre. Had enjoyed a sandwich and a coffee, and they had called my husband to collect me. \nDischarge papers were ready and extra interim dressings etc. I was in the car on the way home before noon.\nI can be quick to complain and generally I do not suffer fools gladly but please believe me when I say the service, care and kindness I experience was exemplary. Thank you so much. Thank you A&E. Thank you SAU. Thank you to the anaesthetist . Thank you to the consultant, for your easy way despite the heavy load I gave you. Thank you theatre staff and recovery staff and everyone on the surgical unit first floor. Each and every one of you were excellent. \nThe NHS are fantastic, a resource that cannot be underestimated in terms of value to all.

We accept there was a shortage of beds but nobody offered my mom a drink or anything to eat during all these hours and this we find totally unacceptable. Also nobody kept us informed of what was happening at all. There seemed to be a total lack of communication. Also when she actually moved into a proper ward she had not even been given her usual medications which were strong pain relief and anxiety tablets although we had said that she needs them. This is also unacceptable. We were told that the staff could not administer them as they had not been prescribed by the hospital. This is so wrong as our mom was in severe pain and very anxious and really needed her medication. This was eventually sorted out but why should she have had to suffer the pain and anxiety for so long I even offered to administer them myself but was told I couldn't. Just seems so wrong to let someone suffer so much when there was no need. The medication was prescribed by our moms own gp after all.

Not everyone will sit for over an hour in pain, and the surgery is failing it's patients.\nMaybe if the NHS worked on a paid per patient system, the GPs might arrive at the surgery on time, as is expected of patients, and also, stick to the allocated appointment time limits.\nHow can a surgery that opens 9am, by 10am, already be behind 25min, then increasing to an hour??\nBefore GPs demand wage rises, maybe they should be lower paid in reflection of their performance. \nBecause these two surgeries are not performing to the public, and it's been like this for 15yr at least.\nAppauling","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-01-06T11:14:21","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2020-01-10T10:27:54","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/729850","id":"729850"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/729850/responses","id":"729850"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/729850/healthservices","id":"729850"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/729850/tags","id":"729850"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/c86013","id":"C86013","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"}]},{"id":729849,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Residential Care Home","body":"We are a Residential Care Home which the practice visits, we have a great relationship with all at the practice.

I was not seen promptly and was told to wait by the receptionist due to the large amount of people wanting to be seen. \n\nIn the end in a state of panic and feeling severely unwell I ended up leaving and calling an ambulance on myself.

I then got to Kings College and was diagnosed with a viral infection that spread to my face and lower body and remained there for the duration of two weeks.  \n\nI work for the NHS for 10 years and being treated like this really disappointed me as I felt there was no compassion, organisation and lack of empathy for each patient. \nI work for Guy’s and St Thomas Hospital and I couldn’t quite believe that the staff at Deptford surgery/Waldron centre could not assess or help and attend to people who say and look acutely unwell. \n\nWill be leaving Deptford Surgery and hoping to join another with hopefully more professional staff.

Unfortunately she saw us minimum 5mins later than scheduled appointment. She examined the finger within 10 sec and prescribed the ointment (everything took her 2 mins). As my other daughter was not well I asked the doctor to check her throat and chest. GP seemed very upset I asked her to do it but started checking my daughters throat. As she did not open it wide enough the gp decided to take the spoon to open it wider. Suddenly she changed her mind and started saying that she shouldn’t be doing it and I should book another appointment. I said that it is impossible to get double appointment and I asked her only to check so it doesn’t take that long. She started complaining that “I will have to treat her if I find something”. This attitude made me worried about NHS doctors who prefer not to find anything in case they need to treat the patient! In the end she did not check my daughters throat because her rude complains upset my daughter and she started crying. When I was leaving the doctor started educating me about 111 nhs service which I told her that works only in theory and patients are told to go to the nearest emergency department. I must admit that every time I see her she is not nice and grumpy. My daughter will not want to see any gp any more after this woman who has no empathy for children so not even mentioning the adults. I get an impression that gps in the practices use the nhs crisis to complain for no reason as their work can not be compared to doctors’ in hospitals and other nhs jobs.

I knew immediately that I’d dislocated my left shoulder. Forty-plus years ago I had a Putti-Platt operation on my right shoulder so I knew what was in front of me. I walked a quarter of a mile home and my wife took me to A&E. This is where my report really begins.  \r\nI was seen by the staff on duty within 5 minutes of registering. I was x-rayed where it was confirmed that part of the socket (glenoid lip) had broken so it wouldn’t be as straight forward as the last time. The shoulder was reset and placed in a sling to maintain stability. I was instructed not to remove the sling until I’d seen the specialist. I was back home after 4 hours of what I can only describe as excellent medical attention.  \r\nDay 2:  \r\nI was contacted by the hospital staff to go in for a CT scan on my shoulder. Being a public holiday I was in and out the hospital within 20 minutes.  \r\nDay 3:  \r\nThis time I was contacted by one of the orthopedic doctors to say that my case merited surgery and that I was to report to the ward in a few days to be prepared for surgery.  \r\nDay 5:  \r\nAll went well and I was admitted into a single room in the ward where I was given all the necessary preparations.  \r\nDay 6:  \r\nFirst thing in the morning I was seen by my surgeon who explained fully what lay ahead especially in comparison to my previous experiences. All other staff explained their role in my operation so the operation went ahead that afternoon.  \r\nI was back in my room a bit later than planned but all had gone well and I had a reasonably good night’s rest.  \r\nDay 7:  \r\nOnce again my surgeon came in and explained in great detail the procedure that had to be done to repair the damage suffered in the fall. All the other staff, Anaesthesia, Physiotherapy etc came in to check me out and I was discharged that afternoon.  \r\nDay 8:  \r\nI am a retired scientist who has always trained and kept fit so all the extra details given were much appreciated.  \r\nAll the staff that I came into contact with during my treatment, from the room cleaning lady right up to the surgeon were a credit to the NHS and Crosshouse Hospital in particular. I just cannot speak highly enough of my overall treatment but thanks to everyone I came in contact with and the ones in the background I never met.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-01-08T21:16:17.8566667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-01-10T10:51:14.49","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Ayrshire & Arran","count":13},{"name":"Scottish Government","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/729252","id":"729252"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/729252/responses","id":"729252"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/729252/healthservices","id":"729252"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/729252/tags","id":"729252"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/a111h_110","id":"A111H_110","score":5},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/a111h_180","id":"A111H_180","score":5},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sa9-community-physio-east","id":"sa9-community-physio-east","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/attention","id":"attention"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ct%20scan","id":"CT scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dislocated","id":"dislocated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/exercise","id":"exercise"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fall","id":"fall"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/operation","id":"operation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/physiotherapy","id":"physiotherapy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/running","id":"running"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/seen%20quickly","id":"seen quickly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/shoulder","id":"shoulder"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20introduction","id":"staff introduction"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/well%20looked%20after","id":"well looked after"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appreciated","id":"appreciated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/explanations","id":"explanations"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/732472","id":"732472"}]},{"id":729861,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Awful waiting times","body":"My grandmother was taken to hospital in an ambulance to Frimley Park hospital... once getting there has not seen a doctor for over 6 hours and still waiting.

I feel so exhausted the next day, had no full night sleep since he was born. Then I decided to attend the sleeping programme. I came to know about this programme at Sure Start as I attend the stay and play class every week. I start coming to this programme with Emma & Cilla running it and I can say this is the best programme I have attended and right decision I have made. I get the chance to speak about all the issues I am going through with my sons sleeping, discuss it with other parents, listen to their opinions and issues and have learned so many new things of what I can do and what could be changed with the sleeping routine and even the daytime routine. I have made these changes to his sleeping routine and I can say now he's asleep by 10:00 pm, latest 10:30 pm every night. Its late but it is good for my family routine as his dad comes home after 9 pm and he wants to see him before he goes to sleep. So, I am more confident emotionally, and mentally.

I rang Gravesend Minor Injury Unit and the lady in a very welcoming tone recommended I go there. On arrival I didn’t have to wait more than 10 minutes and I was examined by a lovely nurse, who took down all my details and recommended an x-ray.  I was then taken through by a very cheerful male nurse, who examined my foot and comforted me that the swelling etc could be an over stretched ligament.  I was sent to be x-ray, within 5 minutes x-ray complete, I returned back to the cubicle and in great detail shown the x-ray be another male nurse.  I’d had other fractures that I hadn’t realised but a ligament had been the problem this time.  We were very impressed by the professional attitude and how informative the staff were, happy to answer any questions and kept me laughing to take my mind off the pain, they both were very cheerful and giving me much welcomed advice on improving my exercise routine to strengthening weights which I hadn’t thought of before at my age (54).  We had a very engaging chat on how I could improve my health and suggestions on exercise and to change my diet, as needing to after the Christmas greediness, as the x-ray showed a possibility of osteoporosis.  So thank you very much.  For A brilliant service, for treating me with much care and respect, very quickly and thoroughly.  And for answering all my questions and giving me great advice.

I also must add it took me to tell the Dr that I was suicidal for them to finally do something. \nFast forward until 2019 I needed higher pain management medication because other options for anything have never been explored. I have now been prescribed morphine, the liquid when needed and the slow release. When I take the morphine (as I'm prescribed to do) and then need to request more, this request has had a 100% decline rate meaning that a medication review is needed. After going to each appointment I am then given the pain relief I need and then have to do the same thing every month. \nI completely understand that the Drs need to ensure that the medication is being taken with care and in the proper way, however I still have to waste everyone's time by taking an appointment away from someone that actually needs and wants the appointment. \nI have now taken to decision to move practices because there is only so much one person can take when it comes to awful non-caring service. \nThe situation I find myself in every month is making my depression so much worse, because not only am I having to worry about not getting what I need to be able to function and work but I then have to take time out of work in which means I do not get paid which then adds stress and anxiety on top of everything else. \nThe fact that this practice has been very happy to simply throw drugs at the problem for 10 years and now because the Govt have said that there is a problem with Drs prescribing too many opiates, I have to jump through hoops to get the medication that allows me to get out of bed in the morning and work full time so I am not relying on other people and benefits. \n\nNot only does this cause stress, anxiety and makes depression worse, this is extremely unhelpful and worrying that this has to happen now when I am in this position due to being misdiagnosed for so long and by having medication given to me left, right and centre.

I woke up in hospital and walked away once I had physical strength again.  \r\nI feel that the crisis team and mental health service in York are in need of change. People are being neglected, ignored, pushed away and given labels that don't belong to them.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-01-08T20:29:04.5766667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-01-10T15:24:28.57","readBy":[{"name":"Tees, Esk and Wear Valleys NHS Foundation Trust","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/729240","id":"729240"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/729240/responses","id":"729240"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/729240/healthservices","id":"729240"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/729240/tags","id":"729240"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rx3-york-access-crisis","id":"rx3-york-access-crisis","score":1},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rx3-york-homebt","id":"rx3-york-homebt","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/crisis","id":"crisis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ignored","id":"ignored"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/neglected","id":"neglected"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bpd","id":"BPD"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/empathy","id":"empathy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/non%20judgemental","id":"non judgemental"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/suicidal","id":"suicidal"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/732704","id":"732704"}]}]
