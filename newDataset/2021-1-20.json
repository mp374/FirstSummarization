Then something changed just before covid hit town. The groups changed I felt judged and unsupported it became a free for all and our family was no longer there as people stopped coming to the groups. Then came covid. And all of a sudden staff got switched and changed which was hard for me to take as my amazing worker had been with me for years and I needed their support but they were moved. I hate change especially when it's something so important then I started getting phone calls from someone else who I feel is not qualified. Yes they have been through the process but in honesty I think I'm longer sober than they are. I feel like AA is being rammed down my throat every chance they get. I was previously going to AA meetings and this staff member was also. I just think its a conflict of interest and also because it works for one person doesn't mean it works for us all, if I wanted to go to AA I would. I no longer feel supported I feel like I've been put with someone who doesn't have a clue about my situation, doesn't understand and thinks they are doing better than me. I don't know what's going on but I do know it seems that lots of good people have been lost. Having someone who has been through what you have is great but I feel talked down to.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-01-16T00:33:42.79","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-01-20T09:02:46.517","readBy":[{"name":"Change Grow Live","count":7}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/816908","id":"816908"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/816908/responses","id":"816908"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/816908/healthservices","id":"816908"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/816908/tags","id":"816908"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/nms-cambridgeshire-wisbech","id":"nms-cambridgeshire-wisbech","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/alcohol","id":"alcohol"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/awesome","id":"awesome"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/changes","id":"Changes"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good","id":"good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/groups","id":"groups"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helpful","id":"helpful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/important","id":"important"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/judged","id":"judged"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/the%20change","id":"the change"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/throat","id":"throat"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing","id":"amazing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported","id":"supported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/like%20family","id":"like family"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/previous%20keyworker","id":"previous keyworker"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/judgement","id":"judgement"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20changes","id":"staff changes"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/initial%20support","id":"initial support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%20restrictions","id":"covid restrictions"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/818054","id":"818054"}]},{"id":817325,"author":"novemberdw96","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Poor communication Nottinghamshire mental health services","body":"In November 2019 I had a counselling session with an organisation called trent pts.

However, I really feel we all have a responsibility to identify areas for improvement and areas where risk is not managed. I am really disappointed that I cannot in good faith recommend Adult Mental Health Services. I do not feel it is patient centered or safe.  \r\nI have accessed different resources within Mental Health and the 3rd Sector in attempts to manage my anxiety and depression, desperately trying to keep myself safe and well. My GP has always been a fantastic support and I do feel certain individuals on my journey have understood me, to an extent, and supported me to explore SOME aspects of my mental health and management strategies. Some of the professionals I have encountered very much appeared to have a one size fits all approach and I really struggled with that. Some professionals made careless throwaway comments which were very damaging. Unfortunately, I do not have the recall of all the names involved in my care but I do prefer to address the service as a whole.  \r\nMy mind does not work in the same way as most. I struggle to visualise concepts, engage in mindfulness or use ‘grounding’ as so many other factors come into play. In honesty I feel I may present with an Autism Spectrum Disorder also and I am curious as to the different strategies that would be suggested for individuals who have difficulty with imagination, communication, sensory behaviours and rigid thinking alongside their mental health. It becomes nearly impossible to do some of the work suggested and fuels that feeling of ‘failure’ and self-loathing. I feel that some professionals did listen to some of my needs and tried to adapt ideas. However, I honestly feel that this took longer in terms of a therapy process. I feel there are ideas I want to consider but there was no time. But what if considering these with support is what I need?  \r\nTime. That became the issue. I had exceeded the agreed amount of sessions. Not agreed by me, that was never mentioned until near the end of my sessions, but agreed by the service somewhere I presume. This is abhorrent to me. Why was I not involved in decision making initially? Why am I still not? I felt like I was told this is what is happening. How can sessions end when I don’t feel equipt to safely manage my own risk? I have taken a nose dive into hell over the Christmas period and on my last session was lying in darkness, breaking my heart in fear of what I might do to myself. In fear of not being aware of who to get help from. I was told to call the Samaritans? I’m trying to manage a risk with the professional support that has been given to me and I felt worthless. How on earth am I meant to contact a complete stranger? Someone who does not know or understand me? It took huge amounts of energy and trust to access all that I have accessed. The thought of engaging with a stranger about anything terrifies me but to call a stranger and bare my soul. I don’t want to firefight. I want to develop a better understanding of myself and be able to manage my risk and the impact of this horror with increasing independence. Not just be left to deal with it because I’ve exceeded the number of sessions decided by the service. I cannot see how this is patient centred or safe. Where is my wellbeing in all of this? What if I did damage that I can’t take back? What if this now makes me lose faith in all the work that has been done or opt out in the future?  \r\nI also want to comment on failure to attend. I have always had feedback that I am an individual who engages well and wants to make changes. I think it’s exceptionally important to be patient centred and consider the impact of these difficulties on my ability to always attend a session. Sometimes I literally couldn’t move myself from my bed to the bathroom; yet I am “not engaging” if I missed a session on those days. Language like that again actually made my mental health deteriorate. I’m trying desperately but it’s still not good enough. I know that in my own service we consider each circumstance individually and look at that holistically. I feel so disappointed to have not had the same care, especially in a service where fragility, safety and mental health are at the core.  \r\nThe services I have accessed are CPN (excellent professional), Psychiatry (difficult professional), Crisis support from various CPNs (very mixed experience) and psychology (nice professional but hugely concerned at the way the service works as described).","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-01-15T15:17:19.85","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-01-20T09:36:37.193","readBy":[{"name":"NHS

service user","title":"Miscarriage and pregnancy","body":"During 2018 and late 2019 I suffered 4 miscarriages in very close succession. This was an extremely traumatic and worrying time for both myself and my husband. However, the care of the medical staff at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary made the experience a lot easier. I was amazed at the empathy of all the staff within the Rubislaw ward. The care and attention i received within this ward on all occasions was always of the highest standard.  \r\nSimilarly, with the services I received within the miscarriage clinic, run initially by Professor Cummings and then Dr. Shetty. Their expertise in this area was second to none and their ability to reassure and comfort really did make a huge difference.  \r\nIn January 2020 I found out I was pregnant again. Dr Shetty was available at all times to answer my questions and attended my first scan at 7 weeks where, for the first time, I had a healthy heartbeat. Dr Shetty seem to understand the anxiety this could cause after so many miscarriages and it was a huge comfort to have in the room.  \r\nMy care throughout my pregnancy really was fantastic. Even with the Covid pandemic I felt I was treated as a priority. My anxiety after so many miscarriages was high but the team allowed several reassurance scans. This made a huge difference to my pregnancy and really helped me through. The ultrasound team never once made me feel like a burden. Similarly the midwifery team at Inverurie were fantastic and never questioned my numerous concerns about reduced movement, which I believe were driven by anxiety more than anything else.  \r\nIn addition, I had access to Shona who really helped on the mental health side. I can honestly say Shona helped me turn a corner with my anxiety throughout my pregnancy. I was extremely anxious and negative at the start, even having to be signed off from work. Shona worked with me on a regular basis and really helped me feel more positive and even excited - something that is hard to feel after so many losses. She helped with everything from dealing with the huge sense of loss from the pregnancies that ended all the way through to helping me deal with anxieties around giving birth and beyond. I didn’t realise there was such a service but her support was invaluable and I know I would have really struggled without her.  \r\nAs I’d had a section with my previous daughter I opted for one again. I could not believe how ‘slick’ the process was. From the meeting and guidance with my consultant through to the set up on the day, I was amazed by how efficient everything was. My daughter was born on the morning of the 2nd October 2020 and although I can’t remember the names of the surgeons, midwife and anaesthetists i will always remember their huge level of skill and professionalism. They were all truly fantastic at what they did.  \r\nI opted for one night in hospital which was due to feeling ok to go home. Whilst in hospital all staff were very attentive and dealt with my every need....even cups of tea in the middle of the night.  \r\nAs with all my daughters the Inverurie based community midwives were fantastic and even with Covid managed to visit me on a regular basis. My care has now transferred to Gail, health visitor who i already know and find her to be beyond helpful, attentive as well as extremely personable.  \r\nI really do want to take this opportunity to thank everyone involved with both the miscarriages and the pregnancy. I was shocked by how affected I was with the miscarriages and how this affected my mental health. However, having the fantastic support do the NHS really helped me get through an extremely difficult time. I have so much to say thank you for and I really do hope that everyone within the Rubislaw ward, miscarriage clinic, wider maternity unit, Shona, the Inverurie midwifery team, the ARI scanning department and the health visitors really know the value that they add and how appreciated I am of the services they deliver. Thank you.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-01-18T23:33:47.0933333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-01-20T10:15:38.727","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Grampian","count":11},{"name":"NHS Education for Scotland","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/817526","id":"817526"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/817526/responses","id":"817526"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/817526/healthservices","id":"817526"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/817526/tags","id":"817526"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/n161h","id":"N161H","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/n198h-general-wards","id":"N198H-general-wards","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/n331h-midwifery","id":"N331H-midwifery","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxious","id":"anxious"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/above%20and%20beyond","id":"above and beyond"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazed","id":"amazed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/birth","id":"birth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/giving%20birth","id":"giving birth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helped","id":"helped"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/invaluable","id":"invaluable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/maternity","id":"maternity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/midwives","id":"midwives"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/miscarriage","id":"miscarriage"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurse","id":"nurse"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/positive","id":"positive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pregnancy","id":"pregnancy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pregnant","id":"pregnant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/run","id":"run"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scan","id":"scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/section","id":"section"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ultrasound","id":"ultrasound"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appreciated","id":"appreciated"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/818501","id":"818501"}]},{"id":817516,"author":"Pablo55","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"I would gladly put myself in their care again.","body":"I recently attended Monklands Hospital Dermatology department.

I was extremely nervous having never needed this type of hospital treatment before. I needn't have worried as despite the appointment for a colposcopy being during the covid-19 pandemic I was seen extremely quickly and all of the staff I saw on the day were professional, warm and friendly, putting me at ease.  \r\nI received my results from this quickly and was told I had to go for another treatment. I was far more worried about the loop treatment, it seemed more serious after I'd stupidly read information online (always a bad idea!). I yet again was seen quickly (mid pandemic). Dr Dunmore could not have been more friendly and reassuring which is exactly what I needed to be put at ease. The procedure wasn't bad at all, partly because the nurse (sorry I don't know her name) kept me chatting and was also very warm while Dr Dunmore was extremely professional and therefore knew what to expect in advance. I felt listened to, I didn't want to know what was happening as it was happening and was glad that wasn't a problem.  \r\nI'm hoping I don't need to go back but if I did I'd feel extremely confident that I was in the best possible hands.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-01-19T15:34:52.0466667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-01-20T10:26:47.243","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":8},{"name":"Ulster University, MBBS (Medicine) 2021","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/817814","id":"817814"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/817814/responses","id":"817814"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/817814/healthservices","id":"817814"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/817814/tags","id":"817814"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/g207h_502","id":"G207H_502","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nervous","id":"nervous"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/colposcopy","id":"colposcopy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gynaecology","id":"gynaecology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professional","id":"professional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tests","id":"tests"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/warm","id":"warm"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fantastic","id":"fantastic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassuring","id":"reassuring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/relieved","id":"relieved"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20ease","id":"at ease"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/loop%20excision","id":"loop excision"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/818048","id":"818048"}]},{"id":815584,"author":"Rainbow123","authorRoleId":3,"authorRole":"a parent/guardian","title":"Autism Diagnosis","body":"My 6 Year old daughter is on the waiting list for a diagnosis for Autism with a PDA profile. We know this is likely to be the main diagnosis due to imput from the school, the educational psychologist and the paediatrician, although there may also be other issues as well. All three have recognised that she is in crisis, frequently telling me she wants to die and doesn't want to exist, she scratches and hits herself. Her GP, the paediatrician and Enable have all put through requests to Camhs for her case to be escalated, I think the educational psychologist has as well. Her GP called them directly to advise she was in crisis and the response she received which she relayed to me was that her and hundreds of others. I understand that there is a long waiting list and that we are on it. I understand that there are hundreds of children who need help. A 6 year old should not be talking about wanting to kill her self!!!  \r\nWithout a diagnosis she cannot get the specialised help she clearly needs, she can't get the specialised medication she may need, the school can't get the funding to get the additional personnel support that they need, they have identified that she needs 2 on one support, she has reduced hours and all the sensory equipment they can get their hands on but despite being in P2 there are kids in nursery who recognise more letters and numbers than she can.  \r\nShe needs help, we need help and despite all of these agencies trying to arrange and provide that we can't get any further because Camhs will not engage when asked to participate in multi agency meetings to support my child.  \r\nThe reason we need a dual pathway assessment is due to her having multiple personas that she inhabits to enable her to find a way to deal with her anxiety, however some of these personas do not get on with her as herself and so they hurt her, and tell her to do things, and exclude her from games. I have had to console a sobbing child who came through from her bedroom with a red face, telling me her imaginary friend slapped her and told her she wasn't allowed to play in her own room. She has been in terror in a shopping centre because she became a little boy whose mum had died and she didn't recognise me as her mum and ran away from me. If this was in the street she could have run in to the road and got knocked over as she has no road sense at the best of times.  \r\nUltimately I feel let down that we are stuck where we are. Everyone we can get help from is providing all they can but we are basically all waiting on Camhs now.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-01-11T14:00:19.6666667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-01-20T10:30:28.32","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Fife","count":16},{"name":"Fife Health & Social Care Partnership","count":2},{"name":"Scottish Government","count":1},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/815584","id":"815584"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/815584/responses","id":"815584"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/815584/healthservices","id":"815584"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/815584/tags","id":"815584"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/fifehscp-gps","id":"fifehscp-gps","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sf9-child-comm-services","id":"sf9-child-comm-services","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/crisis","id":"crisis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/autism","id":"autism"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/camhs","id":"camhs"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diagnosis","id":"diagnosis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/die","id":"die"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/engagement","id":"engagement"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/face","id":"face"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/referral%20time","id":"referral time"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/run","id":"run"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/completely%20disgusted%20and%20let%20down","id":"completely disgusted and let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/818137","id":"818137"}]},{"id":817713,"author":"boxwood73","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Covid vaccination","body":"I visited Meadowgreen health centre on Jan 9th at Jordanthorpe Sheffield 8  \r\nJust to let you know the organisation was excellent, all staff worked extremely hard.  \r\nThe visit only took 35 minutes and I was most impressed.

The assessment was very thorough and I found Alison to be a skilled practitioner, adept at listening and capturing the nuanced information necessary to make an accurate diagnosis. I found Alison to be very personable and easy to talk to. The subsequent report that Alison produced was very accurate and the whole experience has allowed me to understand myself better and to better cope with my condition moving forward.  \r\nAside from the inevitable pressures on the service and resultant delays caused by our current times, I couldn't have asked for a better experience. Harnessing the video conferencing technology to be able to continue to deliver this essential service was a great idea and in general the VC was very reliable. We did encounter the occasional minor technical gremlin but having used many VC services in my working life, this tends to come with the territory!  \r\nHaving tried to obtain this type of assistance before moving to Scotland, I have to say the service here is much better than in England.

Next day I went up there to see my mum and to tell her what happened one staff member started to be verbally abusive towards me and also refused to leave the bed and give any privacy. I asked them several times to leave but they refused and started shouting, became abusive, called me names and called for security. I felt that this was totally unnecessary and I was prepared to stand my ground. My poor ill mum asked them to leave her alone with her son but to no avail, the junior doctor was also rude and the same nurse who refused to leave the bottom of the bed made hurtful comments even though I believe they were aware I had depression and anxiety.
