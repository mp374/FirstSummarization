Another gp phone call antibiotics over the phone. Again it's reoccured, I'm reluctant to ring as it's near impossible to see a gp. Always a phone call. My problem is debilitating and painful yet I'm now reluctant to phone my gp. Service was excellent but since covid I feel I don't have  gp support just a phone call each time. I'm so  grateful to our gps and NHS, but I don't feel supported right now. This problem has put my life on hold. I feel I should be able to make a appointment on what I feel is a emergency but my gp doesn't. I'm a low gp user apart from this problem I hate going to a doctor, but when I need to see one. It's a phone call.

Perhaps to reduce patients coming in?\n\nYou can only book an appointment on the day, and to make matters worse. You have to call up at either 9am or 2 pm, and the likelihood is that they will be booked up. I have no idea why I can not book an appointment in the future. Why do you only offer on the day appointments? Makes no sense. Appointments are intended for future visits.\n\nAlso, I really am unhappy about the intrusive question from the receptionist. They are not doctors which means they do not hold patient-doctor confidentially.\n\nAnd this is not mentioning the lack of mental health services. One male GP was empathetic but had nothing to offer. This left me going to the hospital. I am sure the whole point of a GP surgery is to reduce the number of patients requiring hospital visitation.

Why waste my time with that if they care so little about their patients.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-09-04T11:51:21","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-09-05T11:37:37","readBy":[{"name":"Barnet, Enfield and Haringey Mental Health NHS Trust x","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/784545","id":"784545"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/784545/responses","id":"784545"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/784545/healthservices","id":"784545"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/784545/tags","id":"784545"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rrpj3","id":"RRPJ3","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/785598","id":"785598"}]},{"id":784548,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Best practice!","body":"I have been with Church Street Practice since we moved to the area.

With better parking.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-09-04T12:36:59","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-09-05T12:13:33","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/784567","id":"784567"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/784567/responses","id":"784567"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/784567/healthservices","id":"784567"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/784567/tags","id":"784567"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l83100","id":"L83100","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/day%20surgery","id":"day surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/parking","id":"parking"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/785558","id":"785558"}]},{"id":784566,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Thank you for good care for my aunt","body":"Over the past few weeks the care my sick great aunt received has been very good. thank you to the doctors who handled the process well. the doctor was prompt in providing the death certificate and also was kind enough to send a condolence card. this small gesture was much appreciated. thank you","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-09-04T14:04:23","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-09-05T12:15:46","readBy":[{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2020)","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/784566","id":"784566"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/784566/responses","id":"784566"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/784566/healthservices","id":"784566"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/784566/tags","id":"784566"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/c86625","id":"C86625","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/death","id":"death"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good","id":"good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appreciated","id":"appreciated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/816963","id":"816963"}]},{"id":784563,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Blood testing service phone line","body":"52 people in queue waited for 1 hour and 20 minutes for the phone to be answered.

I also spoke to the anthesitist and surgeon, so I could discuss my conerns surrounding the surgery.\n\nThe nurses continued to keep me informed, even letting me know where my son was on the surgery list. Thankfully he was first up and we were walked into the theatre. The surgical team attempted to insert a cannula, which wouldn't go in. Instead of persisting (which has happened previously at a different hospital), the staff did not hesitate to change tac and go to plan b. I was very grateful for this, as my son remained calm.\n\nI was notified as soon as the surgery had finished and again walked down by a nurse to see my son. \n\nI was given a debrief by the recovery unit and I also received a debrief later on by the surgeon.\n\nOn leaving, my son was delighted to receive a jigsaw.\n\nUpon reflection, my son had a calm, pain free operation and we were both treated wonderfully by the staff. It was an anxious time, as a mother, but by the staff keeping me continually informed throughout our visit, it really helped me cope with the whole experience.\n\nI can honestly say that this has been the best hospital experience I have ever had and this hospital should be a model for all others.

Feeling unwell during the summer last year I visited their walk in practice, for the first time on Thursday evening, 8th August 2019. The receptionists were lovely, one taking my initial call before I left home, the other giving me directions and advice on where I could park my car.  I completed the necessary forms and didn't have to wait long, before being seen by a GP, who was wonderful. He listened patiently, asked pertinent questions, had a gentle manner, was sympathetic, kind and caring. The second time I visited the surgery was on Sunday morning, 5th July 2020. The receptionist came to the door and explained the process to follow, because of Covid 19. She was patient, kind, told me to ring the surgery, photograph my infection, send it through to an e-mail address she would text to my phone and wait for a call. The nurse rang within a short period of time and was absolutely wonderful. She sympathised, asked pertinent questions, was caring, kind and again thorough during the telephone consultation. Unfortunately it was 3rd time 'unlucky on 4th September 2020.' I had suffered an insect bite, possibly one from a spider last weekend and it had continued to get worse during the week. My Mum is a nurse in Belfast and I sent her a picture and said how I was feeling. Not one to allow us to ever have a day off work and only go to the GP if necessary she told me to go and see about it asap. I had also gone to a pharmacy the previous evening, showed my bite and he said it may be infected and should visit my GP. (also patient and kind). Tonight when I contacted the surgery about 6.15pm, the receptionist was lovely. I gave her details over the phone and she said a nurse would phone and ended the call saying to take care. The nurse rang after 7pm and the lack of 'bedside manner' is putting it mildly. The tone of her voice implied she would tell me my symptoms, rather than listening and accepting, me explaining to her what my actual symptoms were. Her response was she wouldn't normally give an antibiotic (I hadn't asked for antibiotics) and as a minimum she expected bites to be monitored for a week. As I received the bite possibly last Sunday, exception 24 hours it would be a week and there hadn't been any improvement. I explained my symptoms again and she said they were normal for insect bites. As I am prone to being bitten and having had reactions to bites throughout my life, I would recognise the difference on what is normal and what is an infection. At no time did she request a photograph which may have been pertinent to a thorough diagnosis. Whilst I respect and admire all of our NHS workers, during this difficult time, its disappointing to receive such a service, when kindness can effect positive change during this pandemic. This nurse needs to reflect if she was the patient and had this treatment.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-09-04T22:39:59","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-09-05T13:37:38","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/784618","id":"784618"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/784618/responses","id":"784618"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/784618/healthservices","id":"784618"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/784618/tags","id":"784618"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/y02769","id":"Y02769","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/antibiotics","id":"antibiotics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diagnosis","id":"diagnosis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/infected","id":"infected"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/infection","id":"infection"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/normal","id":"normal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pharmacy","id":"Pharmacy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/positive","id":"positive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wonderful","id":"wonderful"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/790904","id":"790904"}]},{"id":784617,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Rude Reception Manager","body":"I called On a Friday afternoon because I was extremely worried about some results I had received wanting to speak to a Doctor and was told I would Have to wait til Monday and that the doctors were not available to help me when I perused this I was told it was too late.

Out of desperation I phoned 111, 30 minutes later I was phoned by my GP who sorted my prescription and was great. To be told I could not speak to a GP for three days and then to phone 111 and hear from a GP in 30 minutes is very frustrating.

The receptionists were as always helpful and accompanying and I was able to have a telephone consultation with my GP the same day. In the current climate I find this amazing and an incredible commitment to the patient.\nMy GP arranged an appointment for me as the issue could not be examined in a telephone call and he was so understanding, kind and supportive. He offered me time and reassurance whilst including me in the decision making around my care. Instead of being given a holding response or told to come back in six months I was given full support and a plan was implemented to address the concerns I had discussed with him.\nI think the measure of an exceptional practitioner is one who, whilst having the clinical knowledge and expertise, administers is in a humanistic, attentive, calm and empathic manner. My GP has these attributes and I came away feeling like I had received exceptional and bespoke care and support.\nThroughout COVID the staff at Mansfield Medical Centre haven't faltered in continuing to deliver the same high quality services that we patients have come to appreciate and enjoy. \nI take my hat off to them and thank my lucky stars I have such a fabulous practice!
