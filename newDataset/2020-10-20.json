My baby was so well cared for, as was I. The staff, both midwives and MSWs, were understanding, supportive, professional, caring and quite frankly, utterly amazing. Not only did they provide exceptional care for my baby - conducting 4 hourly observations, assessing him daily, undertaking numerous tests to ensure he was making good progress and giving him any medical interventions that he needed, they also provided incredible support for me.  \r\nDue to giving birth in the pandemic, restrictions meant that my partner was only able to visit me for three hours a day (for which, I am so grateful). However, I never felt alone or unsupported. I was incredibly emotional at times - a combination of tiredness, feeling overwhelmed as a new mum and the shock of having a baby four weeks earlier than I expected! However, the incredible staff were so understanding and supportive and anything I asked for, was provided - usually I didn’t even need to ask! Considering I was on a hospital ward, I felt quite at home. The staff were so friendly and knew what was happening with my baby and me which shows what professionals they are and how extensive the handovers were - at no point did I not feel confident in their care.  \r\nNot only did the midwives and MSWs provide excellent medical care for our baby and emotional support for me, they were so approachable and knowledgeable, I would often ask for advice on things such as feeding, sleeping and general new mum worries which were always answered patiently and extensively and made me feel much more confident in my abilities as a new parent.  \r\nAnother fantastic part of Wheal Fortune is The Nest. The infant feeding team were absolutely incredible. I received such brilliant support from them and for my entire stay the team spent numerous hours with me to help me with breastfeeding, something I was so keen to do but found I struggled with. On my discharge from hospital, they set me up with a plan to help me continue at home and in my first days at home, even telephoned me to check in and see how I was and how breastfeeding was going, going above and beyond what was expected from us.  \r\nThe other staff in Treliske were also fantastic and I was visited by the midwives, obstetricians and anesthetists that had been with me on my delivery to see how I was following the birth. I had no expectations of this happening and it was such an appreciated gesture.  \r\nThe catering staff were also fantastic, they took such great care of me and were friendly and kind - often checking that I was adequately fed and watered and even knew how I took my tea! Again, the cleaners were friendly and would always have a quick chat and ask how I was each morning - again something I never expected but so appreciated.  \r\nBeing admitted to transitional care following the birth of our baby was not something I expected to happen and as a new parent, very daunting and overwhelming. However, every single person that I came into contact with on Wheal Fortune was professional, caring, knowledgeable and friendly. I am so, so grateful to all of the midwives and MSWs for proving such exceptional care to me and my baby and for being such a strong, emotional support for me at a time when I was at my most vulnerable. I cannot thank them enough and will be forever grateful to them for getting our little man fit and healthy and ready to come home with us.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-10-17T15:14:08.54","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-10-20T09:58:07.617","readBy":[{"name":"Royal Cornwall Hospitals NHS Trust","count":11}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/796166","id":"796166"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/796166/responses","id":"796166"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/796166/healthservices","id":"796166"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/796166/tags","id":"796166"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/ref12_501","id":"REF12_501","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/above%20and%20beyond","id":"above and beyond"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/approachable","id":"approachable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/birth","id":"birth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breastfeeding%20support","id":"Breastfeeding Support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20about","id":"Cared about"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/caring","id":"caring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/catering","id":"catering"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/knowledgeable","id":"knowledgeable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/midwives","id":"midwives"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/overwhelmed","id":"overwhelmed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professional","id":"professional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supportive","id":"supportive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tiredness","id":"tiredness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/understanding","id":"understanding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vulnerable","id":"vulnerable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/well%20baby","id":"well baby"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20for","id":"cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pandemic","id":"pandemic"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/796800","id":"796800"}]},{"id":796363,"author":"TM68","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Breathingspace.scot","body":"I have used the Breathingspace.scot Webchat a few times recently.  \r\nThe opportunity to chat anonymously via a chat function is great as I would never contemplate making contact by telephone.  \r\nThe advisors I have spoken to have been wonderful; very patient and empathetic. I've felt listened to and supported.  \r\nHowever, there are a few issues that massively impact on my emotional state when I need support.  \r\nI realise that Webchat is a pilot project but it is almost impossible to speak with an advisor. Usually the chat button is not there which means you can't connect. As I said previously, I feel that speaking to someone by phone is not helpful for me when I feel that I need support.  \r\nOn more than a few occasions, the button has told me I am first in the queue. I have waited for 5-10 minutes on occasion only for a message saying nobody is available to chat.  \r\nOne thing I find incredibly difficult to answer is when an advisor opens the conversation by saying \"what can I do for you today?\", or \"how are you today?\" I find these very difficult to answer. I don't know what the best way to open a conversation is, but I have disconnected a couple of times after being incapable of replying.  \r\nFinally, recently there have been episodes when the conversation freezes and I have to close down the app to fix it. Usually, the conversation reappears but twice I have lost the conversation. I use a Samsung S20 which runs well so I do wonder if it is a glitch in the app.  \r\nOverall, when I can connect, I can't fault the support given on Breathingspace.scot. I just feel that the availability via Webchat can cause more emotional problems.","criticality":"minimally critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-10-18T11:53:45.4533333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-10-20T10:15:16.203","readBy":[{"name":"NHS 24","count":27},{"name":"NHS Education for Scotland","count":1},{"name":"Scottish Recovery Network","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/796363","id":"796363"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/796363/responses","id":"796363"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/796363/healthservices","id":"796363"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/796363/tags","id":"796363"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/nhs24-breathingspace","id":"NHS24-breathingspace","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/patient","id":"patient"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/service%20availability","id":"service availability"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/empathetic","id":"empathetic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported","id":"supported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/web%20chat","id":"web chat"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/glitches","id":"glitches"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/796946","id":"796946"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/802004","id":"802004"}]},{"id":796167,"author":"Lenagrant","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"The shortcomings of Mental Health Services","body":"First of all I have a complaint on the shortcomings of Mental Health Services.

The relationship with the OAS service never really got off the ground and I felt I was not being listened to. For example, I mentioned I had been physically assaulted by a man, a very large man, who pushed me at a party because I spurned his advances. Contact of course in Mental Health is frugal and limited and I was granted only an annual visit. The following year I told of a very serious sexual assault on me and the reply was just that they were sorry to hear this. End.

Although I didn't know it at the time, and fought against staff and the system, I was experiencing a manic episode. I arrived at the Hospital under the supervision of Police Scotland in handcuffs.  \r\nDr Shankar immediately recognised the symptoms, I was initially held for a weekend which quickly extended to a month. It took me days to realise that this was for my own good. NHS nursing staff and Consultants provided me with world class care and looking back I can say in absolute confidence that I owe them my life.  \r\nThe stay in the MHU (Mental Health Unit) was life-changing. Staff were friendly and welcoming. I spent time on Wards 1 and 3. I'm grateful to Nurses Fiona and Mark, and Student Alex (who was brilliant) on Ward 1. On ward 3 the list only grows, Dr Ayeer seemed to understand me better than any other Consultant at that point. Ward 3 Nurses are too many to count. A few assistants and students stand out. Nurses Noé, Lucinda and Iona—my thanks. Every member of staff deserves mention here.

of interest and poor communication","body":"I heard good things about this surgery from local moms when I moved into the area so I registered my family despite the long waiting list. After registering I was told to make appointment for each family members (each of us on different days as that is what's available) but the receptionist failed to notice my son's DOB. I arrived with my son on the day of his appointment to then be told by the nurse that child under 2yo do not need initial assessment. It was such an inconvenience as I've had to skip my son's nap to make the appointment on time when this could have been avoided had the receptionist paid attention.\n\nA few months ago I made a phone appointment with a GP for my son.There was no allocated time given, I missed the phone call and was left with a voice message from the GP to return her call. However I was not instructed with which number to call back on. Naturally I called back the number from the voice message. I was spoken to in a rude tone and told to call the surgery and not the GP's direct line as if I should know this. It doesn't help after that the surgery line was continuously unavailable. It is hard enough to get an appointment in the first place and such poor connection is frustrating. When I eventually able to speak to the GP, the consultation was rushed and she told me that she didn't have the time to let me read through a letter by a private consultant my son had seen while we were abroad on holiday. Instead was told to email the letter to the surgery, not directly to her, so the surgery can redirect it to a centralized system. Had she cared to know the content of the letter, she could have prescribed the medication suggested by the consultant which is available in pharmacy and could have offered relief to my son whilst we wait to hear further from NHS. \n\nToday I was greeted rudely from a middle aged man who had a go at me for pressing the buzzer too many times. When I tried to speak, I wasn't given a chance to explain myself and was accused of not reading the sign on the door. I was then dismissed like a small child and asked who am I there to see. I apologised and explain myself to the nurse who saw me: Parts of the buzzer was broken and I wasn't sure which button to press and if it was working so have accidentally buzzed too many times. I suggested to the nurse for the sign on the door to be clearer by explaining that although the buzzer looks broken it is working and to inform which specific button to press ie the white one? the two small round bits exposed in the broken section? Maybe put a sign or sticker? Or better change to a new buzzer. I really didn't appreciate being spoken to in such manner. One can express one's frustrations or make a point in a polite and kind manner. Please be mindful on how you speak to a person. You never know what the person is going through. He or she may be going through a hard time and such negativity has a ripple effect that doesn't serve anyone.  \nI've yet to have positive experience.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-10-19T19:54:29","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-10-20T12:25:57","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/796883","id":"796883"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/796883/responses","id":"796883"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/796883/healthservices","id":"796883"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/796883/tags","id":"796883"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/e83638","id":"E83638","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frustrating","id":"frustrating"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/inconvenience","id":"inconvenience"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20cared%20for","id":"not cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/broken","id":"broken"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20about","id":"Cared about"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dismissed","id":"dismissed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good","id":"good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pharmacy","id":"Pharmacy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/positive","id":"positive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/rushed","id":"rushed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20for","id":"cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/797940","id":"797940"}]},{"id":796882,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Flu jab leaflet ","body":"I was given a leaflet about appointments at the surgery in these difficult times.
