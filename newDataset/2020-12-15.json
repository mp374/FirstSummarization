I feel that his treatment has been nothing short of disgusting.  \r\nHe has 3 shattered limbs which were operated on with little or NO follow up resulting in other injuries and more surgery to come. As a result of his accident he has a diagnosis of complex PTSD, this was made worse by his treatment while in hospital. I have witnessed some awful, callous treatment by front line staff. Staff should all be trauma informed but NONE that I encountered seemed to care at all.  \r\nAfter 2 years of my brother desperately trying to get medical staff to listen to him he received X-rays and a scan where it was discovered he still has broken bones and the steel rods and screws had all moved causing pain and injuries to his other leg. As his sister it makes me so angry to witness how hard he tries and how he has been treated by the NHS. He‚Äôs received an apology by letter for some of his treatment, but this is not enough.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-12-12T10:50:57.9333333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-12-15T10:18:04.097","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lothian","count":11},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2021)","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/810188","id":"810188"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/810188/responses","id":"810188"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/810188/healthservices","id":"810188"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/810188/tags","id":"810188"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/s314h_110","id":"S314H_110","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/s314h_180","id":"S314H_180","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/s314h-xrays-scans","id":"S314H-xrays-scans","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/angry","id":"angry"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disgusted","id":"disgusted"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/should%20listen","id":"Should listen"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/broken","id":"broken"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/broken%20bones","id":"broken bones"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diagnosis","id":"diagnosis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/follow%20up","id":"follow up"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/leg","id":"leg"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ptsd","id":"ptsd"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scan","id":"scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/screws","id":"screws"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20training","id":"staff training"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/x-rays","id":"x-rays"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/trauma%20informed%20care","id":"trauma informed care"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/810848","id":"810848"}]},{"id":810784,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Impossible to contact","body":"It is impossible to contact them.

Consequently, I was finding eating, swallowing & speaking more and more difficult. My G. P. conducted a telephone consultation about 1 hour later, and agreed that a face to face consultation was appropriate/necessary. Following a detailed discussion/examination and two telephone calls to on-call doctors at Ninewells, it was agreed that I should attend Ninewells, Oral and Maxillofacial Department for further investigations.  \r\nI travelled straight to Ninewells, and, that afternoon, went through thorough investigations, which concluded that I had two areas of infection linked to a dental abcess. I was admitted to Ward 7 that afternoon for I. V. pain relief & antibiotics pending possible surgery. As it transpired, the I. V. drugs worked overnight and surgery was not required. I then moved to Ward 23B the next morning for continued I. V. antibiotics, before being discharged on the day after. I am now awaiting the tooth being removed by my local Dentist.  \r\nThe thoroughness and close attention from my G. P. (Dr Strachan), all staff in Oral and Maxillofacial, the nurses in Wards 7 & 23B, and the on duty Doctors and Consultants, was exemplary.

She has bipolar disorder but was mentally ok at the start. As her carer, I can spot the early signs of mania and I warned the head nurse that I noticed she was changing mood and should be given her usual antipsychotic medication. Each day thereafter she was progressively a bit worse, and my mum was getting stressed from the C-diff infection, and as she has got good insight she told me she needed to see a Psychiatrist.. which was true.Every day thereafter, I asked nurses at the nursing station about the Psychiatrist and they said they would get one.On about day 4 from onset of bipolar symptoms, I asked a nurse to tell me what dose of medication was being dispensed. and the computer records showed the antipsychotic had been stopped completely...I could not believe it.Whenever I visited the nursing station to voice concerns about my mum, they would ignore me as if I was invisible unless I interrupted whatever they were doing. The junior doctor who was dealing with the physical diagnosis of ulcerative colitis seemed appalled at my mum's mental deterioration. An extremely good doctor and when I mentioned that mum was not swallowing the antibiotics, made sure the nurses watched my mum swallow the antibiotics. Finally I said to the nurse, where is the Psychiatrist? How many Psychiatrists are there? They said they didn't know. Soon after a CPN arrived and they said a Psychiatrist is available only on a particular (e.g. Tuesday) day of the week. In one week., my mum had gone from mentally sane to regressed to a baby. She was in the bed, naked from waist down, open door so any passing visitor could have seen her. Water was out of reach.When I arrived, she was extremely thirsty. She was so regressed she couldn't even hold the beaker to drink. The next day she was 50% better mentally because a Psychiatrist had visited her overnight. Luckily my mum responds very quickly to her antipsychotic medication and she soon recovered and did not need to be admitted to the Mental Health Unit nearby.Some of the nursing staff were good, but clearly not everyone. The junior doctor was particularly good.  \r\n","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-12-13T21:14:33.74","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2020-12-15T12:09:08.853","readBy":[],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/810400","id":"810400"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/810400/responses","id":"810400"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/810400/healthservices","id":"810400"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/810400/tags","id":"810400"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rqwg0_300","id":"RQWG0_300","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/isolated","id":"isolated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stressed","id":"stressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/abdominal","id":"abdominal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/antibiotics","id":"antibiotics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bipolar","id":"bipolar"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/colitis","id":"colitis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diagnosis","id":"diagnosis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctor","id":"doctor"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/head","id":"head"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/infection","id":"infection"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/invisible","id":"Invisible"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nursing%20care","id":"nursing care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/patient%20privacy","id":"Patient privacy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/signs","id":"signs"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/some%20staff","id":"some staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/swallowing","id":"swallowing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/transparency","id":"Transparency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ulcerative%20colitis","id":"ulcerative colitis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/psychiatrist%20availability","id":"psychiatrist availability"}]},{"id":810812,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Excellent group of Doctors.","body":"I have been with this practice for 32years.

Let down. Abandoned. Devastated. Angry. Rejected. Heartbroken.  \r\nMy husband's mental health gradually deteriorated since having a brain tumour removed twenty years ago. For the first few years, only close family and freinds would have noticed the new behaviour: self-doubt and quick temper. Over the years his mental health steadily grew worse with symptoms like verbal anger (never physical) depression, anxiety, restlessness, paranoia, suspicions, pushing friends away and self-hatred. We've recently discovered that these are possible side effects from left temporal lobe surgery, but we never made the corrolation between his neurosurgery and declining moods because we'd never been informed to look out for them.  \r\nI've written a longer history to the coroner, but very simply this year, having lost the ability to work, feel positive, believe in himself or even like himself, his mind grew sicker. He couldn't understand why I would want to stay married to him when he was such a loser. (His words) I told him I loved him and the real person was in there, but just needed help. By now he was taking three different antidepressants. In the latter weeks we were paying for a phychologist to speak to him at ¬£150 a session. Due to his health, we had lost any equity and were now renting while on Universal Credit, so this payment to talk to someone was a huge percentage of our income. We knew he didn't have the strength to wait months until an NHS mental health professional would be available.  \r\nHis first cry for help was when he disappeared in his van with only a blanket and ALL his medication in October. I called the police. They arrived and were amazing. My daughter and son-in-law are also police officers and knew that the triage car would be called. The police requested them when they'd talked him back home, but the mental health team refused to visit. I would like to know how they choose between one person's life and another's. I'd like to know who makes that life and death decision. I'd like to know who said, No.  \r\nHis second cry for help was when he drove to Belvoir Castle with clear suicide intention. I called him but he wouldn't tell me where he was and wouldn't let me meet him. I called the police, who once again were there when we needed them. He was talked into going to our son's house in an area of Nottingham, which he eventually did. The triage car with the mental health team was requested for a second time. Once again, someone said, No. Do you have records that let you know this is a sick man who wanted to take his life for a second time? The police gave him a lot of time that evening and told him that someone from the mental health team would call him. As the hours passed, he was settled in bed at our son's house. The next morning he said he had received a phone call waking him in the early hours by someone from mental health team. They asked him if he needed to go to hospital, he had been woken up and said he was in bed at his son's. Whoever spoke to him said (as he recalled)-Okay then, in that case you won't need to speak to a psychiatric nurse. Goodbye.  \r\nWho made that call? Who thought it was a good idea to ask a suicidal man whether he needed hospitalisation? Where were you?  \r\nI found my beautiful husband, father to our three children and grandfather to twin six-year-old grandaughters after he committed suicide in a traumatic way.  \r\nWhere were you?","criticality":"strongly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-12-07T10:32:43.84","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-12-15T13:23:43.443","readBy":[{"name":"Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust","count":26}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/808737","id":"808737"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/808737/responses","id":"808737"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/808737/healthservices","id":"808737"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/808737/tags","id":"808737"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rha-amh-county","id":"rha-amh-county","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/abandoned","id":"abandoned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anger","id":"anger"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/angry","id":"angry"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/antidepressants","id":"antidepressants"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/brain","id":"brain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/brain%20tumour","id":"brain tumour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/death","id":"death"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/depression","id":"depression"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/devastated","id":"devastated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/end%20of%20life","id":"end of life"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/heartbroken","id":"heartbroken"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lobe","id":"lobe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/neurosurgery","id":"neurosurgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/paranoia","id":"paranoia"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/suicidal","id":"suicidal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/suicide","id":"suicide"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/temporal","id":"temporal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/triage","id":"triage"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tumour","id":"Tumour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unheard","id":"unheard"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/explanations","id":"explanations"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/810888","id":"810888"}]},{"id":810821,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Great practice","body":"Everyone is very helpful.

I am appalled that we as a family had to work out that my mother is allergic to that particular type of antibiotics prescribed and had the Dr looked properly through her notes they surely would have discovered this.  My mother was in a terrible state and it was only through stopping taking the antibiotics she started to improve.  I have spoken to the health centre 3 times on her behalf as my mother says she could never get through.  There is a high density of elderly patients who need to use the surgery who don‚Äôt have access to the internet and who can only access the surgery by phone.  Every time I phoned I was waiting for a minimum of 20 minutes to get through to someone.  I can cope with this as I am persistent and determined!

In March they refused to continue to distribute my medication until I had a pill review. I left the number to call several times and they kept calling my old number and saying it hadn‚Äôt updated. This was all going on in my final year and around the time of my dissertation. Weeks went by and no one called me on the correct number and when I was assured multiple times someone would call me still no one did (they wouldn‚Äôt let me call them at a set time either). It took for me to have a breakdown over the phone To the receptionist for them to call me the next day (having waited all of that day for them to call me and still no one did). However the damage had been done. I went for many many weeks without my antidepressants during the most stressful time of my life. They did not handle it well and were not at all apologetic and didn‚Äôt even have a proper answer when I asked why they couldn‚Äôt send my prescription before I have the pill review. It has been 9 months since this occurred and I still have nightmares from my experience with them. I cannot put it into words how awful I felt and as a surgery who are supposed to help people in my experience they made me far worse. It went on for far too long and my mental condition dramatically deteriorated because of their refusal to send my prescription without speaking to me. A prescription which hadn‚Äôt even changed so there was no need for the review in the first place.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-12-14T22:58:13","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2020-12-15T14:53:46","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/810851","id":"810851"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/810851/responses","id":"810851"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/810851/healthservices","id":"810851"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/810851/tags","id":"810851"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l81075","id":"L81075","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/antidepressants","id":"antidepressants"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breakdown","id":"breakdown"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"}]},{"id":810849,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Currently feel unable to trust anything I've been‚Ä¶","body":"My relative is an orthopaedic inpatient.

I am also 77 and classified as clinically extremely vulnerable. I had an appointment at 2 o'clock yesterday and arrived 10 minutes prior to this. It was a long and stressful walk for me to get to the department, owing to the above conditions, wearing a mask and almost pain in my back. I had followed government advice meticulously up till this point, not going  into shops, or, critically here, pharmacies. The reason for the latter presumably being that sick people go into pharmacies, and the same could be said of hospitals, but appointments are essential. I was therefore alarmed at the waiting time, as I could feel my breathing altering, particularly presumably because of the length of time wearing the mask.( Yes, I could have removed it , but people get anxious if I do, and particularly if I start to cough).  I had worn it in the car over, with windows open and my granddaughter driving also wearing one. This was followed by a (for me) longish walk. Then there was the long waiting time. At 3.o'clock (an hour after arrival) I had asked if there was a problem, and was told they had my name. By 3.10 my breathing was altering  for the worse, and I used the Ventolin I carry at all times. I informed a nurse of my difficulties and that I needed to get some air, and added that I was clinically extremely vulnerable. She told me that I should have informed reception of this, and they would have seen me sooner! I had been told to arrive a few minutes before the appointment time, and not told that I was to inform them of being critically extremely vulnerable. I pointed out that this was on my medical records, and was told that \"we don't read those\".I was feeling quite panicky and left, followed by said nurse asking if I was alright. Obviously not! Then I was called to and told to come back, as someone could see me. I am generally told not to talk when breathing is getting bad. I needed to get outside.\nThe reason I am writing this is that the critically extremely vulnerable should be told if they are to report this, and particularly if a long wait is envisaged. Also, surely the elderly should  be seen promptly, so they spend less time around other people in the present circumstances. There was only one other elderly person waiting, and he came in with a carer at around a quarter to 3. I have regular appointments with Ophthalmology and this situation has never arisen.

We were not informed of this at any point, in fact receiving a text message the day before confirming the appointment.
