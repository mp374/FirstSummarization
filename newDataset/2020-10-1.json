I was admitted to the maternity ward on the Friday evening to start the process of induction. After receiving 3 pessaries, I was finally able to have my waters broken on the labour ward. Thank you to Paula and Laura who seen me through the induction process!  \r\nThe main midwifes that helped me through the labour and birth were Jackie and Kenny and I honestly cannot thank them enough. They were both so calm and caring, nothing was a problem and you could just tell how passionate and experienced they were in their roles. Everything went well with the labour and birth and then I unfortunately suffered a PPH just after the birth. Again, the doctor and the rest of the team that came to assist the midwifes were just incredible. Even in such an emergency situation everyone remained so calm and in control which was so reassuring for my husband and I. Once the haemorrhage was under control, the room was cleaned up within minutes and you would never have known such an event had ever happened! The next day I received a blood transfusion and my midwife was Justine. Again, she was just amazing and looked after me so well all day until I was ready to go back up to the post natal ward. I know my husband was ever so grateful to all the staff as well! All was well with my baby girl and I and we were discharged from the hospital the next day. Unfortunately we did have to return for a couple of nights due to my baby developing jaundice but once again, the staff were just amazing and helped me through this small hiccup! Again, a massive thank you to each and every member of staff that I met on the ward, I am so so grateful to every one of you, what an incredible team of staff! Some of the other names I can remember were Denise, Rachel and Lauren, I know there was more but I cannot remember their names! Thank you to you all!

We understand that this means she is unable to have visitors however, because of this we feel we have no evidence that she is being well cared for.  \r\nWe were asked by the ward to bring in clothes and toiletries, but we did not get a bag of belongings back for washing. We were told that she fell from the bed and had to have an xray, thankfully nothing was broken. The information given from the ward was that she \"shimmied to the bottom of the bed and fell out.\" My gran has dementia, but has lived a sedentary lifestyle for the last 20 years, for the last 2 years I have not seen her move unprompted by a carer or relative, so the idea of her \"shimmying\" sounds very far fetched in my Opinion. If my gran had fallen as the bed sides were not used properly, I would be happy to accept that this sometimes happens, instead, I feel we don't know the full picture.  \r\nMy gran was admitted before and we felt we had to submit a complaint as she had been left on a bedpan for more that 30 minutes and the buzzer was ringing for a further 20 minutes before a member of staff came to help (even though I heard them in the staff area discussing personal matters).  \r\nWe need reassurance that she is being well cared for as we cannot see for ourselves and she can't communicate effectively with us as she struggles with her memory.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-09-28T11:31:16.8466667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-10-01T09:31:06.237","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lanarkshire","count":6},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":1},{"name":"South Lanarkshire Health and Social Care Forum","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/790035","id":"790035"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/790035/responses","id":"790035"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/790035/healthservices","id":"790035"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/790035/tags","id":"790035"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l302h-care-of-the-elderly","id":"L302H-Care-of-the-Elderly","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20cared%20for","id":"not cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dementia","id":"dementia"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassurance","id":"reassurance"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/respect","id":"respect"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/xray","id":"Xray"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/concerned%20for%20patient%20safety","id":"concerned for patient safety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid-19","id":"covid-19"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%20test","id":"covid test"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/792356","id":"792356"}]},{"id":790149,"author":"Grateful of Edinbane","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Treatment at Portree minor injuries unit","body":"I had a fall yesterday and damaged my face. &nbsp; Within &nbsp; 40 minutes of phoning I was seen by Simon, a paramedic, who reviewed me, patched me up and sent me on my way.

They were sensitive to my Birth Plan preferences, and filled me with confidence that everything would go well during my most vulnerable moments. I was keen to have a water birth so, when the Birthing Pool was occupied during my labour, both the ensuite bath tub in my Birth Centre room and the Labour Ward Birthing pool were prepared for me. The midwives did everything they could to facilitate this wish, and it was indeed the ensuite bathtub that was used in the end.\nI have been so inspired, that I will be finding ways to support St. Mary's Birth Centre in the future, through voluntary roles or even midwife training myself.\nI hope it will be possible to return to the unit again, should I need to give birth.

I suffered a miscarriage between having my first and second child which left me very sad, lost and very anxious, said feelings of anxiousness and lots of intrusive thoughts led me to develop generalised anxiety and my doctor refereed me to the healthy minds team. I was a little skeptical at first, as I wasn't too sure the CBT Therapy would help me, but I was very much mistaken. I have benefited so much from their help. Due to covid I didn't have any face to face sessions, just telephone sessions. These were so good, I felt I was listened to and my therapists was so understanding and non judgemental with all my worries and silly thoughts. This really made me feel like I was being cared for. I looked forward to my weekly sessions so much, and the modules I was given to work through and the tips and advice I recieved have helped me really understand myself better and know that it's okay to have mental health issues. I've just finished my course of therapy and it's really been such a godsend and put me on such a stronger path then I was on before.

I guess due to covid they pulled the shutters down on consultations in person. However, I got an appointment to see a GP in person in September. I arrived 5mins before the appointment time as instructed - covid rules - and waited outside the reception.  The GP popped their head out of the door into the waiting area, shouted my name, then turned on a six pence and was off.  I assumed they wanted me to follow, but it wouldn't take much, surely, for them to say \"follow me please\".  I had to run after them, to try and find which room they'd gone to.  A ridiculous Benny Hill-esque scenario.  Luckily a door had been left open to one particular room, so I walked into that room, assuming it was right. The consultation was soulless and mechanical.  I was given the impression that I was taking up their time, because, you know, they've got patients to see. The irony was bizarre. People go to their GP for the personal touch, expecting them to talk to them and understand the issues they're facing. This was the antithesis of that. My recommendation would be to wear sports shoes and be fit if you have an appointment at this Practice because when you arrive your GP will pop out, ball your name, then run off to their room, no doubt moaning how you're eating into the time in their day. And if you want to find where they've gone, you need to be quick.

If the internal systems do not get updated, this is not the fault of the patient.  \r\nWhen trying to book my Radiotherapy, I was repeatedly asked to travel quite a distance from my home, in the height of the COVID19 pandemic, from an area with a very low infection rate, to an area with the highest rate in the county despite the treatment I required being readily available in my home town. In my opinion consideration was never given to the fact that as a single parent, I could not simply obtain childcare as we were in full lockdown and I was made to feel like the NHS targets were more of a priority to some staff than the welfare of the patient.  \r\nDuring one visit to The Parapet, one of the specialists advised me to give up smoking & they're suggestion was that I go for a long walk & that this hopefully would help me give up - I felt this was a tad naive, unrealistic and frankly insensitive. This member of staff later insulted me by stating in a letter to my GP that I had taken my daughter along to my appointment - If they had read my notes, they would have been aware that I have a young son, not a 30 year old daughter as they had assumed because a friend came along to the appointment. I believe that a little more care, attention to detail & sensitivity is required by this member of staff.  \r\nMy biggest complaint about this whole process however is the fact that not one of the professionals I spoke to prior to my surgery explained that the incision would be made around the edge of my areola/nipple area. In all of the literature that I was given by the clinic, the diagrams showed an incision across the fleshy part of the breast & I was extremely anxious about removing the dressings several weeks after surgery as I did not know what to expect - This was not it. I was unable to attend face to face appointments due to the pandemic so feel that I had no practical or emotional support from professionals and when I did call the Breast Care Nurse office with my concerns, they seemed far too busy to talk with me, refused to arrange a district nurse visit and made me feel like I was a bit of an inconvenience. I now have a permanently deformed nipple where the stitching was carelessly done and I was not given any advance warning, nor any options regarding this procedure.  \r\nFurthermore, on completion of the Radiotherapy, staff advised me that the skin around my breast may become dry & itchy during the treatment and for a few weeks afterwards. This was a complete under-statement. My nipple was essentially burnt to the extent that it went black, itched like crazy and all of the skin peeled off over the course of a couple of weeks, which was extremely uncomfortable, embarrassing and has in fact left me with blocked ducts and unsightly cysts all over my nipple that discharge white gunk. Given that I had ductal carcinoma, this has left me with more concerns about regrowth.  \r\nI felt quite let down at times & strongly feel that staff should explain all of the gory details of the surgery & treatments to the patient - The lack of information caused me shock, anxiety, tears and much distress. If staff do not feel comfortable explaining these details in depth to patients, I would suggest that they need a new career because to be left not knowing vital details about your breast cancer treatment is absolutely dreadful and has a really negative effect on your already fragile mental health & general well-being.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-09-28T13:19:20.61","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-10-01T10:27:20","readBy":[{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2021)","count":1},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2022)","count":1},{"name":"Frimley Health NHS Foundation Trust","count":1},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2020)","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/790073","id":"790073"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/790073/responses","id":"790073"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/790073/healthservices","id":"790073"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/790073/tags","id":"790073"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rdu53_103","id":"rdu53_103","score":4},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxious","id":"anxious"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/inconvenience","id":"inconvenience"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/insulted","id":"insulted"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appointments","id":"appointments"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/better%20attention","id":"better attention"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breast","id":"breast"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breast%20cancer","id":"breast cancer"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cancer","id":"cancer"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cancer%20treatment","id":"cancer treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/carcinoma","id":"carcinoma"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/consultant","id":"consultant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cysts","id":"cysts"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dressings","id":"dressings"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/incision","id":"incision"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/infection","id":"infection"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lumpectomy","id":"Lumpectomy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nipple","id":"nipple"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/radiotherapy","id":"radiotherapy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sensitivity","id":"sensitivity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/service%20availability","id":"service availability"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attitude","id":"staff attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stitching","id":"stitching"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/uncomfortable","id":"uncomfortable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/on%20edge","id":"on edge"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dreadful","id":"dreadful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid-19","id":"covid-19"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/791282","id":"791282"}]},{"id":790538,"author":"Antoninus","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Venesection Clinic","body":"I have been attending this clinic weekly since February to give blood.

My named midwife was Amy who I saw at nearly all my appointments. Being a naturally shy and reserved person, I felt confident and comfortable to be able to ask questions about pregnancy and birth. Having continuity of care helped talking about bodily functions and answering the midwife’s questions about it which you normally would not talk about.  \r\nI went in to labour on my due date and saw my midwife twice that day at the antenatal clinic and in the midwife unit when my waters had broken. While I was at the midwife unit, I had what felt like a long continuous contraction and Amy took me straight down in to triage. Amy had a calm and professional manner throughout.  \r\nWhile I was in triage, I was found to be 4-5cm dilated so I went straight on to the labour ward. On the labour ward I had Debi as my midwife for the rest of my labour and the birth of my baby. Debi kept me informed throughout the labour about what she was doing, why she was doing it and gaining consent to do it. Debi was very attentive throughout labour, I expressed pain at one point as the baby had kicked quite hard and it caught me of guard even though I'd had an epidural and straight away, she was asking what’s wrong?  \r\nAlthough I ended up having an emergency cesarean section it was still a pleasant experience. The anaesthetist explained what was happening and talked about having a spinal anaesthetic and the pros of that. My surgery was carried out by Dr Anderson and the theatre team all introduced themselves to me and my partner in theatre, so we knew who was in the room which was a pleasant touch. The doctor beside me told me what was going on in the surgery and confirmed my baby was a boy and the weight he thought he was roughly around while I was waiting for my baby to be passed to me. I didn’t have any complications from the surgery apart from a bit of moderate bleeding in recovery which Dr Anderson quickly resolved.  \r\nOur first home visit was by a midwife I’m sure was called Elizabeth and she spent a great deal of time with us helping me to hand expressed as baby stopped latching on to breast. Although breast feeding didn’t go as planned , I did get a lot of support from Debi and the midwives and care assistants on the post-natal ward even though I’m sure they were busy, they made time to help me. Although baby never latched back on to breast, we combi fed for a little while using hand expression that Elizabeth showed to me and using an electric pump.  \r\nI’d like to thank all the midwives, doctors and care assistants involved in our maternity care.  \r\nI had my baby at the end of 2019 before COVID 19 arrived in Scotland.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-09-28T22:35:59.4766667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-10-01T11:58:06.147","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":6},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/790302","id":"790302"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/790302/responses","id":"790302"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/790302/healthservices","id":"790302"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/790302/tags","id":"790302"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/c418h_501","id":"C418H_501","score":5},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/c418h-labsuitematernity","id":"c418h-labsuitematernity","score":5},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/c418h-matcare1","id":"c418h-matcare1","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anaesthetic","id":"Anaesthetic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/antenatal","id":"antenatal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breast%20feeding","id":"breast feeding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/continuity","id":"continuity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/continuity%20of%20care","id":"continuity of care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/epidural","id":"epidural"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/knowledge","id":"knowledge"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/labour","id":"labour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/maternity","id":"maternity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/midwives","id":"midwives"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/positive","id":"positive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pregnancy","id":"pregnancy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/spinal%20anaesthetic","id":"spinal anaesthetic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/calm","id":"calm"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confident","id":"confident"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported","id":"supported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/793457","id":"793457"}]},{"id":790298,"author":"krystos","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"lump between my shoulder blades","body":"due to covid restrictions, my GP has been dismissive of a growth on my back so when the pain became too much, i visited the minor injuries unit in gravesend.  \r\nto put it simply, the team was brilliant! from arrival at the door to entry to triage then treatment, i can't say enough how efficient the team were.

I felt completely in control and listened to in the time when I was most vulnerable, giving birth for the first time. I was able to use the birthing pool and the midwives set up an environment where I was able to relax as much as possible.  \r\nI have just had my second baby at RAH, albeit during a pandemic. I arrived at 10pm. I cannot fault the midwives as they were great once again however I was supposed to be community midwife led again and was told during full blown labour that they were very busy and so had closed the cmu.  \r\nAdditionally to that my husband was not allowed past the front doors of the hospitals leaving me (a couple of hours from birth) to have to navigate up to cmu breathing through my contractions myself , to be turned away saying they're closed. I then had to get on the lift again myself to be told to go to triage and sit in a waiting area to be seen. Meanwhile I was using my breathing techniques that I had been taught and pacing as much as I could. I had to eventually ring the bell to be assessed as I knew birth was imminent.  \r\nI was eventually taken to an assessment room where my husband was able to join me about 10.40pm. We were transferred to a labour suite when one became available about 11.20pm. I was not able to have the birthing pool I had wanted but they did try and keep it as 'green pathway' as possible by using the heartbeat doppler as opposed to the belly monitor. My second daughter was born a half hour later.  \r\nIt was definitely not the training experience it should have been however midwives did their best with the resources they had to make it as comfortable as possible.  \r\nI cannot stress how important having the cmu open is.
