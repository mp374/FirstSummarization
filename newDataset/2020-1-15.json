","body":"After waiting approximately 18 weeks for a 1st appointment, I was seen & advised I would be reviewed after 3 months. I eventually received an appointment at the 6 month stage for a date in mid January 2020. Then at the beginning of Jan 2020 I received a 2nd follow up appointment date for the end of June 2020. Being confused I rang to check only to be told the January date had been cancelled. I advised them I had not received any communication cancelling this appointment & asked for reasons for cancellation as the new date left me with a 12 month gap between 1st appointment & follow up review. I expressed my concerns that I thought this was unreasonable. After asking for notification in writing of cancelled appointment as reasons could not be given, I was assured I would receive notification by post.\nI immediately contacted PALS to register my concerns & was promised a call back that same day to address my concerns after they had spoken to the relevant department. I am still waiting. with modern technology there are numerous ways for contacting people this has not happened. I do not think a 12 month wait is acceptable for a follow up appointment as it is effectively a 'New' 1st appointment due to time lapse between appointments.

I was relieved to hear that I was only fifth in the queue, as I have not been able to get an appointment recently, they were always booked up when I phoned, and they would not let me book an appointment. When my turn came, the phone line went dead at their end. I had no choice but to call back, I phoned back immediately, only a few minutes past 8, unfortunately this put me at 33 in the queue. When I finally got through, I was told that all the appointments with the particular GP I wanted to see were booked up, that I would have to see a different GP or a nurse. I purposefully called today, at 8 am sharp in order to get that particular appointment, through no fault of my own, it was the practice's phone line, I was unable to get my appointment. In the time it took me to explain this situation, all of the other appointment slots with other practitioners were booked up, and now I am left stranded with nothing but tears. This place has lost its compassion and humanity. I have been a patient at this practice for almost ten years. It used to be fairly straightforward to get an appointment, and get the help my family and I needed. This has drastically changed in the recent years. We can no longer make appointments ahead of time, and it is virtually impossible to see a particular GP, which is very difficult for patients who feel more comfortable seeing particular health professionals. Asking to make an appointment with a particular person should not be too much to ask for, it never used to be. It is very easy to see how people fall though the cracks of this system, especially when they are at their most vulnerable and at their weakest.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-01-15T09:58:50","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2020-01-15T10:13:10","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/731255","id":"731255"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/731255/responses","id":"731255"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/731255/healthservices","id":"731255"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/731255/tags","id":"731255"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/d83082","id":"D83082","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vulnerable","id":"vulnerable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/relieved","id":"relieved"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"}]},{"id":731258,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Efficiency","body":"Admitted myself to A&E with severe upper abdo pain.

They can’t believe the change in me. I’m happier and contented and lovable. I used to hate everybody and now I can talk to people and tell them anything, and I know they will listen and not judge me. I won’t be ashamed to tell them. By doing this I think I’ve tried to break down this stigma about mental health.  \r\nMy physical health has improved and in the last year my whole aspect of my life has changed. Before I went to the Recovery College, I was terrified of change but now I realise change is necessary for recovery. I’ve changed 100%.  \r\nThere are people out there to look after and help you. I’ve now got the coping skills and strategy to help me with my life. I’ve met people from all walks of life. You are at the Recovery College to recover whoever you are.  \r\nI did 22 courses and graduated from the college in December 2019 and now I’m going to become a volunteer to help others and give them the chance that I’ve had. Mindfulness and journalling courses were unbelievable, if you are in the moment you are looking at yourself and not at others focusing on yourself. Giving yourself a chance to look at your life and look what lies ahead.  \r\nI can’t thank them enough.

We met with a group of service users and talked about theirexperiences and thoughts of the service.  \r\nThe service users who tookpart in the session talked about different activities they attend at the DayService. Although all the sessions were found to be helpful some more enjoyablethan others.  \r\nThe activity that seems to be the most popular is theRelaxation group which recently has been moved from Tuesdays to Fridays. Thischange in the activity schedule was seen as particularly beneficial, especiallythat it was no longer followed by a CBT workshop. The other two sessions thatwere perceived as enjoyable were the Creative group and Cooking group. Theparticipants told us the Creative group involved a variety of activities whichhelped break-up the more intense sessions. The Cooking group allows serviceusers to make their own suggestions of the meals they would like to prepare andstaff are very supportive.  \r\nA couple of sessions were seen as both enjoyable andhelpful. These were the Motivation group and Nutrition group.  \r\nThe helpful, more intense and less pleasant courses were; CBT,Body Image, Relationships and Meal planning.  \r\nCBT was described as repetitive and not always helpful,although it was also recognised that it might just be that it isn’t suitablefor everyone. The other three sessions, although seen as less enjoyable, help toput things in perspective and the participants felt supported and understood bystaff. The group agreed that although some workshops might be more intense thanothers there is a reason why they are on the programme and they are veryhelpful and needed in recovery.  \r\nDuring group sessions the participants felt that staffalways checked in on individuals and that they were always made to feel thatyou were able to pull a staff member aside for some individual time if youdidn’t want to talk during the group sessions.  \r\nThe Recovery App was found to be really quick and easy touse. One participant felt it was more useful at the start but as they had beenpart of the service for a longer time they used it less, another found thatthey were still finding it really useful even though they had been part of theservice for approximately the same amount of time.  \r\nAlthough the whole service was described as extremelyhelpful and not needing much improvement, there were a few things that werementioned as ‘could be better or different’. Some group members felt that themeal planning could be done on a one-to-one basis rather than in a groupsetting. Though there was an understanding that some time was already given tothis is key working sessions if you wanted it.  \r\nThe two main things that stood out as needing improvementwere a bigger kitchen and another toilet to be available. The smallness of the kitchen meant that atbusy times you all feel squashed in there together and it can be quite anxietyprovoking and that the small table can feel overwhelming when busy.  \r\nOverall the Day Service was described as a really goodstarting point and helpful for their recovery. The staff were seen as very supportive andunderstanding. All the service users felt that they were involved in decisionmaking and that they had a final word on their length of stay.","criticality":"minimally

I was having a hard time at work and I would be crying before I went and after I left, feeling like I was just posing as someone who was good at their job and also being told by management that my department was failing because of one aspect of my role which I found incredibly hard.  \r\nI also had issues with the way I looked and my weight, feeling like I was not good enough and that I did not deserve to be liked. I felt like most people could not see past my weight and could not see that I was a kind, generous person at heart and that my weight does not define me.  \r\nI started my mental health care sessions whist at my lowest point, it has changed my life and I wish I had done it sooner. My therapist made me feel like I was the one in control and made me see my worth.  \r\nI am now able to challenge my thoughts so I do not think the worst is going to happen, I am starting to see my positive attributes and I am also taking more time for myself.  \r\nI could not of wished for a better outcome, everyone I know says I have changed, I have a more positive outlook on life and I feel like I can finally live my life without being scared of what might happen in the future.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-01-14T14:27:40.91","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-01-15T11:52:31.81","readBy":[{"name":"Midlands Partnership NHS Foundation Trust","count":4},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2021)","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/730695","id":"730695"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/730695/responses","id":"730695"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/730695/healthservices","id":"730695"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/730695/tags","id":"730695"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rrex4-inclusion-thurrock","id":"rrex4-inclusion-thurrock","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/empathy","id":"empathy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good","id":"good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/in%20control","id":"in control"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/knowledgeable","id":"knowledgeable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/life%20changing","id":"life changing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/positive","id":"positive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/work","id":"work"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/positivity","id":"Positivity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/body%20image","id":"body image"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/759113","id":"759113"}]},{"id":730711,"author":"The Box Man","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Catheter Ablation","body":"  \r\nThought I would write in and commend the work of Dr Robinson, the EP who led the team which carried out a catheter ablation procedure in January.

I first saw one GP as the only available appointment and from my first appointment with him he provided me consistency, care, reassurance. He became my regular GP and had supported me through a difficult year. He seemed to genuinely care, from reading all my notes before my first appointment to keeping up to speed with how things were going by reviewing my records before my next appointment. He has chased things up for me, he made me feel listened to, at each contact has done a holistic assessment and considered everything, not just looking at one small thing when they could all be related. Even when running late or a late evening appointment I felt I was given the time to talk through things/deal with my issue, not feeling rushed or an inconvenience. \nHaving never had any health issues (other than the odd childhood thing when younger), I genuinely feel so happy that I had such a positive experience and truly feel that this is what a GP should be like. \nI can not thank him enough and the care I have been shown, even when my health issues may be a drop in the ocean to what some people may be going through, is next level and I have been listened to and felt my overall well being had been considered and put at the forefront.\nMy last appt he was running 40 mins late due to no fault of his own but was not made to feel rushed or an inconvenience and was in around 20 minutes, I made a comment about trying to be quick so he wasn’t late home to his family but he said it didn’t matter as his patients need his care. \nHe’s approachable, professional, caring and passionate. Excellent communication skills. The other practice staff such as secretaries have also been great and kept me informed when they have chased or made referrals on his behalf. I can not recommend the practice enough and want to thank this GP who is now my named GP having dealt with me for the past year. The NHS is taken for granted, and being a nurse myself I know the strain and pressure it’s under, however this has not influenced the care I’ve received.

Was on painkillers prescribed by GP, however the pains worsened and spread. Went to Chase Farm urgent care centre. There wasn't a doctor in attendance but a triage nurse. Was there for 2 hours, others were there longer without having been seen. We saw the nurse put his jacket on and leave. My husband decided to take me to Barnet A&E. It was crowded, there was nowhere to sit. Waited at the queue for reception for 15 or so minutes. It wasn't moving. Was in terrible pain I had to leave and go home. A few days later worsened more. My son came and took me to University College hospital. What a contrast. Within 2 hours was seen by a qualified doctor, checked, x-rayed and prescribed stronger painkillers. This has been a great help. I am now able to walk around the house and no longer have to rely on my husband to lift me in and out of bed or a chair and to bring my food upstairs. Since approx. 20th December my GP had referred me to a muscular/skeletal specialist. Chase Farm wanted me to go to back class! I need to be scanned to see what has happened to me. I was a fit and healthy person. The state of emergency services run by Royal Free health authority is terrible. It is badly run and management is atrocious. A&E's are understaffed. The staff do their best if you ever manage to see them but they are in an impossible situation. Perhaps the health authority can take lessons from the properly run west end hospitals who are and always excellent.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-01-15T12:32:13","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2020-01-15T12:39:47","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/731322","id":"731322"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/731322/responses","id":"731322"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/731322/healthservices","id":"731322"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/731322/tags","id":"731322"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/ral","id":"RAL","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bed%20lift","id":"bed lift"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency","id":"emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/get%20fit","id":"get fit"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/painkillers","id":"painkillers"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/terrible","id":"terrible"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/triage","id":"triage"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"}]},{"id":731323,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Non-NHS services ","body":"Appointment for 11:00am for a medical test to renew my professional drivers permit.

I was booked in by a phone call on the day before my appointment on 7 Jan 2020. I was naturally extremely apprehensive on my arrival at the hospital but was met with continuously kind understanding. From the volunteer who showed me where I had to go, to the brilliant doctor, each talked to me as though for that moment they actually cared about me - which is such a comforting feeling when you are in such a frightening situation. The difference was that each person I went to, the lovely lady who did my mammogram and the lady that was training in the ultra sound section all took their time and chatted to me as if they knew me. Despite being extremely professional they were very personable too which made me relax and feel safe. The whole service overall is fantastic, being able to have all of the checks and the results in one visit is so much less stressful than having to await further appointments. I was lucky, mine was a cyst - which the very efficient and lovely doctor drained with a single sharp scratch. So I would like to thank each and every person who was involved in my care.

The open visiting is ideal.  \r\nI wanted to write to say a huge thanks to everyone on the ward.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-01-14T18:22:58.3366667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-01-15T13:01:30.963","readBy":[{"name":"Scottish Government","count":3},{"name":"NHS Fife","count":10},{"name":"Fife Health & Social Care Partnership","count":3},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/730743","id":"730743"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/730743/responses","id":"730743"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/730743/healthservices","id":"730743"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/730743/tags","id":"730743"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/f704h_340","id":"F704H_340","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/chest","id":"chest"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cleanliness","id":"cleanliness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctors","id":"doctors"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/food","id":"food"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helpful","id":"helpful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nursing%20staff","id":"nursing staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/open%20visiting","id":"open visiting"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/well%20looked%20after","id":"well looked after"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appreciated","id":"appreciated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/733357","id":"733357"}]},{"id":730714,"author":"fellow","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"They did not answer the nurse call buzzers","body":"i had the misfortune of staying in ward 1 at hairmyres recently.  \r\nthe staff were rude and did not answer the nurse call buzzers and when they did they acted like I had done something wrong. there seemed to be a clear lack of team work and respect among the staff. they forced me to wake up and get washed at 6am!  \r\nthey acted like there the entitled and its shocking. i spoke with a student nurse who said that it was the worst placement they had ever been on and that the ward has this reputation  \r\ni sincerely hope i never have to step foot in that ward ever again.!","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-01-14T14:59:55.0533333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-01-15T13:05:12.543","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lanarkshire","count":13},{"name":"Scottish Government","count":1},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":1},{"name":"South Lanarkshire Health and Social Care Forum","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/730714","id":"730714"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/730714/responses","id":"730714"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/730714/healthservices","id":"730714"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/730714/tags","id":"730714"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l302h_110","id":"L302H_110","score":2},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disgusted","id":"disgusted"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/attitude","id":"attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/patient-centred","id":"patient-centred"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sick","id":"sick"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sleep","id":"sleep"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/teamwork","id":"teamwork"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ignored%20buzzer","id":"ignored buzzer"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/731732","id":"731732"}]},{"id":730716,"author":"wallstreet","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"the most amazing nurses","body":"if you need good care and pleasant staff then Hairmyres outpatients is the place to get it.

Fortunately, my husband had called 999 when he found me and the ambulance had arrived pretty swiftly and taken me into hospital.  \r\nFortunately I was discharged from hospital shortly after 0900 hrs but with 3 staples in my head, a broken right collar bone, fractured left ribs and severe bruising.  \r\nAlthough I have no memory of the incident, my husband said how well I was looked after by the paramedics who attended me so promptly after he had called 999.  \r\nAlso the subsequent care given me by GRH when I saw a Trauma Consultant was excellent.  \r\nI have now fully recovered and am very thankful for the care I was given by the NHS.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-01-14T18:06:37.4933333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-01-15T13:36:36.467","readBy":[{"name":"Plymouth University Urgent and Emergency Care Bsc (2020)","count":1},{"name":"Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust","count":1},{"name":"South Western Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/730738","id":"730738"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/730738/responses","id":"730738"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/730738/healthservices","id":"730738"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/730738/tags","id":"730738"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rte03_110","id":"RTE03_110","score":5},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rte03_180","id":"RTE03_180","score":5},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/ryf-emergency","id":"RYF-emergency","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/traumatic","id":"traumatic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bone","id":"bone"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/broken","id":"broken"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bruising","id":"bruising"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/collar%20bone","id":"collar bone"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fall","id":"fall"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/head","id":"head"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/injury","id":"injury"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/looked%20after","id":"looked after"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/memory","id":"memory"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/paramedics","id":"paramedics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/prompt","id":"prompt"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ribs","id":"ribs"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/shoulder%20injury","id":"shoulder injury"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/well%20looked%20after","id":"well looked after"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thankful","id":"Thankful"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/752737","id":"752737"}]},{"id":731342,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Excellent service","body":"Good web site, easy to use.

My Gastro consultant had mentioned I had a problem with nausea so the goal was to try and sort this.  \r\nAfter we had discussed my symptoms and agreed that the Pancreas problem I had was causing a few of my problems including me struggling to eat the doctor gave me two options available at the centre. One was Homeopathic treatment for the nausea to be taken once a day or I could attend as a day patient for a course to learn breathing, relaxation and coping strategies to deal with my situation. I decided to try the Homeopathic route even though there was no guarantee it would work.  \r\nI explained to the doctor that I would prefer it if my consultant could figure out what my problem was and then deal with it and then I may not have the symptoms anymore. The doctor seemed happy enough with my reason for not accepting the invitation to do the. course.  \r\nAnother reason I didn't chose the course was I had previously spent four months under the care of a Chinese doctor undertaking acupuncture and Chinese medicine.  \r\nOn the suggestion of my Gastro consultant last year I started practicing meditation.
