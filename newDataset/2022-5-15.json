Ill fitting paper masks have been shown, in many RCT's, to have virtually no impact on the spread of SARS-COV-2.\n\nAfter being sent back to the waiting room, I was eventually triaged by a different member of staff who advised that they  did not have the facilities to attend to my ailment and sent me back to the A&E dept at UHNM. Funny, but staff at A&E had just redirected me to the Heywood in the first place. Needless to say, I didn't bother going back to A&E.\n\nCome on senior management, scrap this mask mandate. Hardly anyone is wearing them outside an NHS setting. You have just made a very anxious patient with a potentially life changing serious health concern very worried about getting treatment elsewhere in the NHS.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-05-13T22:08:53","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-05-15T10:50:50","readBy":[{"name":"Staffordshire and Stoke on Trent Partnership NHS Trust","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/939145","id":"939145"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/939145/responses","id":"939145"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/939145/healthservices","id":"939145"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/939145/tags","id":"939145"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/r1e56","id":"R1E56","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxious","id":"anxious"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/concern","id":"concern"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disappointed","id":"disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/worried","id":"worried"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/face","id":"face"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ill","id":"ill"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20disappointed","id":"very disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20worried","id":"not worried"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/face%20covering","id":"face covering"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/under%20pressure","id":"under pressure"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/942294","id":"942294"}]},{"id":939146,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"brilliant and responsive as ever","body":"Easy to contact, helpful reception staff and rapid response from Doctor to arrange sample and  with prescription sent straight to pharmacy.

She has been consistently helpful, sympathetic and is a great rheumatologist who I would recommend to anyone.\n\nSadly, even her great treatment can’t make up for how bad Connect Health has been. I summarise the 3 biggest problems below.\n\n1. There appears to be no communication between Connect Health and Herts Valleys NHS Trust. I was not actually told after my first appointment that I was being treated via Connect Health - indeed, most staff at St Albans City Hospital seem entirely unaware this contract exists, or that someone with an autoimmune disease might be under Connect Health (CH) care. This resulted in a farcical few weeks where I rang the hospital regarding future appointments and tests, and was told the hospital had not seen me since 2012! Why are appointments via CH at the hospital apparently going unrecorded by the hospital? Why are patients not being told we need to contact CH, not the hospital, regarding our care?\n2. CH are poor at updating my GP about what is going on with my care. They often do not send them my test results. When they do send them, they often send them to my old GP, where I have made clear to them I am no longer registered. When I ring CH to ask for my (routine, regular) test results, they often refuse to give me them or even to read them out to me on the phone, saying I need a doctor to interpret them. I am a 26 year old adult woman who has these tests twice a year at least. We are testing for the same things each time and I understand what the results mean by now. It is deeply patronising that the powers that be at CH will not provide me with my own healthcare data. I know that other services provide this, as my husband also has an autoimmune disease that requires him to undergo regular blood tests, and he is sent his results directly after each one without issue.\n3. CH often seem confused about who I am and intermittently can’t find my records when I ring them up. They are also bad at booking my appointments - in summer 2021 I was told I would not be seen by my Dr until early 2022. In September 2021, I got a letter from the NHS asking why I had missed my appointment that week. I had missed it because CH had made me one without telling me! The letter I was then sent about my rescheduled appointment in Feb 2022 had the wrong time on it, so Watford Hospital were very confused when I turned up. Telephone appointments during Covid were also of poor quality - I was allocated several very nice physios to speak to who were, rightly, honest that they couldn’t comment on UCTD because they are not rheumatologists. While this is not their fault, it meant the appointments became pointless chats about my health with some nice strangers!

He took time to go through everything in detail and was kind, thoughtful and reassuring, and we agreed on medication to tackle one thing shown up by the blood tests. After blood pressure monitoring for a week I received another call to discuss the results. Again, that same GP was informative and empathetic and we once again agreed on medication to tackle this second issue, as well as on a referral to a specialist to check on any potential underlying causes.

Due to the delayed nature of her discharge from St Peters some of the meds she should have brought home were used in hospital while others were issued from ward stock so she had too little of some meds and too much of others. For one in particular she had only a four day supply so I endeavoured to get more via Studholme. My lack of understanding of the prescription process led to some difficulties which your staff overcame! However, although I was only asking for one medication you sent requests to Boots for all 6 on her list to be issued! This resulted in the issue of some expensive drugs of which we already had more than was required. I will, of course, return the excess medication to Boots, but I'm sure handling charges will have been incurred. I feel that if someone had actually listened to my request rather than making assumptions this situation could have been avoided.\n\nSecondly, while I understand the doctors and other staff are operating under unprecedented pressure, not everyone who phones the surgery wants to make an appointment and a separate line for enquiries would serve both patients and staff well.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-05-15T14:53:24","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2022-05-16T10:05:18","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/939283","id":"939283"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/939283/responses","id":"939283"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/939283/healthservices","id":"939283"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/939283/tags","id":"939283"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/h81009","id":"H81009","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20listened%20to","id":"not listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/drugs","id":"drugs"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/expensive%20drugs","id":"expensive drugs"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doing%20well","id":"doing well"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/listened%20to","id":"listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20home","id":"at home"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/under%20pressure","id":"under pressure"}]},{"id":938723,"author":"VS1989","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"I would not hesitate in recommending the unit","body":"I chose Peterhead to give birth in as I had heard good things about the unit, I was supported by the midwife I had seen throughout my pregnancy and a student who had requested to be at my birth and they were absolutely brilliant.  \r\nUnfortunately because I was not progressing I had to be transferred to Aberdeen but it was so nice that the student midwife came with me to Aberdeen and stayed right through till after my baby was born, just having a face that I knew there was really comforting and she did such a good job of keeping me calm.  \r\nWe had issues with breastfeeding after being discharged so one of the midwives visited us at home every day and spent hours helping with our breastfeeding problems and giving reassurance.  \r\nMyself and my husband were blown away with the time and effort put into helping us and being our first baby we were so grateful for all the help.

I have never witnessed a group of people working together so well as a team.

Pharmacist advise suggested cumberland or 111. As I was near the cumberland centre i started there but received only what I can call a robotic and frosty response from reception,  unwilling to engage in a human level conversation. Please remember not everyone is a drunk or a time waster and that reception is the first impression people receive. When you approach two receptionists who seem primed to deal with such people, it's very offputting and unhelpful. Trying to be a good mum  do the right thing for my son and not waste their time I left and called 111. I was given a very helpful response and told treatment would be necessary  so to return to the cumberland. She stressed i should inform them a referral is being sent across. I tried to start the conversation by explaining my 111 information to the second receptionist and again received the same frosty robotic response, interrupting me for  information before pointing me to sit down. I said I wasn't sure if she had heard that I'd been told to tell her about the referral. She wasn't interested at all and said you'll be treated like everyone else. At no point was I expecting any different and was simply trying to do what I'd been advised to do from 111 (where I'd provided much more information than to reception).\n\nAfter being told my son would have to wait 3.5 hours to see someone, my daughter and husband had returned home. Is it really so difficult to use a few more words and actually engage with patients? Perhaps you'll see triage within 30 minutes and then will wait for further treatment if necessary.  My son probably saw triage within 20 minutes. An extremely friendly lady who spoke to my son and put him at ease. She sought a second opinion and we left within 10 minutes after basic treatment. She gave a very scared 6 year old a great impression of the NHS.\n\n It wasn't busy,  in fact in the time we were there perhaps one other person came in. I can see how some people wouldn't bother coming back after the reception  received. Please remember you are dealing with humans. You might not like your job, you probably have to deal with lots of difficult people but it's not necessary to treat everyone the same.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-05-15T16:49:37","progress":"Unread

Once again the appointment was made in Ipswich and the operation carried out with no problems. In January this year I found that the vision in my right eye was not as clear as my left eye, I contacted Newmedica and went to their Bury St Edmunds clinic to have it checked. They said that everything seemed to be ok and that the vision should return to normal in a few weeks.

I've never had issues previously with booking appts, the doctors have been excellent and receptionists always very helpful.  But recently its been a nightmare, firstly it takes over an 1 hour to get through and ask for an appt by that time all appts are gone, only to be told by receptionist that you can come in at 8am or 1pm to book an appt, I think its quite unreasonable to ask someone who is unwell to come in to make an appt, clearly they would not be calling for an appt if they were well.  Receptionist was rude and no empathy at all, I repeated something twice as she was not listening to me and she goes on to tell me I'm not professional.  I told her I appreciate what she is saying and I also work in the same environment and there is a way of how you speak to patients, I understand its not her fault but I have been trying for 3 weeks to get an appointment.  When I asked if I could leave a message for the doctor she refused saying its her job to book the appt not the GPs, I'm not asking the GP to book an appt but to merely leave a message for him.. Practice's are constantly promoting patient wellbeing but its unfortunate that reception staff don't seem to have the basic emotions or skills on how to speak to a patient. From someone who is struggling with mental health currently this does not help me at all. What worries is me how vulnerable patients who have no one else to wait for them at the practice   to make an appt are being treated.  I understand the pandemic has not helped matters but having worked myself throughout the pandemic I have always done my upmost to help patients as its not been easy for anyone.\nBut the Doctors and Nurses at Summerfield have always been caring and helpful.\nReception staff however need some training on some basic skills.

I have had had three successive physio appointments, (one by telephone and two in person of 10 mins and 3 mins respectively) each one months apart. In all of that time I have only received a youtube video and told to perform exercises, some of which were completely impractical for me. The physio appointments can best be described as cursory and I was sent an app which, despite ringing twice, I could not open as my details were not recognised. (Probably because my name was spelt incorrectly in the email sent to me). Also, the first in person appointment was largely taken up by my repeating the information I had already supplied in the online pre-appointment questionnaire.\nI have now been passed on to another member of the \"team\" (not a doctor or consultant themselves) and will incur another 6 week wait. The purpose of that appointment is not clear, but the outcome, if any, will presumably result in another lengthy delay.\nSo, including my inital appointment with my doctor, I will have had (and waited for) 5 appointments over 9 months and I still will not have been seen by a specialist. My particular issue was never going to be resolved with exercises but I have to go through the pretence that it will be. I am still not on any appropriate waiting list, but I guess that is the whole point of this exercise.     \nThe service is about as impersonal and minimalist as health care can get. No one is overseeing or in charge of progressing patients' cases. Your grandiloquent overview statement proclaims that your service is consultant-led but there is no evidence of that as far as I can see.\nCan you give me a realistic estimate of how long it will be before I receive any treatment?\n\n","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-05-16T09:47:34","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-05-16T11:37:52","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/939365","id":"939365"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/939365/responses","id":"939365"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/939365/healthservices","id":"939365"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/939365/tags","id":"939365"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/nmg","id":"NMG","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/exercise","id":"exercise"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/physio","id":"physio"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/939918","id":"939918"}]},{"id":939364,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Dreadful","body":"I echo the poor reviews already given.\nA number of letters written to practice manager and partners, however to-date not even the courtesy of a response.\nAppointments given weeks in the future which has necessitated non emergency visits to hospital.\nReception: On occasion courteous and professional, however the opposite is true more often than not.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-05-16T09:55:02","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2022-05-16T11:38:12","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/939364","id":"939364"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/939364/responses","id":"939364"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/939364/healthservices","id":"939364"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/939364/tags","id":"939364"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/e84006","id":"E84006","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/echo","id":"echo"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency","id":"emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"}]},{"id":938773,"author":"giraffexw63","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Dignity during what is a vulnerable time for any woman","body":"I was induced at the PRM (Princess Royal Maternity Hospital) earlier this year to give birth to my first child.
