When my regular Dr who left the Surgery - Service I've had now Basically Nothing, No Regular Appointments. \n\nEven now after Covid-19 Restrictions - still Extremely Bad Services Without Regular Appointments, Non Consistently Care. \n\n\nSecond of all. \n\nNovember 2022.\n\nMy Enablement Support Worker phone up Dr Surgery, the worker Weren't Impress that we had to wait entire Week for like mh Assessment etc. \n\nA week later (without any Appointment Time apart from day) I had phone call from mh (Mental Health) nurse, I did inform that phone were breaking up at the beginning of consultation, mh Nurse did repeat what I said. Instead of saying right I will phone you back. The Mh Nurse kept on having consultation, I kept saying phone breaking up, half of the time I didn't get the gist what being said due to phone line still breaking up. Next second Phone line eventually cut off. Mh Nurse Did Not phone back at all. The call lasted approx under 5min.\n\nI then informed the Worker who made the appointment for me - the Worker response were they felt disappointed, angry, frustrated - mainly on my behalf. \n\nThe worker informed me that they (the worker) rang up surgery following day, asking for the Surgery to phone the worker up to discuss what happens etc. The surgery not phone the worker Back. In my eyes I bet that phone call back possible won't even happened. \n\n\n\nVerdict of this Surgery \n\nAbsolutely Jokes, Non Caring, Non Consistent Care. Borderline on Rudeness, Lazy. \n\nThis surgery gone much More Downhill Over The Years. I were with yourself at Ashgate from 2007 ish - I had Much Better Services Back Then. Even when Dr left for Maternity Leave or Leave to work somewhere else, each Regular Dr made sure I would received the same Kind Consistent Service with regular Appointments with different Dr (end up with another regular) til my Main  Regular come back after Maternity. \n\nNow 2022\n\nI'm extremely seriously thinking of changing surgery.

She undertook a thorough assessment and from then on kept us appraised of the sequence of events every 20 minutes so that we were not left in the dark. Her bedside manner, and that of the nurses was just so reassuring and empathetic that my mother felt at ease the whole time. The person who registered my wife and I in the waiting room was similarly professional - there was a lady ahead of us who only spoke Italian and he made a point of seeking out a doctor who could converse in the language. The total time in hospital was around 4-5 hours and although most of that time was spent in the hallway, the experience was a positive one and an immense improvement on our previous visit 2 years ago.

If he was still having problems in a week or two, he's to arrange to see James face-to-face.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-11-16T16:31:30.4866667","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2022-11-20T15:20:00.72","readBy":[],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/998006","id":"998006"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/998006/responses","id":"998006"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/998006/healthservices","id":"998006"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/998006/tags","id":"998006"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/c86017","id":"C86017","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/follow%20up","id":"follow up"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/neck%20pain","id":"neck pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20rushed","id":"not rushed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/physio","id":"physio"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pleasant","id":"pleasant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/shoulder%20pain","id":"shoulder pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/speed","id":"speed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thoroughness","id":"thoroughness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confident","id":"confident"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hopeful","id":"hopeful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/clear%20instructions","id":"clear instructions"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/listened%20to","id":"listened to"}]},{"id":999405,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Excellent practice","body":"I am very pleased with the service this GP provides.

I’m young and well so I haven’t needed anything until this month, where a lump on my arm quickly became very painful.\n\nI phoned on a Thursday evening and managed to get an appointment with a GP for the coming Monday, which I thought was brilliant. The GP I saw was professional and thorough, but also kind.\n\nAfter a course of antibiotics I went back to the practice where this time I met one of the nurses. They were fab, exceptionally personable and caring. I have since had to see the same nurse quite a few times for follow-ups and it’s lovely that we now just have a nice chat and catch-up while the appointment takes place.\n\nIn addition to this, the reception staff have always been friendly and helpful with me, be it over the phone or in person.\n\nAside from the great staff, I am most impressed with how easily I can get an appointment when needed. They will always try their best to get me seen if it needs to be that day, or book me in soon after if they can’t. They also make every effort to work around my shift patterns which I hugely appreciate. My only critique is that on some occasions I have had to wait a very long time on the phone in the morning to get through to reception, but I appreciate this is very common for many practices and the morning is obviously their busiest time on the phones.\n\nOverall I’m absolutely chuffed with Riverlyn and whilst I hope to not need their services much again in the future, I feel in safe hands if I do.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-11-20T10:36:19","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-11-20T20:51:41","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/999418","id":"999418"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/999418/responses","id":"999418"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/999418/healthservices","id":"999418"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/999418/tags","id":"999418"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/c84717","id":"C84717","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/antibiotics","id":"antibiotics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/arm","id":"arm"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lump","id":"lump"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20impressed","id":"not impressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/safe","id":"safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hope","id":"Hope"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/impressed","id":"impressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doing%20well","id":"doing well"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/no%20hope","id":"no hope"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20safe","id":"very safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20great","id":"not great"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1000271","id":"1000271"}]},{"id":999420,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"well done SpaMedica","body":"I was dreading it but after months of putting up with loss of vision I saw my optician and within a short time I was seen and yesterday I had laser treatment.\nThe staff were lovely and I felt like I was being cared for by caring and compassionate staff.

As for the health care I can honestly say I don’t think we could ask for a better service then we experienced, the whole medical team involved left no stones unturned to find out what was wrong with our son and how to move forward with his care. Everyone came across very genuine and concerned for our boy and that was of great comfort to us. We can’t thank everyone working with or in the bluebell ward  for everything. Every member is a true credit to the Nhs and should be valued in the highest regard. \nThe only thing I would say is the room needs a bit of an update.

I was very unwell and had severe breathing difficulties. He dialled 999 and was speaking to an operator in Birmingham who told him a London ambulance was on the way. Within 10 minutes the ambulance were here. They were very professional and reassuring. They performed numerous tests, spoke to my GP and it was clear I was suffering from a chest infection for the past two weeks, and not a flu thst I believed I had. They obtained a prescription, via my GP, for antibiotics to be sent to my local chemist. They even offered to collect the meds for me if my chemist couldn't deliver. They ascertained we were aware of what we needed to do and be aware of and told my husband if my condition worsened to contact them straight away. Due to their speed and professionalism, three days later I am well on the road to recovery. We would never normally phone the emergency services for a minor problem but i am grateful that my husband did.\nWe did not expect or presume such a speedy response, especially when we know they are so poorly staffed but their response time and care was second to none and I truly feel I would not have survived the night, but for them. We wholeheartedly thank them for their dedication and service during this difficult time.

She cared for me with the utmost professionalism and I’m really thankful for the time she gave to me.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-11-18T23:13:05.3333333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-11-21T10:36:58.84","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":3}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/999038","id":"999038"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/999038/responses","id":"999038"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/999038/healthservices","id":"999038"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/999038/tags","id":"999038"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/nvh-day-surgery","id":"nvh-day-surgery","score":4},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/accommodating","id":"accommodating"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/caring","id":"caring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/day%20surgery","id":"day surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/operation","id":"operation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professional","id":"professional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professionalism","id":"professionalism"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/well%20organised","id":"well organised"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/calm","id":"calm"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thankful","id":"Thankful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20at%20ease","id":"put at ease"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/listened%20to","id":"listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/concerns%20answered","id":"concerns answered"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/clean","id":"clean"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/well%20explained","id":"well explained"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/999752","id":"999752"}]},{"id":999002,"author":"craterqy64","authorRoleId":2,"authorRole":"a friend","title":"Breast cancer care gartnavel general Glasgow","body":"I attended a meeting today as a support for my dear friend who has breast cancer.

I had to wait for a while for the doctor to see me but in that time members of staff checked on me and we were offered hot drinks. The doctor said I had not broken any bones and could go home with some painkillers. The nursing assistant insisted that I try to walk a few steps before leaving, she did this firmly and kindly. Despite the department being very busy, everyone was kind and caring, introducing themselves by name.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-11-21T10:06:29","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-11-21T13:11:16","readBy":[{"name":"Frimley Health NHS Foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/999547","id":"999547"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/999547/responses","id":"999547"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/999547/healthservices","id":"999547"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/999547/tags","id":"999547"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rdu","id":"RDU","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/broken","id":"broken"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/broken%20bones","id":"broken bones"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/in%20pain","id":"in pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/leg","id":"leg"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/painkillers","id":"painkillers"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/x%20ray","id":"x ray"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/x-ray","id":"X-ray"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/worse%20than%20before","id":"worse than before"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/comfortable","id":"comfortable"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1001433","id":"1001433"}]},{"id":999549,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Very positive ","body":"I rarely post reviews but I had my first visit to Long Hanborough Medical Centre today and my first experience of Eynsham Group Practice was very positive.

My husband, being proactive did exactly that. Our GP called to advise that she was sorry to tell him his PSA was 43, substantially elevated. She advised she would refer for further investigation and to urology for urgent review.  \r\nAn appointment came through later that week for a bone scan (mid October) and an appointment with the urology consultant the following day at a waiting list clinic. At this point, we were both feeling relieved that NHS Lanarkshire was all over this and thankfully my husband had been pro-active.  \r\nThe radiographer at University Hospital Monklands (UHM) on the day of the bone scan was superb. Upon hearing the appointment with the urology consultant was the following day, he went above and beyond to speak with the radiologist to have the scan reported and available for the following day.  \r\nWe then both attended University Hospital Hairmyres (UHH) the following day to see the urology consultant. His approach was very honest and he advised the prostate felt ‘abnormal’ and he would refer for MRI and TRUS (transrectal ultrasound scan) biopsy and get a further PSA.  \r\nMRI was confirmed for a few days later with TRUS biopsy arranged for the following Monday. You can see looking at this timeline why my pride in NHS Lanarkshire is not misplaced!  \r\nWhen we attended for TRUS biopsy, we were both floored to be advised by the Urology Nurse Specialist and Consultant that despite our beliefs that this diagnosis was caught early, there was advanced local spread with seminal vesicles as well as lymph node involvement and that the majority of the prostate appeared abnormal on MRI. Bone scan appeared negative for bone metastases. They were both fantastic in their approach and very supportive. The consultant that day advised he already had my husbands name on the Multi Disciplinary Team (MDT) discussion list for 1st November before performing the TRUS biopsy. We had an appointment confirmed with the Lead Urology Cancer Nurse Specialist the following day to discuss the outcome of MDT:  \r\nAll biopsy samples were positive for prostate cancer  \r\nGleason score was 4+5=9  \r\n70% of the total tissue sent to labs was involved  \r\nCurrent PSA was 50.1  \r\nAll of this places my husband in a high risk group  \r\nThe MDT had discussed our case at length, taken into consideration his age, lack of any co-morbidities, general fitness and decided they would take an equally aggressive multi-modality approach to treatment. Consultant would request a PSMA PET scan and if this was clear for bone metastases, the surgical team in Glasgow would consider a robotic radical prostatectomy. My husband was also referred to the Consultant Oncologist for consideration of best adjuvant approach with/without surgery. Again, the person centred and assertiveness of the MDT in throwing everything in their arsenal at this is to be totally commended.  \r\nThis has all been as diligent, proactive and (controlled) chaotic a time since GP appointment to now, as it reads.  \r\nHowever, now we are left…….waiting……agonisingly waiting…….  \r\nThe referral was made on 2nd November. We were advised the scanner only operates on Wednesdays but would not be operational on 9th initially. Advised on 11th that scanner will not be operational on 16th either due to lack of adequate patients on list. There is no commitment as to when the scanner will operate.  \r\nSurely it is within the gift of NHS Scotland and the Scottish Clinical Imaging Network to take a cohesive and collaborative approach and have one scanner running between the four sites in Scotland regularly enough that patients do not have this agonising and potentially catastrophic wait.  \r\nI note in the recent Scottish Clinical Imaging Network (SCIN) waiting list report the addendum that PSMA (Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen )scans are not included as they are booked in advance to differing waiting time standards. Is the standard fit for purpose and justifiable?  \r\nI find this to be an abomination as every patient on that list is precious and this goes against every value and the entire ethos of our NHS as an institution. I am sure there will be others in my husband’s position of this scan being crucial to planned recovery and positive outcomes or the unimaginable alternative.  \r\nThe Royal Marsden in London and Sutton offer this scan privately at great cost. Despite additional efforts this week of the consultant and nurse specialists involved to have this expedited, we all had to admit defeat on Friday and my husband’s current clinical record has been sent to The Royal Marsden.  \r\nWe would absolutely travel to an alternative NHS site in Scotland to have this scan if it was an option. If payment was required to do this, we would be more than willing to put this back into our NHS in Scotland.  \r\nI am concerned as we enter winter pressures, with strikes on the horizon and the ongoing effects of covid that pressures within our NHS will substantially risk further delay if we can’t get this treatment off the starter blocks as soon as possible. All other options are not on the table in the hope that surgery is. In the meantime, these cancer cells are left to proliferate unhindered by any active treatment.  \r\nMy concern is obviously first and foremost to achieve the best possible outcome for my cherished, young and otherwise healthy husband but he will not be the first or the last of our NHS patients and their loved ones to face this anguish and distress.  \r\nI therefore implore you to do anything you possibly can to support us in progressing with this equally critical and pivotal investigation. We are left here meantime waiting, petrified and facing an uncertain future.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-11-13T08:44:12.3933333","progress":"Story has a

ICU changed their rules about who could be given information about him and who could visit every day. Although I felt they consistently treated me with total disdain despite being his wife of 44 years. We were separated but cared deeply about one another.  \r\nI feel they chose to play God and define us by something that happened in that one week when he was barely conscious. I felt victimised by ICU staff, other people who barely knew my husband had no questions asked or judgements made about them. I found this appalling and all the more so that it was ICU. Apparently it was their compassion which allowed me to be there for his last moments prior to his ventilator being removed. IT was too late and too distressing. My husband died alone and that has had a massive impact on my life.  \r\nMy only value seems to have been to collect his death certificate and arrange his funeral. Two long standing friends rang to ask about my husband and no-one even had the courtesy to ask them for their names so he never knew they had expressed any concerns. They too felt they were treated as if they were an inconvenience. At the end of life when I was suddenly allowed in ICU they appeared to feel it was appropriate to regard my husband's brother as his next of kin, despite the fact he has Stage Three Bowel Cancer and had to travel over 400 miles to visit.  \r\nPresumably myself and my brother in law were needed to give approval for the removal of the ventilator. A horrible traumatic experience which no-one should ever have to face. ICU's care in this instance guaranteed my husband died alone as the week progressed.  \r\nPursuing a complaint has involved liaising with their Patient Experience Team. How hurtful to regard death as an experience. Their response to my complaint itemises my concerns and then ignores some of them. The response has taken two months and has not even been spell checked, and despite it allegedly coming from the Chief Executive no-one has even bothered to add a personal signature.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-11-18T22:47:43.22","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-11-21T13:53:08.213","readBy":[{"name":"Ulster University, MBBS (Medicine) 2021","count":1},{"name":"York and Scarborough Teaching Hospital NHS Foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/999037","id":"999037"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/999037/responses","id":"999037"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/999037/healthservices","id":"999037"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/999037/tags","id":"999037"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rcb55","id":"RCB55","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ignored","id":"ignored"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/a&e","id":"a&e"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/complaint","id":"Complaint"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/death","id":"death"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dying","id":"dying"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/end%20of%20life","id":"end of life"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hurt","id":"hurt"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/relatives","id":"relatives"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ventilator","id":"ventilator"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/victimised","id":"victimised"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/worthless","id":"worthless"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/icu","id":"icu"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20good%20enough","id":"not good enough"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/no%20information","id":"no information"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1000880","id":"1000880"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1021825","id":"1021825"}]},{"id":999579,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Iridium is the best practice I have ever been to ","body":"I love the fact that you can ring in the morning and get a same day appointment either face to face or telephone, it’s your choice.
