Was seen in A&E, medical and nursing staff were fantastic and the care was first class. All investigations I needed were done so quickly.  \r\nI was kept up to date with plans and treatment as was my family.  \r\nI was transferred to Admissions Unit One and the excellent care continued. I was made to feel welcome and those who were caring for me introduced themselves to me and they made me feel at ease. Nothing was any bother to them, even for the short time I was there.  \r\nI then went to Ward 51. The care I received was excellent. They made sure I knew what to expect and what was going to happen next. Again I was so pleased that my family was contacted and kept informed of my condition, treatment and what was to happen next.  \r\nOverall it was a first class experience.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-05-23T11:29:01.07","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-06-05T08:41:54.137","readBy":[{"name":"Fife Health & Social Care Partnership","count":2},{"name":"NHS Fife","count":8},{"name":"Sheffield University Medical School 2020","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/770070","id":"770070"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/770070/responses","id":"770070"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/770070/healthservices","id":"770070"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/770070/tags","id":"770070"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/f704h_180","id":"F704H_180","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/f704h-admissions-1","id":"F704H-admissions-1","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/fifehscp-gps","id":"fifehscp-gps","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/a&e","id":"a&e"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20clot","id":"blood clot"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ct","id":"ct"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gp","id":"GP"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medical%20care","id":"medical care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medical%20team","id":"Medical Team"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nursing%20care","id":"nursing care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20introduction","id":"staff introduction"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20pleased","id":"very pleased"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/welcome","id":"welcome"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/feel%20at%20ease","id":"feel at ease"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/early%20investigation","id":"early investigation"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/772398","id":"772398"}]},{"id":770916,"author":"AnnieF","authorRoleId":4,"authorRole":"a relative","title":"Concerns about stopping spread of covid-19","body":"Concerned that staff are not taking proper steps to stop spread of covid 19.

The water drinks machine is also positioned right next to one of the armchairs. This compromised social distancing for the patient in the chair and all those using the water machine.

Having to juggle this and having to return to uni (had to take a year out due to plans to hang myself) and move away again I haven't been able to get consistent care. When I returned home from the year out I tried to make contact with the CMHT in the area but I got given a cpn who just spoke about wellbeing exercises which wasn't useful for me, nothing else was offered.  \r\nNow that I'm back I was trying to get help because I didn't want to feel this way anymore. This has been since march. I understand the situation with covid but at the same time I also don't know why this is impacting help so much. The reason I'm writing this is I tried to OD yesterday, my parents who I live with walked in and I gave up the effort when they saw and phoned an ambulance, it would have been counter productive in my eyes to continue if 'help' was on the way.  \r\nI had already taken myself to a& e a month ago because of these feelings and it's only getting worse. I got picked up by the ambulance crew, thankfully they were very understanding and said they could see I needed help. They contacted the CMHT to see me but when I went there it all went downhill.  \r\nI don't know how long I was in a room with them, I felt they treated me like a child. I wouldn't agree to the plan of just taking more meds and just waiting, I'm past that point, I wasn't willing to give up my stash of meds because they have shown me countless times I don't matter with them and I'm done trying to fight. However since they couldn't get an agreement out of myself they went straight to my parents and said what they wanted me to agree to to them as if that was it. Then I was just sent away.  \r\nMy homelife isn't great and something that adds to the worsening of my condition. They never once asked if I feel safe there. When I got back this caused more arguments, I had to leave this home and go stay with a friend, away from my stash but not away from my thoughts and an OD isn't the only way I have planned in the past. I'm sick and tired of their lack of concern, the people that are supposed to help and it feels like they just haven't bothered. The ambulance staff said I needed help and needed away from there, and the people they took me to just turned me away because I wouldn't agree to a plan that should have been put in place 2 months ago because they haven't done enough for me.","criticality":"strongly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-06-03T07:17:38.3633333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-06-05T09:31:11.67","readBy":[{"name":"North Lanarkshire Health & Social Care Partnership","count":4},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":1},{"name":"North Lanarkshire Advocacy","count":1},{"name":"Partnership for Change","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/770929","id":"770929"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/770929/responses","id":"770929"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/770929/healthservices","id":"770929"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/770929/tags","id":"770929"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/coatbridge-cmht-outreach","id":"coatbridge-cmht-outreach","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/s37000021","id":"S37000021","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/patronised","id":"patronised"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/access%20to%20mental%20health%20services","id":"access to mental health services"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/concerned","id":"concerned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20illness","id":"mental illness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/paramedics","id":"paramedics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/771168","id":"771168"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/771916","id":"771916"}]},{"id":770923,"author":"Respect","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Flexible Sigmoidoscopy","body":"A lovely nurse explained everything to me before and after the procedure.  \r\nAlthough everyone was wearing PPE they were so attentive and caring, making an unpleasant experience bearable.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-06-02T19:13:50.51","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-06-05T09:32:21.55","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Tayside","count":5},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/770923","id":"770923"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/770923/responses","id":"770923"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/770923/healthservices","id":"770923"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/770923/tags","id":"770923"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/t202h_301","id":"T202H_301","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/attentive","id":"attentive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/caring","id":"caring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lovely","id":"lovely"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/respected","id":"respected"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/flexible%20sigmoidoscopy","id":"Flexible Sigmoidoscopy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/explanations","id":"explanations"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/771690","id":"771690"}]},{"id":771036,"author":"NHSpatient01","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"First seizure-access to neurology","body":"My father has his first seizure in January 2020.

I went to my Dr requesting pain relief and was started on codeine, but nothing seemed to help. I slowly worked my way up until prescribed fentanyl.  \r\nI again was put onto a higher dose until the pain finally became manageable. Unfortunately thats really where the problems began. I began taking more than prescribed, and everything around me began to fall apart, but I was blinded by the medication. How can something that has stopped me being in pain, affect my life negatively?  \r\nI stopped going to work, I couldn't get out of bed. I would fall asleep having a meal, I only showed the people around me affection when under the influence of the pain relief. So I stopped taking it, and subsequently experienced opiate withdrawal \"cold turkey\" for the first time.  \r\nI tried everything to come off the medication without help. I thought if I told my Dr what was going on, he would cut me off and I'd be left in withdrawal. No words can truly describe the excruciating discomfort of withdrawal. You count every second, of every minute, of every hour. If your lucky enough to fall asleep, you dream about it. Its hell.  \r\nUnfortunately I had no idea there was help available, and by the time I did, I lost my family, my partner, my friends. I honestly thought I was going to die from my addiction. Knowing this I finally told my Dr the truth. He put in touch with CGL, and that's when I found out there was help.  \r\nI went through the groups and process. I was given buprenorphine and I that was really the hardest part over. I slowly tapered down on the bupanorphine until I was at a stage to stop. I won't lie and say the 7 days after were easy, as I still experienced withdrawal. I would say day 5 was the toughest but I got through it.  \r\nThats where it ends. I'm back into work, off all forms of medication and slowly rebuilding the destruction my addiction caused. The only advice I would give anyone is just be honest. If you know you have a problem, don't suffer like I did. Get help.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-06-04T09:25:47.52","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2020-06-05T10:50:13.093","readBy":[{"name":"Change Grow Live","count":6},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2021)","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/771039","id":"771039"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/771039/responses","id":"771039"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/771039/healthservices","id":"771039"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/771039/tags","id":"771039"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/nms-west-kent-drug-alcohol-wellbeing","id":"nms-west-kent-drug-alcohol-wellbeing","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/addiction","id":"addiction"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/alone","id":"alone"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/desperate","id":"desperate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/empathy","id":"empathy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/help","id":"help"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/injury","id":"injury"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain%20relief","id":"pain relief"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/slipped%20disc","id":"slipped disc"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"}]},{"id":771170,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Amazing quick response","body":"I contacted pals on behalf of my son, who is in a upsetting situation.

We had just celebrated his 18 birthday and this illness came out of the blue. He was extremely fit and active prior to this. \nAfter experiencing unusual symptoms he was eventually diagnosed in Macclesfield as suffering from a spinal abscess and had lost some sensation below the waist on admission. They sought advice from specialists at Salford Royal who advised immediate transfer. From the minute we landed at Salford Royal both the staff and treatment were excellent. \nThis was an extremely challenging and stressful time for the family with a positive outcome far from guaranteed. The consultant surgeon met us soon after arrival. He was open, honest and explained everything. He offered no false guarantees, which was difficult to hear at the time but appreciated. They acted fast and arranged surgery within a few hours despite complications with blood clotting, a complication of the infection that had to be rectified prior to surgery. \nAfter surgery he was transferred to ward H5 where we found the staff friendly, supportive and helpful. When I left each evening I was reassured he was in safe hands. Communication was excellent throughout. I am so grateful to all from the medical staff and physios through to the domestics who kept his room spotless and staff who worked hard to keep him well fed during his recovery.\nWe felt well supported throughout, and following discharge we returned for a routine dressing change; one of the doctors sought us out to enquire about how my son was doing post discharge. \nThe aftercare has been amazing and we have received all follow up input as we were advised. \nMy son has recovered so well his functioning is almost back to normal after a few months, an outcome that could only be dreamed of at the point of admission. \nCan’t fault the care received in any way.

I arrived for a  blood test at 7.40 am, aware that it is a busy time but assuming it would be cleaner not having had patients there overnight. The department opens at 8, and there was a queue. I handed my papers and asked if I could wait in my car until 8 as I was shielding and was very afraid to be out. The receptionist agreed. At 8 I went back and explained I had been waiting outside. By now all the people who had been waiting before me had been replaced by another queue. I waited, and when two people who had come in after me were called I asked if I would have to wait much longer as by now I’d been a total of 40 minutes and was shielding, the reply was a terse “A lot of people are shielding, it won’t be long”. I explained again that I’d given her my form at 7.40 and had asked if it would be ok to wait outside and she replied that she hadn’t seen me. I appreciate people are busy, and it wasn’t a huge  wait, but I got home and broke down because I was so afraid. The receptionist wasn’t practicing social distancing, standing right next to people in the corridor collecting forms, she didn’t wear a mask or gloves and spoke very abruptly to an elderly gentleman who was taking a while to stand up to move along in the queue. I don’t know what has happened to the concern for mental health but I am left feeling incredibly vulnerable. I do not usually go to QE2 but I’d gone to Hertford the previous day and it was closed, and I couldn’t get a home visit in time and so I had no choice.

The Dr was honest in her responses without being harsh or too blunt, this approach, while upsetting was also reassuring.  \r\nThe nursing staff were attentive and caring and responded quickly to control any symptoms.  \r\nOverall the only similarity I can give was it was like being in your favourite restaurant - the staff were attentive, aware of the needs of all involved and increased their involvement when required but also kept in the background when they were not required.  \r\nThe only minor negative comment I would make is regarding a voluntary group who care and gave out a \"goody bag\" to the patients. The bag contained shower gel, shampoo and a comb (among other things). This was not entirely appropriate as most of the patients were confined to bed and a lot had been treated for cancer and they did not have a lot of hair. My mother saw the funny side of this but it could have been upsetting for some. My suggestion would therefore to ensure gifts being given out, even from voluntary groups at Christmas / Easter, should be checked to ensure they are appropriate.","criticality":"minimally critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-06-04T16:27:30.4733333","progress":"Change planned","dateOfPublication":"2020-06-05T12:51:25.927","readBy":[{"name":"Poole Hospital Palliative Care Service","count":6},{"name":"St. Andrews University ScotGEM Medical Students","count":1},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2020)","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/771090","id":"771090"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/771090/responses","id":"771090"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/771090/healthservices","id":"771090"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/771090/tags","id":"771090"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rd3-forest-holme-hospice","id":"RD3-forest-holme-hospice","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/attention","id":"attention"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cancer","id":"cancer"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20about","id":"Cared about"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/end%20of%20life","id":"end of life"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/honesty","id":"honesty"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hospice","id":"hospice"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/calm","id":"calm"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20for","id":"cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassion","id":"compassion"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fantastic","id":"fantastic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassuring","id":"reassuring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/relaxed","id":"relaxed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/family%20kept%20informed","id":"family kept informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appropriate%20supplies","id":"appropriate supplies"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/771230","id":"771230"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/771264","id":"771264"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/771996","id":"771996"}]},{"id":771211,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Great Practice","body":"I contacted the Surgery as was experiencing hip & back pain.

We have recently moved house and were aware that our new home was out of catchment, and would therefore need to change practices. This was not something either of us wanted to do but understood why it had to be done. Unfortunately due to the current pandemic, we were not able to change surgeries immediately. Luckily Kingswood allowed us to stay registered with themselves during this time. We wrote a letter to update our address and later the same day, received a call from the practice manager saying that it wouldn't be necessary for us to change doctors. \nNow this may only seem like a small thing to some people but for my husband and me, it is massive! Between the 2 of us, we have numerous life-long health conditions with 7 monthly repeat prescriptions. The thought of going through everything again with a new doctor was incredibly daunting. Being with the same surgery for such a long time meant that we not only had good relationships with the doctors and nurses, but the front desk staff too. We have always felt respected by the staff and been more than happy with the level of care we have received. Something that neither of us take for granted.\nAs I said before, this may only seem like a small and insignificant gesture to some people, but not for us. It is a huge weight that has been lifted and a worry we no longer have to deal with.\nThank you for not just seeing us a \"name and address\" on a piece of paper but rather as individuals. For this, we are extremely grateful.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-06-05T13:56:05","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2020-06-05T13:58:17","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/771222","id":"771222"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/771222/responses","id":"771222"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/771222/healthservices","id":"771222"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/771222/tags","id":"771222"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rcd55","id":"RCD55","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good","id":"good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/insignificant","id":"insignificant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/respected","id":"respected"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/weight","id":"weight"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happy","id":"happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"}]},{"id":771097,"author":"Mummy25","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Maternity services","body":"I received fantastic care for all the staff in dr greys through out my pregnancy.

I was told to keep the foetal tissue and send it off for testing. I did this at the end of February and was told the results would take 8 weeks. I eventually chased these in May and was told my results came back at the end of February but no-one had told me.  \r\nI finally had blood tests yesterday to check for clotting issues, lupus etc. I was told the majority of my results would be back today.

We have first hand seen a patient asking for information, and put down in a rather demeaning manor in front of other patients in the waiting area.

I was worried about coming in as it was the first time that I had left my local area since Lock-down began. I was immediately reassured by the gentle and pleasant greeting I received at the entrance door. I was offered hand gel and a mask to wear and directed to the MRI area. The receptionists sent me straight through and I was seen straight away. The waiting room had been rearranged to allow for social distancing and all staff wore masks so, again, I was reassured. As always, the Radiographers were kind, efficient and reassuring and I saw all equipment being sterilised as I was leaving.
