We were told that was the only way to make an appointment, so we sat in the reception and tried to book. The system is very confusing to navigate and yes we are tech savvy, so after a stand off with receptionist managed to make an appointment. Five months down the line we have tried in vain to make an appointment, only to be faced with same problem. You cannot ring the centre as nobody answers the phone.

She realised that she needed extra care and also that living on her own with failing health was causing her some anxiety. The layout and the gardens at Slieve Roe were a bonus for her as she loves nature and enjoys sitting outside.  \r\nThe Slieve Roe staff were very accommodating and helpful and having company was a big bonus for her mental health.

Sometimes I come in via A&E and others I am brought straight up to the ward. We are usually brought in via Ambulance - the multiple crews involved are all amazing - extremely helpful. I feel like we know all the crews in the area now and all I can say is they are all absolutely brilliant.  \r\nThe Emergency Department has been great some times, more so recently. This is because on a couple of occasions I felt that it was difficult to get my point across, with some staff seeming less experienced with complex needs. However, ever since the consultant intervened the Emergency Department experience has been much better - great and very positive.  \r\nMoving up onto the paediatric ward - we really love it up here. We really prefer the ward here at Daisy Hill Hospital over the Royal. If we can we choose here because of the first class equipment, staff, assistants, cleaners etc. It really makes the stay easier with such excellent staff, as they really do look after the parent as well which is very important.Every single nurse has been amazing - they really do everything they can for us - they are simply fantastic. The paediatric ward is absolutely great.  \r\nThe only two improvements I could think of would be if more specialists were available. I would also like there to be a vending machine with water in it in the Emergency Department - as there is often a long wait in the ED with there often being no chance of getting anything to eat or drink. This small change would make a big difference.  \r\nOverall, the paediatric ward, and the hospital in general, has been excellent and the staff involved in my daughter's care have been absolutely fantastic!","criticality":"minimally critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-09-14T13:23:01.78","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-09-15T13:13:54.663","readBy":[{"name":"Northern

On arriving at hospital I received further excellent care from the A&E Dr Debbie who explained everything really clearly offering reassurance the whole way. She was supported by Jenna and Micha the staff nurses who were both fantastic. From here everyone has been brilliant, radiographers, porters, physio’s, Dr’s, The Theatre team, and every single member of staff on ward 33, you were all so lovely, nothing was to much trouble, you showed kindness and compassion throughout despite knowing how busy I know you all are. Special thanks also to Taylor the student nurse on ward 33, you were fab.  \r\nMy care has been excellent, the only disappointing area of my experience was the wait for the ambulance, I say this not as a complaint but in support of the ambulance service for more resource. I was on a street for 3 hours in extreme pain, I know nobody wants that, it was traumatic and I urge anyone who doesn’t truly need an ambulance please do not call one to allow them to get to those most in need.  \r\nThank you all for your care, you were all fantastic.

I’ve just been having lots of tests recently and scans, it’s been a week on but unfortunately I’ve no diagnosis yet which is a little frustrating. It’s just more the fact if I knew what was wrong then I would be able to start the coping process. I do worry and I’m cautious whatever I have needs treatment which I can’t get yet until we know the cause.  \r\nThe staff are however lovely here and it’s a nice wee place. Only thing is I am sick of the same menu and it always being something with chicken or curry I have had them all and just actually want some plain food now. For lunch today I just took some chicken soup and potatoes and it was actually quite nice. The cleaning is very good here. They are so helpful and can’t do enough for you here. It is a busy ward but a good one all the same. Yes I do feel safe in terms of COVID well at least I hope so. I’ve been swabbed twice since being here and I know they swab everyone who comes through A&E so that settles me. I also have both my vaccines which gives me some comfort.  \r\nIt is always clear to me what the tests are they medical team are doing, I’m a nurse myself so If they’re doing a blood test I make sure to ask them what for and why. I do worry so I ask questions and they always explain well what they’re doing or looking for. Overall getting on good here and think the staff are perfect stars.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-09-14T13:41:19.6466667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-09-15T13:34:54.057","readBy":[{"name":"Southern Health and Social Care Trust","count":4}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/877577","id":"877577"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/877577/responses","id":"877577"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/877577/healthservices","id":"877577"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/877577/tags","id":"877577"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_32024_300","id":"ZT003_32024_300","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frustrated","id":"frustrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood","id":"blood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20test","id":"blood test"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/clean%20ward","id":"clean ward"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/clear","id":"clear"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diagnosis","id":"diagnosis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gi","id":"GI"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lovely","id":"lovely"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/test","id":"test"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/test%20results","id":"test results"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tests","id":"tests"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treated%20well","id":"treated well"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20for","id":"cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/food%20variety","id":"food variety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scans","id":"scans"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%20safety","id":"covid safety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/everything%20explained","id":"everything explained"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/880658","id":"880658"}]},{"id":877604,"author":"uniformne59","authorRoleId":7,"authorRole":"a staff member posting for a carer/relative","title":"Paediatric Ward has been absolutely fabulous","body":"We were sent to A&E by the GP when my son wasn't eating or drinking.

I was then taken to have a cannula inserted and some questions regarding my health. The doctor Mr. Wilson then came an explained what the risks were involved and I signed my consent form. I was then taken to the scope room and introduced to the 3 nurses that would look after me during the procedure. It was friendly and reassuring. I had sedation and before I knew it I was being taken to the ward to recover with a super cup of tea and toast. Dr. Wilson then explained about how I would go forward and wait 3-5 weeks for my biopsy results to come back.

They have always been exceptional. However, I have recently realised that the quality of their services cannot be compared to other places. That said, I left Aberdeen over two years ago, yet I continue to return to this specific clinic because of the staff, help, and the overall quality of care and treatment delivered. Whilst every visit to this clinic has been phenomenal, my last visit this September exceeded all my expectations and previous visits.  \r\nIt all began by arranging my appointment. I spoke to an incredibly lovely lady who even remembered me! I wouldn’t expect it but it felt absolutely incredible as it provided me with confidence and faith that I was yet again right to return to this clinic. I was offered appointments that would best suit me and my busy schedule and all was arranged within minutes.  \r\nOn the day of my visit, I was very politely welcomed and very well informed about the whole process. I showed up 20 minutes before my appointment and only waited 5 minutes before the nurse came and was already ready for me. The nurse - Rachel - was wonderful. I honestly loved her so much - she is the reason why this visit went above and beyond my expectations. There are two reasons for this. One, I have a friend who was stressed as he recently tested positive for an STI and didn’t receive the support he had hoped for where he lives. Rachel, without being even asked, offered to speak to my friend over the phone. Whilst the appointment was for me only, she didn’t mind and actually put his mind at ease. She provided him with all necessary details, and even provided the necessary emotional support! My friend couldn’t stop thanking me for doing this for him. Meanwhile, it wasn’t me - it was all Rachel. Later, I had a great chat with her and we did the full screen as always. She was very gentle, caring, and understanding as I am not the biggest fan of needles. Before I left, she even gave me a leaflet for my friend to read through and sent me a text message with a link about STIs which I was able to direct to my friend. Incredibly helpful! She highly deserves to be recognised for her work and care for patients. I hope this review will reach her! She is a prime example of an exceptional nurse.  \r\nThank you for your services, I know I will continue to return. However, my biggest thanks go to Rachel for being incredible towards not only me and my friend over the phone, but also for being an incredible nurse.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-09-14T18:05:47.6166667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-09-15T13:48:32.633","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Grampian","count":2},{"name":"Aberdeen City Health & Social Care Partnership","count":2},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2022)","count":1},{"name":"Sheffield University Medical School 2021","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/877617","id":"877617"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/877617/responses","id":"877617"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/877617/healthservices","id":"877617"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/877617/tags","id":"877617"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sn9-community-village-sh","id":"SN9-community-village-sh","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/above%20and%20beyond","id":"above and beyond"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/caring","id":"caring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/exceptional","id":"exceptional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/faith","id":"faith"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gentle","id":"gentle"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/incredible","id":"Incredible"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lovely","id":"lovely"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/polite","id":"polite"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/quality","id":"quality"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sexual%20health","id":"sexual health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sti","id":"sti"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confidence","id":"confidence"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sexual%20health%20nurse","id":"sexual health nurse"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/everything%20explained","id":"everything explained"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/879192","id":"879192"}]},{"id":877597,"author":"coordinationff83","authorRoleId":7,"authorRole":"a staff member posting for a carer/relative","title":"Paediatric Ward has been brilliant","body":"We came to Daisy Hill Hospital due to my child suffering from bronchiolitis.

He had a psychotic break and spent weeks in PICU and in Lime Ward in Omagh, in the Tyrone and Fermanagh Hospital. He was put onto high doses of anti-psychotic medication and allowed home where he fell under the care of the community team at SWAH. From his first appointment, he was introduced to Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) and started improving. He found it really beneficial - as did our whole family. It reduced anxiety and helped him gain control and perspective when his thoughts began running away with him. His nurse was excellent and we really couldn't have asked for a more professional and more compassionate health care professional. Immediately I felt my son was listened to and I felt that his health care professional was concerned wtih what my son was concerned about i.e. anxiety and reducing medication. EMDR was a really useful tool and it meant a focus on the future and well-being as opposed to raking over the past. In my son's case this was really helpful.  \r\nHe is now completely off medication, going from 4mg of risperadone in April / May. He reduced slowly with the help of EMDR and is now drug free. He has returned to College in England and is feeling great.  \r\nI think that EMDR was really beneficial in his case and I am so happy with the care he got. We never expected him to recover so quickly. It is unbelievable how well he is considering how ill he was just a few short months ago. He is confident going forward, using EMDR whenever he starts to feel anxiety.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-09-14T13:51:13.1133333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-09-15T13:57:47.8","readBy":[{"name":"Western Health and Social Care Trust","count":10},{"name":"Public Health Agency","count":1},{"name":"BPP University, School of Nursing","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/877582","id":"877582"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/877582/responses","id":"877582"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/877582/healthservices","id":"877582"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/877582/tags","id":"877582"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt005_48029-lime","id":"ZT005_48029-lime","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt005-swah-amh","id":"zt005-swah-amh","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/drug","id":"drug"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emdr","id":"emdr"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/excellent","id":"excellent"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helpful","id":"helpful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurse","id":"nurse"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/psychotic","id":"psychotic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/shared%20care","id":"shared care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20listened","id":"Staff listened"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20for","id":"cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassionate","id":"compassionate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fast%20appointments","id":"Fast appointments"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/better%20hopefully","id":"better hopefully"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/listened%20to","id":"listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/beneficial","id":"beneficial"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/877818","id":"877818"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/878193","id":"878193"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/878264","id":"878264"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/878590","id":"878590"}]},{"id":877660,"author":"septemberec43","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Outstanding care in the emergency department","body":"I had an unfortunate bike accident resulting in a dislocated shoulder.

I knew then it was a girl as my oldest I had bp issues in the last month and with my son I had no bp issues.  \r\nI spent 2 days in Dorchester after my routine growth scan in August 2021. We were due October. I was given 2 steroid injections to help baby lungs if we didn’t make it to 34-37 weeks as they planned. I then spent 2 weeks in Southampton hospital with high bp and preeclampsia.  \r\nThe day before birth there was talk of having baby as my kidney levels weren’t what they should be and were getting worse. They’d done a last lot of bloods and kidneys were now stable so didn’t need to have baby. 11pm that night bp high again and medication wasn’t controlling it. The decision was made that rather then keep going round in circles we would have baby now. By this time it’s 1am and I’m waking up my husband that he has to come back as we are having baby. We live 1.5 hours away. He got there just in time.  \r\nThey took photos of her for us before taking her to nicu. My husband got to go see her first and then I got wheeled down. She was in nursery 4 first in an incubator and put on oxygen but within 24 hours she no longer needed assistance with this. She also had a feeding tube. She then got moved to nursery 1 as it was just her feeding we needed to work on.  \r\nUnfortunately she couldn’t tolerate anything. Formula or my milk. She was nil by mouth, had an X-ray but they couldn’t find a reason for it. She then had to have a long line put in to get things into her. She had to go on the sun bed twice for jaundice. She got moved to nursery 2 because of this but soon got moved back to nursery 1.  \r\nSouthampton then decided she didn’t need to be with them anymore but she couldn’t go to our local hospital as they don’t accept babies with long lines. At day 17 she was transferred here to Musgrove Park. She had her longline in and was having feeds through her tube 13ml every 2 hours. In her week here her milk has increased to 40ml every 3 hours. Her longline was removed as well as her feeding tube. She was taken out the incubator and put in cot. She has come on leaps and bounds.  \r\nThe staff are amazing and put you at ease asking anything. They will explain anything you don’t know. Phoning up whenever I needed to make sure she was ok. Nothing was too much bother. Even though not a first time mum they still told me things I hadn’t realised and didn’t make me feel daft. Our week here has been amazing watching her progress with feeds and weight gain.  \r\nHaving 2 older ones at home it has been really difficult being away. If I was with baby I felt guilty not being with them and when I was with them I felt guilty not being with baby. Also made it harder with COVID rules as I could only have my husband visit me when he could. I couldn’t leave the ward and meet visitors downstairs because of my bp. My now middle child cried when he saw me and wouldn’t let me go. That was tough seeing how much it had been affecting him. FaceTime just wasn’t cutting it anymore. Being 5 he also couldn’t understand how he could be so close to his little sister but he couldn’t touch her. The first week there were tears. I’d had my first c-section and had no idea how the pain was going to be. I was frustrated with my bp which wasn’t helping it. It was just a lot to process things not being how they had been for my other 2 children.  \r\nWe couldn’t have got through all this without the support of family friends and also the hospital staff. It can be very lonely being here alone but talking to everyone helps relieve the pressure. It’s not easy going through this but we do get through it.  \r\nDay 24 and we get to take our little girl home. Surprise to the older 2 though as didn’t want to get their hopes up. Anything can happen.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-09-14T11:57:36.38","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-09-15T15:09:01.837","readBy":[{"name":"Somerset NHS Foundation Trust","count":6},{"name":"Plymouth University Health and Human Sciences students, 2018","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/877562","id":"877562"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/877562/responses","id":"877562"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/877562/healthservices","id":"877562"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/877562/tags","id":"877562"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rh5a8-422","id":"RH5A8-422","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rhm12_501","id":"RHM12_501","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20pressure","id":"blood pressure"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emotional%20support","id":"emotional support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/jaundice","id":"jaundice"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nil%20by%20mouth","id":"nil by mouth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/steroids","id":"steroids"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/contactable","id":"contactable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/explanations","id":"explanations"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/long%20line%20feeding","id":"long line feeding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/caesarean%20section","id":"caesarean section"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/877804","id":"877804"}]},{"id":877724,"author":"Sal sal","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Removal of a coil","body":"I have been having issues with my self down below.. had an ultrasound at the hospital in August to which was told my coil had moved and I needed it out.. the doctors still couldn’t accommodate me until the middle of October to which I told the receptionist I was disappointed as I was in pain!

After my GP spoke to microbiology it was decided that I should attend A&E to be entered into the system. Communication between my GP and I was first class and I felt listened to and involved in decisions surrounding my care which meant that I felt much happier to attend the emergency department.  \r\nWhen I arrived at A&E I was triaged quite quickly. The medical and nursing team knew what they needed to do to treat me but there were no beds on any ward for me in access. I was put on a trolley and into a side room where staff still did their best to communicate with me and treat me as best they could but I didn't feel this location or trolley was suitable to meet my needs. As a disabled person, I need use of an electric wheel chair to get around, after being put onto the trolley I needed to wait 24 hours before a bed was going to become available. Although I addressed this to the staff and they were so apologetic, they couldn't do anything more for me. In my opinion the emergency department is under resourced in every element and even through I was being treated I felt so uncomfortable and a loss of dignity. I know none of this was a fault of any of the staff are they were all doing an outstanding job and I cannot fault any element of their care, its just a lacking in facilities which is feel is becoming the 'norm' within the NHS.  \r\nEventually after 24 hours in the trolley I was moved to AMU. During the long 24 hour wait, as no beds were available on any wards, I almost felt guilty to be holding a bed in A&E when so many other patients in the waiting room didn't even have a chance to be seen. This being on my conscience really didn't help during the wait.  \r\nIn the AMU the staff have been brilliant, all my questions so far have been answered and I feel much more comfortable in my surroundings. I am so much happier with my ward space and know that I am becoming more clinically well everyday. I really enjoy the time I get to spend with the medical team during their rounds as I feel all my questions are answered and I am kept up to date with regards my care.  \r\nOverall the only improvements I could suggest would be the bed situation in A&E, something seriously has to be done! None of the staff I encountered can be faulted and I am grateful for their care, skills and professionalism.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-09-14T14:08:50.4466667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-09-15T15:51:17.76","readBy":[{"name":"Southern Health and Social Care Trust","count":7}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/877587","id":"877587"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/877587/responses","id":"877587"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/877587/healthservices","id":"877587"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/877587/tags","id":"877587"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_32024_180","id":"ZT003_32024_180","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_32024_300","id":"ZT003_32024_300","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/a&e","id":"a&e"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/answering%20questions","id":"answering questions"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency","id":"emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/environment","id":"environment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kept%20informed","id":"kept informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/more%20beds","id":"More beds"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professionalism","id":"professionalism"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/skilled%20staff","id":"skilled staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sputum","id":"sputum"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/triage","id":"triage"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dignity","id":"Dignity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happy","id":"happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/involved%20in%20decisions","id":"involved in decisions"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/comfortable","id":"comfortable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/listened%20to","id":"listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/more%20resources","id":"more resources"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/acute%20medical%20care","id":"acute medical care"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/877843","id":"877843"}]},{"id":877615,"author":"grushk49","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Rheumatology appointment 14/9/2021.","body":"This was my first visit to Hinchingbrooke rheumatology clinic.

This was 6 weeks ago and I’ve not received a referral and no one has been in touch. Luckily, my health insurance was happy to proceed without the referral in the end. Others may not be so lucky. \nI have a high risk pregnancy. I needed an urgent appointment for medication. The receptionist not only did not ask questions to see what the issue was and how they could help, they were rude and unhelpful and completely lacked empathy. Would not try to find a way to accommodate or find help for me. Apparently “this surgery is not an emergency service”. And I had to try again through the app the following morning. In the end, I called my old surgery who are absolutely amazing. First of all I was asked how I could be helped - an already warmer and friendlier approach. This receptionist’s response once I explained was “how soon can you get here”. A huge difference. Seems Queens Rd Surgery really needs to hire receptionists that exercise more empathy and ability to listen and actually want to try and help. I’m also shocked there don’t seem to be appointments available for emergencies? What if I was calling about a sick baby? I was told to go to A&E for emergencies or call 111. Thought the GP was supposed to provide some relief to the hospital and A&E system. \n\nI would not recommend using this surgery.

From the ambulance I was trolleyed straight into their operating room and immediately given an angiogram and the a stent was implanted to open a blocked coronary artery. That took about 30 minutes I reckon though I was sedated throughout. I felt immediately much better. On the ward I was given a battery of tests which covered not only the immediate heart problem but other problems. After 48 hours I was discharged with a carrier bag of new meds and ongoing monitoring.\nI cannot speak too highly of the care I received both the clinical and post op care were amazing.
