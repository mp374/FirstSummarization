I'm apparently not allowed to name the fab lady who recommended that I contact the Out of Hours surgery or GP Hub as it is also sometimes known as I wasn't aware of this service. \n\nThe OOO surgery were very busy as I tried to get through quite a few times but I persevered and managed to get through at 17:00 and spoke to a very professional agent who advised that a doctor would call me back within an hour and I was called back within 5 mins. \n\nThe doctor on call listened to the details of my condition, checked which was the nearest pharmacy to me, recommended what I needed and said that the treatment I required would be ready for me to pick up immediately from one of the pharmacists I prefer to use.  I am therefore extremely suitably impressed with this service and so I would say to all those patients who constantly moan and whine about how they can't get an appointment or a consultation, to please spare a thought for the amazing receptionists who, quite frankly, have to put up with an awful lot in terms of abuse and impatience as we are totally stuffed if they get sick!! \n\nWe are lucky to have such a good practice in E18 when the NHS is totally crumbling around us and shows no signs of any assistance from the Government as regards alleviating the constant pressure it is under as an organisation.  Please treat our remarkable receptionists with respect as they are the gateway to us getting better! Thank you ladies!

At this time their IQ was reassessed and with a score of 79-87 they were deemed as no longer requiring additional support from learning support services within the Southern Trust. They would have needed a score of 70 or below to allow them to continue accessing services - a very small margin in points has made a world of a difference. When I request support I am told that Trusts do not received funding for people on the Autistic Spectrum who are over 30. Just because someone is 30 years of age does not mean the condition and difficulties they having been living with all their life suddenly disappear.  \r\nThey are now 30 years of age and only able to access 4 hours voluntary work per week due to lack of a social worker. This has had a negative impact on their physical and mental well-being. A social worker would be able to refer him to additional services and enable us to apply for Self-Directed Support Payments. This would allow us to access additional hours at the community organisation where they currently work voluntarily for 4 hours per week, as well as other services within the community. They love the work and come alive when there.  \r\nThey have not been reassessed in the past 11 years - I've been told there would be no point as there likely wouldn't be a change. No one has listened to me, his mother, when I have said I see them deteriorating. They would not be able to live independently and my constant worry is what happens when I am no longer here . This worry has weighed me down to the point where I now feel physically, mentally and emotionally drained. I am requesting a reassessment of IQ through this site as my requests are falling on deaf ears in community services.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-11-22T16:34:35.98","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-11-25T09:59:22.45","readBy":[{"name":"Southern Health and Social Care Trust","count":6},{"name":"St. Andrews University ScotGEM Medical Students","count":1},{"name":"Ulster University, MBBS (Medicine) 2021","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/897448","id":"897448"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/897448/responses","id":"897448"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/897448/healthservices","id":"897448"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/897448/tags","id":"897448"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/st003-social-work-service","id":"st003-social-work-service","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20being%20listened%20to","id":"not being listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/worried","id":"worried"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/autistic","id":"autistic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/learning%20disability","id":"learning disability"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/social%20work","id":"social work"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/restricted","id":"restricted"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emotionally%20drained","id":"emotionally drained"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/900774","id":"900774"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/902553","id":"902553"}]},{"id":898289,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Very poor","body":"Unfortunately I do not like to leave poor reviews, especially after being a patient at this practice all my life, but now I worry about my children's care using this facility.

The staff and nurses are lovely and I really don't want this to be a reflection on them as I know its a relentless task for them at the minute.  However, the powers that be need to take a serious look at their current systems and the reason so many are now attending A&E. 534 phone calls last week and still no appointment!! When you do get an appointment if you are lucky its a telephone call, then if they need to see you that's another appointment. So what use to be one face to face appointment is now 2 appointments. So no wonder they cannot fit anyone in.  Why are you not back to face to face when the rest of the country is? I do hope things improve but it is a worry.

user","title":"Holistic and humane approach","body":"I had an unusual and heart warming experience of NHS services as someone who is often judged through the lens of a mental health diagnosis given to me by psychiatry which often results in professionals within NHS regardless of discipline making assumptions on my character.  \r\nThis was from a physiotherapist within the pain management clinic who treated me with respect and dignity that allowed me to see my strengths and abilities to manage my chronic pain condition. The physiotherapist treated me with a holistic approach, taking into consideration all areas of my life. She showed compassion and empathy for the difficulties I experience at the same time as encouraging me to use my own knowledge and determination to manage my lifestyle to in a way that means I can live my life to my fullest potential despite the pain condition I have.  \r\nAcceptance of a chronic pain condition can be a difficult journey but through the positive reinforcement of my own resilience and coping strategies by this physiotherapist, it has enable me to take control and personal responsibility for believing in my own abilities to manage this. This is the most empowering approach I believe any professional can offer as this strength based ethos has allowed me to maintain my autonomy and agency for my own wellbeing. I must make it clear that this approach also involved much support and education related to my condition and I feel the physiotherapist worked alongside me in this process.  \r\nI did not have much input in terms of hours/sessions however, this was very appreciated by me as the honesty and authenticity of the physiotherapist about my condition meant for me, that I could move forward and build on the strategies I already possess.  \r\nI would like to thank the physiotherapist, C, for your input and consistent respect and validation of my experience. To be seen as a whole person where your approach was not being overshadowed with my mental health diagnosis was invaluable to me. Your patience, as I struggled with accepting my condition and exploration through our conversations is commendable to you. I hope others have the opportunity to benefit from your approach as I have.  \r\nTo be treated in a holistic way is vital for anyone I think that receives treatment of any kind and I hope other professionals are able to learn from your approach to anyone receiving treatment in any health setting.  \r\nThank you so much for your approach, respect, authenticity and understanding. I will take this forward in my own management of my pain condition.  \r\n[Very happy with 'Seeing the whole me']  \r\n","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-11-22T22:03:23.2433333","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2021-11-25T10:33:18.88","readBy":[{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2022)","count":2},{"name":"NHS Forth Valley","count":2},{"name":"Scottish Recovery Network","count":1},{"name":"Scottish Government","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/897584","id":"897584"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/897584/responses","id":"897584"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/897584/healthservices","id":"897584"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/897584/tags","id":"897584"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/falkirk-ch-pain","id":"falkirk-ch-pain","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/chronic%20pain","id":"chronic pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diagnosis","id":"diagnosis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/heard","id":"heard"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/holistic","id":"holistic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/human","id":"human"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain%20management","id":"pain management"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/physiotherapist","id":"physiotherapist"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/respectful","id":"respectful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/understanding","id":"understanding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/understood","id":"understood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appreciated","id":"appreciated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassion","id":"compassion"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dignity","id":"Dignity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/empowered","id":"empowered"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/patience","id":"patience"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/valued","id":"valued"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/authentic","id":"authentic"}]},{"id":897751,"author":"CotfieldF","authorRoleId":3,"authorRole":"a parent/guardian","title":"Eye clinic appointment","body":"Disappointed with my poor patient experience this morning at the BGH Eye clinic.

I have two nurses who in particular I want to thank with all my heart. First nurse, Ross, who was in charge of night shift on the ward. I was so nervous about my 12 hour surgery the next day. He made time for me to listen and some of the pre-op preparation which wasn't pleasant was done by him but he really put me at ease so I didn't worry as much. A top nurse who the NHS is lucky to have. Secondly nurse assistant, Ryan. I've met Ryan before after my op in April. When I was told in the morning of my op that it wasn't going ahead due to no ICU beds I was so upset. Ryan was so caring and he was like having a member of my family being with me while I got the tears out. The built up to the operation only to be told it wasn't going ahead was one of the worst days of my life as operation was on my bowel cancer. This experience was horrible, Ryan just sat and listened and showed the most wonderful compassion. Another of Ninewells gems who I hope to meet again at my next scheduled operation.  \r\nAll the nurses are wonderful and hate picking out two but it's worth they get praise along with the ward senior nurse on ward 26 ....sorry didn't take their name which I feel bad about.","criticality":"minimally critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-11-23T17:11:20.4266667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-11-25T11:49:48.59","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Tayside","count":22}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/897817","id":"897817"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/897817/responses","id":"897817"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/897817/healthservices","id":"897817"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/897817/tags","id":"897817"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/t101h_370","id":"T101H_370","score":0},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bowel","id":"bowel"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bowel%20cancer","id":"bowel cancer"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cancer","id":"cancer"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/operation","id":"operation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20for","id":"cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassion","id":"compassion"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wonderful","id":"wonderful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20at%20ease","id":"put at ease"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/904865","id":"904865"}]},{"id":897827,"author":"hydrusxz66","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"first class treatment and monitoring","body":"An ultra sound scan for something unrelated showed a thickening on the back of the bladder wall. I was referred to and seen very quickly at the urology department of North Devon District Hospital.  \r\nI had no symptoms of bladder cancer and so consider myself very fortunate that the bladder cancer was discovered and diagnosed at an early stage.  \r\nA tumour was removed via a cystoscopy carried out under general anaesthetic followed by six weeks of chemotherapy. A further cystoscopy showed the cancer had become higher grade and more aggressive. Since then I have had a six week induction course of BCG immunotherapy treatment, after which there was no sign of recurrence, followed by a three week maintenance course of BCG treatment. I'm now awaiting a further cystoscopy before a second three week maintenance course of BCG treatment.  \r\nThroughout this situation I cannot fault the service I've received from every member of staff at the hospital. They have kept me fully informed at every stage, and my clinical nurse specialist has always been available to answer any queries or concerns I have.  \r\nIt's a great benefit that North Devon District Hospital has the facilities to treat cancer patients such as myself.The hospital is less than a half an hour drive from home, parking is easy, and I'm usually back home in just over an hour after leaving for the weekly treatments. Keeping it local takes a lot of stress out of the whole procedure, and doesn't impact too greatly on treatment days.  \r\nI am very appreciative of the team at the hospital, and have every confidence that I will receive first class treatment and monitoring in the future.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-11-23T17:31:40.4033333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-11-25T11:58:20.1","readBy":[{"name":"Royal Devon University Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust","count":19}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/897827","id":"897827"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/897827/responses","id":"897827"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/897827/healthservices","id":"897827"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/897827/tags","id":"897827"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rbz12_101","id":"RBZ12_101","score":5},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rbz12-oncology","id":"rbz12-oncology","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rbz95-poa","id":"rbz95-poa","score":5},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rbz-community-bbc","id":"RBZ-community-bbc","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/accessible","id":"accessible"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anaesthetic","id":"Anaesthetic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bladder%20cancer","id":"bladder cancer"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cancer","id":"cancer"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/chemotherapy","id":"chemotherapy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/clinical%20nurse%20specialist","id":"clinical nurse specialist"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cystoscopy","id":"cystoscopy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diagnosis","id":"diagnosis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fit","id":"fit"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fortunate","id":"fortunate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/healthy","id":"healthy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/induction","id":"induction"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/information","id":"information"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/parking","id":"parking"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/prompt%20care","id":"prompt care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scan","id":"scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tumour","id":"Tumour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ultrasound%20scan","id":"Ultrasound scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/urology","id":"urology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confident","id":"confident"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/energetic","id":"energetic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/faultless%20service","id":"faultless service"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/immunotherapy","id":"immunotherapy"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/898555","id":"898555"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/898665","id":"898665"}]},{"id":898309,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Awful ","body":"Everytime I've been to triage I've been treated badly.

Whilst I am realistic in my understanding that not everyone will see eye to eye, I have never seen behaviour like this on the shop floor. Angry outbursts, whispering behind backs and on two separate occasions the use of foul language. I was yelled at by a nurse (in front of doctors ) because I tried to help a fellow patient in need and was informed they were very busy. I was ignored on more than one occasion and felt ridiculed by a night nurse because I was unable to pass urine and was begging to be re-catheterised.  \r\nThe housekeeping staff were fantastic and truly cared. They were a welcome sight each day and were only too willing to help in any way they could.  \r\nWhilst I understand that staff are over worked etc etc I think patients deserve better. Compassion would be nice, patience would be lovely. Instead of the 'coiled springs' supposedly caring for us.  \r\nDon't get me wrong not every member of the nursing team falls under this umbrella. Some were lovely but unfortunately they were few and far between at times.  \r\nWhen you're in hospital you're ill. You're vulnerable and at times frightened. Many weeks with no contact with loved ones thanks to covid. I discovered when I got home that loved ones had rung most days to ask about me. Not once was I told that anyone had called. Trust me, patients deserve to know that loved ones are taking the time to call. It's all they have in this current climate. I feel that some members of staff need reminding that they are in a caring profession.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-11-23T18:22:10.36","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-11-25T12:13:03.373","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Ayrshire & Arran","count":19},{"name":"Office of Colin Smyth, MSP for South Scotland","count":1},{"name":"Plymouth University, BSc Nursing (Adult) 2021","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/897838","id":"897838"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/897838/responses","id":"897838"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/897838/healthservices","id":"897838"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/897838/tags","id":"897838"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/a210h-cau","id":"a210h-cau","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/domestic%20staff","id":"domestic staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/some%20staff","id":"some staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20behaviour","id":"staff behaviour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vulnerable","id":"vulnerable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassion","id":"compassion"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/poor%20communications","id":"poor communications"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/conflict","id":"conflict"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/898533","id":"898533"}]},{"id":897843,"author":"Cm41","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Fantastic care","body":"Fantastic care from nurse Iona, her nursing and people skills are exemplary.

After 24 hours I was ready to go to the Labour ward, but it took a couple of days to get there due to emergencies and the volume of labours/births. Once I was on the Labour ward, my waters were broken and I was started on a hormone drip.  \r\nFor the first few hours I coped well with this, but then it all became a bit too much. The midwife (Rebecca) was very supportive for both me and my partner. She recommended various pain relief options. I was being sick and just felt like I couldn’t cope at all with the pain. Again, Rebecca continued to offer support and was respectful of my wishes.  \r\nI initially coped well, but after a few hours I was emotionally drained and distressed by everything, then baby wasn’t coping well. I can’t remember who came in the room but there were a few people. I remember Melanie the Anaesthetist and the Consultant who were both lovely. After 8 hours I was still the same 1cm dilated I’d been 3 days previously. I was in pain and baby was distressed.  \r\nAn emergency section was recommended due to baby’s distress, which was either to be done by general anaesthetic or I think it was epidural. They explained the risks, gained consent and then I was in an operating room.  \r\nI found the whole experience terrifying, but the staff all did an amazing job at reassuring me and updated my partner until he could join me. Even during the epidural (I’m terrified of needles) they kept me informed and relaxed. I don’t remember a lot from that night because I had myself so emotionally distressed, but my baby arrived safely and I just want to thank everyone who played a part in looking after me and my baby that night. They might not be here today if it wasn’t for their quick reaction and compassion in supporting me and my partner during a difficult time.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-11-24T06:41:25.97","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-11-25T13:49:04.707","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":4},{"name":"Office of John Mason, MSP for Glasgow Shettleston","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/898015","id":"898015"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/898015/responses","id":"898015"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/898015/healthservices","id":"898015"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/898015/tags","id":"898015"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/g108h_501","id":"G108H_501","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anaesthetic","id":"Anaesthetic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anaesthetist","id":"anaesthetist"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/consultant","id":"consultant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/c-section","id":"c-section"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency","id":"emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/epidural","id":"epidural"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hormone","id":"hormone"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/labour","id":"labour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/midwives","id":"midwives"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain%20relief","id":"pain relief"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/quick%20response","id":"quick response"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/respectful","id":"respectful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supportive","id":"supportive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassion","id":"compassion"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassuring","id":"reassuring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/relaxed","id":"relaxed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20supportive","id":"very supportive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/well%20explained","id":"well explained"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing%20job","id":"amazing job"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/898370","id":"898370"}]},{"id":897919,"author":"Fricy","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Antenatal Care appointment was not acceptable","body":"I am currently pregnant with my 3rd child.  \r\nI am high risk pregnancy due to existing blood conditions and during my first pregnancy in 2012 I developed HELLP syndrome which resulted in baby being born by emergency c-section at 32 weeks. During my second pregnancy things were much smoother and baby was born at 38 weeks by planned section due to my platelet count reducing.  \r\nOn finding out that I was pregnant again at around 3 weeks I phoned antenatal and requested I be referred to the same doctor my previous pregnancies, however I was told that this was not possible as systems had changed and I would have to complete an online form. Having not heard back from anyone after 2 weeks I followed this up and was told that no one would be in contact until approx 12 weeks gestation. I advised that this was not an option as I would require blood thinning medication prior to 6 - 8 weeks to lessen chance of miscarriage. I was advised they would put a flag on the system and a midwife would be in touch for booking appointment when possible. Another week or 2 passed and I still had not heard from anyone regarding medication and therefore had to contact haematology to get access to the medication I require.  \r\nThis is the first pregnancy where I have been tested for Gestational Diabetes, which unfortunately was confirmed as positive at 28 weeks. On receiving diagnosis I was sent a link for a dietician video regarding dietary adjustments and given an appointment to attend to get testing kit and further information. This appointment (Thursday) advised of the risks of GD and why it happens during pregnancy. It was reassuring to know that there was nothing that I had done that had caused this and that it was due to hormonal changes during pregnancy. On being given the testing kit I was advised to monitor my blood sugars 4x a day (first thing in the morning and 2 hours after meals) I was also given parameters that my levels should be under. I would then have an appointment with the diabetic team on the Tuesday to review.  \r\nThe appointment I attended on that Tuesday is possibly the worst hospital appointment I have ever attended in my life. On going into the room there was a medical student, antenatal consultant and another doctor, the dietician then also joined us. The dietician and doctor we intimidating and condescending towards me regarding my dietary choices - bearing in mind I had not been asked to make any major changes at this stage. I was chastised for not watching the full video I had been sent the link to - although parts of the video are helpful that alone does not prepare you for the changes to be made due to GD - I highly recommend GDUK for information on dietary changes. I understand that watching the video is expected and required but as a working mother of 2 with a hectic schedule I just hadn't had time in the 4 days. However the dietician made me feel like I was to blame for the situation which is not helpful for any pregnant woman.  \r\nThe doctor also had not read my medical notes and made no effort to check these at all, presuming this was my first pregnancy, asking me to list all of my medical conditions and then asking me questions regarding the medications I was prescribed and how the doseage is not what they would recommend - I explained that it is the same dose as I was on in both previous pregnancies and they continued on to say that haematology must not be aware of the new guidance etc - all this information is in my notes, which were right in front of them. This attitude towards me was awful from start to finish and the consultant actually looked apologetic and pointed out that the information was all in the notes in front of them.  \r\nI have since contacted antenatal and requested my care be returned to my previous doctor as my consultant, this in itself was a difficult thing to do having phoned antenatal/midwives twice and never had a call back to confirm if this would happen and resulting in my having to email the antenatal consultants secretary to discuss directly with the previous doctor.  \r\nOn returning to diabetic clinic for my follow up appointment 4 weeks later I was seen by a midwife in the first instance and she could not have been more understanding of my situation which was so appreciated by me and my husband. There was a different consultant there today - However the midwife did offer to ask for my previous doctor to come to see me if that would be more comfortable for me. After some discussion I decided I would be OK with the new doctor so long as it was not the doctor I had seen the previous month, and this appointment went well.  \r\nI understand that the NHS is under an enormous amount of pressure and everyone can have a bad day but the way I was spoken to, judged and treated at that appointment is just not acceptable when you are looking for guidance and advice to ensure a positive outcome in your pregnancy.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-11-23T22:04:53.7433333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-11-25T13:50:13.383","readBy":[{"name":"Ulster University, MBBS (Medicine) 2021","count":1},{"name":"NHS Tayside","count":16}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/897919","id":"897919"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/897919/responses","id":"897919"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/897919/healthservices","id":"897919"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/897919/tags","id":"897919"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/t101h_501","id":"T101H_501","score":2},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/t101h_501-apn","id":"T101H_501-APN","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/insulted","id":"insulted"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stressed","id":"stressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/antenatal","id":"antenatal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/belittled","id":"belittled"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dietician","id":"Dietician"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gestational%20diabetes","id":"gestational diabetes"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/guidance","id":"guidance"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/haematology","id":"haematology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/intimidated","id":"intimidated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/judged","id":"judged"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/listening","id":"listening"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/midwives","id":"midwives"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/patient%20care","id":"patient care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pregnancy","id":"pregnancy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/preparation","id":"preparation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/read%20notes","id":"Read notes"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attitude","id":"staff attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/understanding","id":"understanding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassuring","id":"reassuring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/involved%20in%20decisions","id":"involved in decisions"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/spoken%20over","id":"spoken over"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blamed","id":"blamed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/listened%20to","id":"listened to"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/898701","id":"898701"}]},{"id":898337,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Wonderful team of staff","body":"I recently underwent total knee replacement surgery and from the moment I stepped onto ward 18 the care I received was outstanding.

When he got there he was transferred to CDU and kept an eye on, before being discharged home he took a really bad turn and stopped breathing for several seconds. The staff being quick acting managed to keep bringing him round and not only that when the situation was stressful, they helped reassure my husband and I that everything was going to be okay.  \r\nHe was then placed upstairs to the ICU where I can’t thank the staff enough, Nicola was absolutely amazing with him on day shift and I felt that she gave him the love especially when I wasn’t there in the morning and when going home. Nightshift we sadly never met but always happy and chatty when we called and had nothing but lovely things to say about my boy!  \r\nHe was then moved along to ward 2C who were just amazing. They went out of their way for not only him but myself and my husband. Always making sure we were okay and if we ever needed anything. No question was a silly question, we became a bit paranoid about his breathing but the lovely nurse put him on the sats machine and pulse machine so it could ease our minds he was doing just as amazing as they all said! Nightshift we’re lovely and I cannot fault them at all! Making sure it was okay to check him over (always was of course) but just not wanting to disturb him too much!  \r\nI honestly will be forever grateful for this service and what they have done for us. From the paramedics who stayed with me until he was admitted to the ward, to every single staff member and also the student nurses who dealt with him they will forever hold a special place in my heart especially when I thought I was going to loose my little boy!","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-11-24T18:19:02.64","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-11-25T16:01:48.043","readBy":[{"name":"Scottish Ambulance Service","count":10},{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":9}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/898193","id":"898193"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/898193/responses","id":"898193"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/898193/healthservices","id":"898193"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/898193/tags","id":"898193"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/scot-ambulance-emergency","id":"scot-ambulance-emergency","score":5},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sj9-children-picu","id":"sj9-children-picu","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/answering%20questions","id":"answering questions"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breathing","id":"breathing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bronchiolitis","id":"bronchiolitis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/heart","id":"heart"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lovely","id":"lovely"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/paramedics","id":"paramedics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/respected","id":"respected"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing","id":"amazing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happy","id":"happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassuring","id":"reassuring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support%20for%20family","id":"support for family"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/898399","id":"898399"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/899738","id":"899738"}]},{"id":898194,"author":"PregFalk2021","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Not feeling safe in the Forth Valley Women and Children Wing","body":"All staff are lovely and friendly.

It's bad enough feeling ill as well as facing a sour face. It's a long time since I'd been here. Now I see why? On my previous visits I had the same thing, so not much has changed. A little bit of empathy to a patient goes a long way. Back to my paperwork the receptionist couldn't find it. So I had to go back for this paperwork the following day when it was found. But I have to say once you get past the receptionist and irritating  automation service and see a doctor whom are always considerate. They deserve all the credit. They are the people whom make patients feel their self worth. So why is it so hard to see any of them.

I rang back Wednesday to be told no and my gp is on annual leave from Thursday until the middle of December but I could ring the week before he back and prebook a telephone consultation.. I was also told to ring on Thursday and get the duty gp which I did .. and was then told because my dr actually doesn’t start his holiday until after today I couldn’t book any telephone consultations with him nor could I with the duty gp.. I was advised to ring again tomorrow and I informed the receptionist that I was working all day tomorrow On a ward from 7 until 9.30  and I possibly couldn’t ring but could I book for tomorrow I was told no… so another week has gone and I remain in pain..
