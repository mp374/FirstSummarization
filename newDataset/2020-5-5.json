[{"id":768291,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Covid-19 but the staff keep going!","body":"In the last two weeks I have had to speak to two of the GPs - 3 times - feeling that I was being bothersome with an infection I had. I was so anxious each time I spoke to the doctors as I knew the risks of the infection getting worse without the right treatment. The first doctor listened to me read my notes and took a pragmatic view of what should happen given the circumstances of only call appointments the second GP was equally pragmatic and thanks to their care  and attentiveness  I am hopefully on the right medication. The second GP spent took time to explain my results to me so I understood clearly what should happen, this at 5pm I am sure at the end of a very long day, I appreciated that extra care and reassurance. At a time when NHS staff are under so much strain I cannot begin to say how lovely the reception staff I spoke to were - kind and helpful.  Doctors have to work in these strange and frightening times and my experience of them was just amazing, they were understanding, Kind and supportive.  I really am lost for words - continuing to work and knowing the risks - but yet continuing to do their jobs. One of the reception ladies went above and beyond for me and I am so grateful she did because today I was able to receive some results which means I am now on a prescription that will help me recover and I know if it doesn’t I feel confident I can call the surgery if I need. In comparison to what other have had to go through I felt my illness was insignificant - but it wasn’t and being in lockdown and sick has been a really awful experience. I have to care for my mum who  needs shopping housework etc as she cannot go out and having to work full time has meant being ill wasn’t really an  option for me. My absolute heartfelt thanks and appreciation to you all at Croft !

Despite the fact I had to wait nearly 2 hours to be seen by the health advisor plus another hour on top of this for the actual procedure, I cannot fault the doctors and the anaesthetist who were amazing throughout and reassured me during the whole process before I was put to sleep. Whilst the care during my op was amazing, I felt that after the procedure I was rushed out of the recovery room despite being told I had to stay there for at least an hour to be monitored after having a general anaesthetic. I was also feeling pretty rough and in tears from painful stomach cramps. I hadn’t even finished the refreshments I was given to me 5 minutes previous before being told to go to the toilet get changed and leave. I was also given 2 boxes of antibiotics to take at home however, the nurse did not make it clear to me when I had to take them which resulted in me having to call the after care line when I got home. Overall not an unpleasant experience but I feel that the nurses could have been a bit more clearer with their instructions and allowed the correct recovery time before discharging instead of rushing people out the door which was a bit disappointing.

However, when trying to obtain my repeat prescription a few months later, I found out that the support team had never sent a reference to my GP and therefore could not be given the medication I needed. I contacted the home support service to ask them to if they could e-mail over my reference so I could sort out my prescription, and was left in tears after talking to a certain individual from the home support team. They were extremely rude and unpleasant and they did in fact make me cry and leave me too anxious to call back, I had to get my mum to do so for me. In doing so she spoke to the same person, who continued to be rude, unhelpful and disrespectful to her. As as vulnerable young adult I do not expect this sort of unkindness from a person who's job it is to help - I was not rude or unpleasant to this person, I was just asking for some help, and to be treated this way in return is unnecessary. I had been really pleased with the help I had received from the home support team up until today, however, the treatment I received from this individual has meant my opinion has been swayed. Thankfully when I did finally have the courage to phone back the phone was answered by a gentleman who was extremely kind and helpful. It is a shame that not all of the staff are like this, especially when they work with people who are struggling.

This resulted in me worrying about my babies wellbeing and I did have several trips to maternity assessment, some were reassuring and others I was made to feel like a nuisance. I wrote a letter to the lead midwife and didn't receive any sort of response which I found extremely disappointing, I’m not going to go into detail about this as I went into fine details in that letter.  \r\nI was having my appointments at the new victoria and a referral for the perinatal team was put in due to a preexisting anxiety disorder I have, I was told that I wouldn’t be getting treatment and support from them because of the anxiety disorder, I was sent to wellbeing glasgow and was eventually enrolled in a CBT class that was no use to me as it offered advise such as “try not to think about the things that make you feel anxious” when that was impossible because my main anxiety trigger was if my baby was ok, if he was moving - I certainly couldnt just switch those thoughts off. The fact that the perinatal team didn’t support me when they deal with the mental health of pregnant woman is extremely disappointing and I feel like things would be a bit easier and not as extreme if I did have their support.  \r\nI was eventually referred to the day care unit by my consultant and went to see the midwives there, they were all fantastic especially Linda & Joan, They made me feel so at ease especially on my really bad days and made the end of my pregnancy so much better.  \r\nIn early November I went to maternity assessment concerned about my babies movements, Siobhan was the midwife looking after me and she and the doctor decided it was better for my baby and me to be induced and booked my induction for the next morning. (3 days before my due date) I went in for my induction at 10am and it was a fairly straightforward process, I went into labour at 3am successfully after 2 pessary’s and was taken to the labour suite not long after, everyone was great support knowing about how anxious I was feeling. Stacey delivered my baby boy and did everything she could to coach me, support me and make sure we were both well.  \r\nI had a suspected infection and we were both given IV antibiotics. I was kept in a ward in the labour ward for the first night for this and was taken care by jill (sorry if this isnt the right name the days were a bit hazy) and she was great also. When I was taken up to ward 49/50 not sure which one it was, I was obviously more actively trying to breastfeed my baby and that in its self was stressful, there was a wonderful student nurse who helped me with breastfeeding positions, but I found that every worker had their own opinions on what was right and what was wrong when it came to the way I was feeding him, one thing was right to one and the next person said that was wrong, it was extremely stressful and I felt confused and deflated.  \r\nMy mental state got worse on the second evening & I was finding things very hard to cope with. I am sure all new mothers feel a bit like this but the head midwife put in a referral to perinatal mental health team again after that night as she could see I was struggling. (I was rejected from their care once again despite my diagnosis of postnatal depression)  \r\nAfter the second nights stay with baby (3rd in total) I was ready to be discharged. I was sitting in my cubicle trying to feed my baby and was interrupted by a midwife who told me to take him with me to the day room for the discharge meeting. I unlatched him and carried him though, I was given into trouble for not having him in his cot (I was totally unaware and uninformed that it was the way I should be transporting him around the ward. ) once myself and another new mum sat down for the discharge meeting this midwife basically said “right I need you to ask all the questions you have about cot death” and then went on to tell me that I shouldn’t swaddle my baby, especially in more than one layer, which multiple medical staff had done to him in the hospital during our stay, and spoke at great length about cot death. I understand the importance of this but I feel like it should be covered during pregnancy not when you are holding your tiny newborn in your arms hours before you are due to go home, exhausted after the most trauma your body has ever gone through. By the end of the discharge meeting I was extremely frightened to take my baby home, this lead for an extremely traumatic first night at home where I didn’t want to be in the same room as him out of fear he would die.  \r\nMy partner and my mum were extremely worried about my wellbeing that night and when I had my first midwife visit at home she helped me arrange an appointment with a GP who prescribed me antidepressants. My baby turns 6 months soon and I am still suffering badly with postnatal depression. The midwives who visited me the first 2 weeks were amazing support, my health visitor (Maureen based in the govan health centre) has been my rock but I cannot help but feel there are some things that happened during my pregnancy that could have been done differently that would have reduced the severity of my postnatal depression.","criticality":"moderately

My father was transferred to PBL for end of life care post-COVID. The NNUH was much more relaxed in terms of visiting for end of life patients i.e. close family and no time restrictions. PBL is: the same person can only visit for the duration of stay and for a maximum of 1 hour per day. If the persons starts to shows signs of imminent death then you cant visit if you have had your quota for the day!  \r\nI find this baffling for a facility dedicated to EOL care! I don't understand why the 1-hour rule is relevant for IPC issues? I'm visiting someone on a COVID bay so they already have COVID. I have also had COVID and therefore cannot see the risk? I thought the government stance was that you should relax these rules for someone in the last days of their life?  \r\nI appreciate you are a different Trust to NNUH but you should all be broadly following the same rules surrounding visiting and be following the government.  \r\nI've also got to say that the bay is not what I expected for EOL care, its very clinical. I am a health care professional myself but thought there may be some 'homely' touches to the bay to make it feel less 'clinical' for the patients and relatives. Whilst I highly appreciate the care and dedication from the staff I feel you could look at this as a Trust.  \r\nSimple things such as take away the monotony of the 'white clinical' feel. Put some colourful pictures up at the very least? I was a bit surprised to see this after never hearing anything negative about PBL. As a hospice type facility, I would have thought these issues would not be apparent.  \r\nSimple things like this can help the patients and relatives have a peaceful death and assist with any post-traumatic stress. I am more than happy to assist and give some ideas from an external perspective. The entrance to PBL is colourful but this stops as soon as you reach the bays. EOL facilities need to decorated differently to usual healthcare facilities. I appreciate IPC, but pictures do not interfere with IPC requirements at all.  \r\nNo issue with staff, they just weren't aware Dad had a CD player, didn't have his glasses on and TV not on. The glasses would help with one of his senses for his EOL care as we don't know if he can still see, but if he can, the glasses would help. All Dads belongings were still in bags, I thought all property was documented on arrival. I explained CD's would help Dad, again with his senses, but it appears they weren't aware he had this in his property.  \r\nI am highly supportive of the staff, especially with the COVID crisis, so please don't take my comments critically. Hopefully, they can help you to see from an external perspective of someone who has never had to use PBL before. A doctor called me to explain Dad had arrived but I think a nursing call is required to go through Dads other needs other than his acute medical/nursing needs which was handed over.  \r\nThese things are important for EOL care and can really help a patient and family in their relatives last few days. This can assist with the patient's distress and the relative's grief process. By a nursing relative handover I mean what has happened twice at the NNUH when a dementia nurse has called and gone through his 'This is me Passport'. To give examples, things to talk about with the patient (in my fathers case his cat who he adores), favourite TV (you have loads of channels, and free not like the NNUH), favourite music, do they want headphones on, religious needs, personal care, bed positioning, what they were like before the palliative time etc.  \r\nMore of a social gathering of information but exactly similar to the passport I mentioned. To me, the more I write it seems like Dad has been dumped here and we are just waiting for him to die. It really isn't what I thought the EOL period would be like, make us feel like Dad is important to you, don't dump him in a bed with no glasses on, belongings still in bags, no stimulation from TV or music. I encouraged the NNUH to put Dad in a hospice and the care was great with calls from consultants etc. I really thought PBL was the place to be for someones last few days but at the moment I feel quite upset by the, what seems to be, lack of organisational care for my Father.  \r\nIt saddens me to say I wouldn't actually recommend PBL because of this. If I could, I would have Dad at his flat but this is impossible due to stairs and I would have nursed him myself. It just feels Dad is unimportant as you haven't found out anything 'personal and social' about him, just the nursing and medical handovers. These are important things as otherwise the dementia passport 'this is me' document wouldn't exist. I would have thought an EOL facility would have been different and much more switched on to these needs, so I am quite surprised.  \r\nMainly, I didn't want Dad to die alone in the NNUH in a side room, so I am glad of the care provided by PBL and the nurses being with Dad when he passes. Again, a lot of these issues are Trust-wide and out of the hands of the nurses. But a few points described may assist with the family and patient, the grief process and the final few days of life. Palliative care in my job is an interest of mine and I go the extra mile as I know what effect it can have on families and the patient. I have experienced the death of a young friend with family present and the experience was peaceful. I cannot think how this situation with my Father will be the same due to the issues I've raised and the overcompensating that the Trust is doing with IPC which is in contradiction to Government advice for visiting imminent EOL patients.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-05-03T23:20:34.7433333","progress":"Change

I was not surprised to hear this, my experience of NHS staff is that they are amazing ALL of the time and have easily risen to the COVID challenge!  \r\nI was assessed for around five hours by the superb team of nurses, and cannot thank enough the young lady doctor from Northern Ireland who probably saved my life by spending the time to work out that I had probably had a pulmonary embolism.  \r\nShe sent me upstairs and later I had a scan that showed two blood clots in my right lung. I am very fit for my age, love cycling, and would have continued as a ‘west coast man’ until something gave out.  \r\nLadies, you are all amazing, thank you so much for the care you gave me!","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-05-04T13:01:57.62","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-05-05T10:35:04.453","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Grampian","count":4},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/763799","id":"763799"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/763799/responses","id":"763799"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/763799/healthservices","id":"763799"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/763799/tags","id":"763799"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/n101h_320","id":"N101H_320","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/n494h_300","id":"N494H_300","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood","id":"blood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cardiac","id":"cardiac"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cycling","id":"cycling"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dizzy","id":"dizzy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/get%20fit","id":"get fit"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lung","id":"lung"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professionalism","id":"professionalism"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pulmonary","id":"pulmonary"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pulmonary%20embolism","id":"pulmonary embolism"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scan","id":"scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/team","id":"team"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/test","id":"test"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/saved","id":"saved"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/768395","id":"768395"}]},{"id":759759,"author":"Bromley","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Stroke","body":"My wife of 36 years had a stroke at home on Saturday at 7am.

A very elderly lady - in her late eighties or nineties at a guess - queued up in front of me at the dispensary.  She appeared to have struggled to get to the surgery, being unaware that she would not be seen.  She had something wrong with her upper leg or thereabouts (I turned away so as not to intrude) and showed the dispensary assistant.  The assistant said she had to make an appointment and told her to ring the intercom bell by the surgery door.  She eventually did this but struggled with getting in the right place for the camera.  The surgery receptionist just kept telling her over the intercom that she had to go home and ring for an appointment, and never asked for her name.  I suspect she might have struggled with this or she would not have made the trip in the first place.  This was an instance crying out for some compassion and common sense, even if the receptionist had had to put on PPE to come out.  Or the dispensary assistant could have helped her.  Or the receptionist could have said someone would phone her.  Instead, the surgery had an unknown patient who went away confused and upset and may not have been able to do as she was instructed.\n\nI emailed the practice manager rather than using this site, but received an automated reply saying that he was away from the practice with no access to email.  That is the only email address the practice gives, so there is no way to contact them other than telephoning.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-05-05T14:18:14","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-05-05T18:01:43","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/768354","id":"768354"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/768354/responses","id":"768354"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/768354/healthservices","id":"768354"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/768354/tags","id":"768354"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/a82026","id":"A82026","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confused","id":"confused"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/distressing","id":"distressing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20upset","id":"very upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/camera","id":"camera"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/elderly","id":"elderly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helped","id":"helped"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/leg","id":"leg"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/768803","id":"768803"}]},{"id":768355,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Appalling service","body":"I was referred to this organisation by my GP in January 2020.

She had a stroke in December and had not been home long, her carers had been pulled 2 weeks before she had her fall due to COVID-19.  \r\nMy mother has asked to see my grandmother one last time she was first told this would not be possible but then was told she would be allowed 1 hour at some point when they see fit.  \r\nMy mother was asked to pick up my dying grandmother's washing today and bring her fresh clothes. She went to A&E and asked to see my grandmother, the nurse said no. She went back upstairs and brought someone else down. Who said the nurse who said she would get to see her mum before she passes for it wrong. I have read on NHS Greater Glasgow that there are exception allowed for visiting: 1. End of life care. 2. Birthing partners. 3. Children in hospital. I understand Greater Glasgow is not NHS Tayside. However, this is basic human rights.  \r\nI understand the need to keep staff safe and other patients but your staff came down stairs to collect clothes from my mum not wearing any masks and did not keep their distance, and bringing in clothes from outside a hospital, again this is contradictory. These nurses are going back to the ward where my grandmother is currently dying.  \r\nAll my mum would like is to say goodbye to my granny and be there in person one last time. That is not alot to ask.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-05-05T18:24:21.52","progress":"Made change","dateOfPublication":"2020-05-06T08:44:47.677","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Tayside","count":19},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2020)","count":1},{"name":"St. Andrews University ScotGEM Medical Students","count":2},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":2},{"name":"Scottish Government","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/768359","id":"768359"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/768359/responses","id":"768359"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/768359/healthservices","id":"768359"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/768359/tags","id":"768359"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/t202h_300","id":"T202H_300","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dying","id":"dying"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/end%20of%20life","id":"end of life"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fall","id":"fall"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/heart%20attack","id":"heart attack"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stroke","id":"stroke"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/visiting%20rules","id":"visiting rules"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/conflicting%20information","id":"conflicting information"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/768379","id":"768379"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/768388","id":"768388"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/768410","id":"768410"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/769438","id":"769438"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/769619","id":"769619"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/769813","id":"769813"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/769934","id":"769934"}]},{"id":768381,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Covid assessment ","body":"I am a 59 year old and have been in isolation in my home with my and daughter for 5 weeks.

I gave my details to the receptionist standing back on a yellow line. I sat in a enclosed part of the waiting area.\nI was surprised to get called by a nurse in a 10 minute despite how exhaustingly busy they are the background.\nAfter being assessed the nurse brought in a doctor and confirmed after again explanations that I was coping well with my symptoms. given my readings he expected I would recover over the next 3 days given the length of time in isolation for past 5 weeks when I first contracted mild symptoms. I was told to stay off immune suppressants for week.\nI wasn’t tested for Covid however the doctor managed to assure me not to worry as he could see I was anxious and shaking.\nThe doctor explained how bad patients are before they admitted.\nThough I felt dreadfully unwell  I felt 60% of it was my in my head mentally putting me in panic mode.

Mum had an x ray done and a CT done and they found that mum had a blood clot on one of her lungs. They started antibiotics and a blood thinning medication to get rid of the blood clot in the lung. When the consultant saw mum the day after she was admitted he told her that she was very lucky to have survived because people with underlying health issues as mum has don’t usually pull through in these types of circumstances.  \r\nThat my Mum is still alive today is because of the perseverance of Dr Suen and Dr Liu in persuading mum that she must not be afraid to go to hospital and when she finally agreed to go to the hospital they gave her the medication she needed to stay alive.  \r\nDr Suen and Dr Liu are both great assets of the Lawson Practice.  \r\nDear Dr Suen and Dr Liu I am indebted to you both and I want to say a very big thank you from the bottom of my heart.

Until now I’ve had nothing but praise but I’m afraid I have no cause for further praise.  \r\nWhilst I totally appreciate the pressures that staff are under today I encountered the following:- having sat in the waiting room for 90 minutes I decided to check that my appointment hadn’t been overlooked. What prompted that? It wasn’t the length of time but the fact that two people who’d arrived some time after me were called before me.  \r\nWhilst a nurse went to check, as I was waiting another patient approached the reception desk to check in. I overheard the reception ask if she was a “shielding” patient - she was (as am I but I hadn’t been asked!) and she was told to wait a moment as they needed to provide a mask and gloves. When I questioned this I was told, despite having had my shielding letter some 5 weeks earlier, their records didn’t reflect my status.  \r\nThen the nurse returned to inform me that an emergency patient had arrived which had put me back. She also admitted that I should have been advised that this was the case. At this point I was quickly processed, canula then scan, restoring my long held faith.  \r\nHowever the conclusion to my visit was a sorry one. Walking down the corridor on my way out passing another reception area four porters, three of whom wore face masks, the fourth not and a nurse were in conversation across the width of the corridor. I stopped and looked at the porter without the mask and asked if I could pass as there was NOT enough space to permit social distancing. At this they stepped aside clearly unhappy at my comment. I did hear the comment from the group to the tune of “it takes all kinds eh?” This didn’t impress me.  \r\nI’m sorry I’ve felt inclined to tell this story but I feel there are few lessons to be learned in the hope that others don’t encounter similar issues.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-05-05T16:01:03.58","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-05-06T09:34:21.147","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lothian","count":18},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/768338","id":"768338"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/768338/responses","id":"768338"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/768338/healthservices","id":"768338"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/768338/tags","id":"768338"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/s116h_800","id":"S116H_800","score":3},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ct%20scan","id":"CT scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kept%20informed","id":"kept informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/patient%20records","id":"patient records"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attitude","id":"staff attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unhappy","id":"unhappy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting%20time","id":"waiting time"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/768934","id":"768934"}]},{"id":768391,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Excellent service","body":"During the covid-19 pandemic, I needed to visit my GP.

I woke up that morning with complete anxiety that it was all going to go wrong and that there would complications during it. I was met by a midwife called Gillian who was so kind and reassuring and gave me rough time frames of when each thing would happen.  \r\nFollowing that, I met with the two most amazing midwifes and anaesthetist who would be with me & my partner during my birth called Marj and Maryann, and the anaesthetist Sarah. These 3 amazing woman kept me extremely calm and relaxed as well as my partner throughout the whole process to the point I actually never knew they had started the procedure until minutes before our baby boy was born! There was just constant positivity in the room and they all made the experience the complete opposite from what my brain had mapped it out to be. They took amazing care of me as well as my partner during the procedure and we can’t thank them enough for the extreme amount of care taken on such a special day. I really hope they know how much of a great job they are doing.  \r\nI would like to thank the amazing surgeons as well who I never caught the names of, but a massive massive thank you for taking amazing care of me during my operation and delivering our precious baby safely! Again I hope they know how amazing they are doing.  \r\nThen onto the ward - I was transferred to ward 47 where, again I was taken care of tremendously. All of the midwifes/doctors on ward 47 are amazing! And we’re there in a flash the minute I needed them with again constant reassurance and kindness. There is one midwife who dealt with me most during that night and the next day her name was Rebecca. She was so patient & kind to me and made me feel so safe again I hope she knows how much of an amazing job she is doing and what a great person she is. I’d like to point out that I actually was made to feel safer in hospital than out with covid 19 going on! Other than the PPE, I completely forgot all about it whilst in hospital. I was just so focused on my perfect baby boy. I really hope others who are due to give birth can see this and see how cared for you are and feel reassured.  \r\nThank you so much from the bottom of my heart to all of the staff who dealt with me. I will be forever grateful.

So I called the Recovery Team West on numerous occasions which all went unanswered. I then gave up and called the single point of access and they could not get through to them either. I then kept calling the team and finally someone answered the phone, I was told all the appointments were cancelled many weeks ago and that another appointment could not be booked as they are changing the appointment system. Once that's complete, a doctor will risk assess patients and book appointments accordingly.  \r\nThis was a terrible response. I had waited for this appointment for many months and have not been seen since last year. I then called to speak to a manager, I was told they were unavailable and they would pass a message on. To this day nobody has called me. I have had enough of the terrible service from this team, to not answering the phone, rude staff, promises that are never carried out and just the overall lack of care for the patients.  \r\nIn my experience, none of the doctors seem to stay at this team for long which is more concerning.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-05-05T16:38:42.5933333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-05-06T10:02:51.527","readBy":[{"name":"West London NHS Trust","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/768340","id":"768340"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/768340/responses","id":"768340"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/768340/healthservices","id":"768340"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/768340/tags","id":"768340"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rkl05-recovery-west","id":"rkl05-recovery-west","score":1},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/angry","id":"angry"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/annoyed","id":"annoyed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lack%20of%20care","id":"Lack of care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cancelled%20appointments","id":"cancelled appointments"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/continuity%20of%20care","id":"continuity of care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fed%20up","id":"fed up"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kept%20informed","id":"kept informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/contactable","id":"contactable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/conflicting%20information","id":"conflicting information"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/coronavirus","id":"coronavirus"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/769074","id":"769074"}]},{"id":768347,"author":"HelM","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"They have been utterly outstanding","body":"We have used Stonehaven Medical Centre since moving to the town 20 years ago and their service has always been excellent.

I met a lovely friendly midwife Rhiannon, she was newly qualified & I would never have known unless it came up in conversation. She told me the doctor wanted me induced, this I may say was without seeing this doctor or any signs baby was is distress. Reluctantly we headed off to the inpatient ward for the process to start. Here we met yet another great midwife Hazel, she sensed my apprehension about induction without me saying a word and decided to put me on a CTG to check on baby, look again at my contractions & then chat about induction.  \r\nFrom these results she felt induction wouldn’t be needed & informed the doctor of this (who again I had yet to meet, it is now 12:30ish) and they were happy to hold off and watch & see. Hazel checked on us throughout the afternoon, her care for the women also in my room was clear. Come early evening things were much the same & no signs of baby was in a rush to come see us. Hazel informed me the doctor was in touch for an update & wanted to come chat to me about induction. Hazel was due to go off shift but chatted to me about this & reassured me that I had choices & it would soon prove this chat was so valuable to me to give me confidence at this vulnerable time to not be forced into something. I cannot thank Hazel enough for being my advocate & reassure me I had a voice, it was lovely to see her the next day in the midwifery suite. She popped in to see how we had got on when down in the suite, truly showing her genuine interest in the women she cares for.  \r\nAnyway the doctor I finally got to meet at after 8pm, who gave me two choices,  \r\n1. They told me the labour ward was currently quiet so I could be induced now or,  \r\n2. I could wait until morning for induction but they wouldn’t be able to guarantee when the labour ward would be able to take me as it maybe busier by then!!  \r\nI kid you not that was the options they gave me, my husband was there & heard it all too. Now by this point it had been hours since I had been on a CTG & they gave me no clinical reason to move to induction. I in fact asked them if there was any risk to my baby at this point as they hadn’t mentioned any reason why we needed induced. At this point they said they did ask for another CTG & checked how dilated I was. I opted for an induction in the morning, it was clear they weren't happy about it by their tone & manner. Again thank goodness for Hazel my midwife talking to me beforehand as I feel otherwise I may have felt coerced into this induction by the doctor.  \r\nMy care was now under yet another wonderful midwife call Danika, my labour started to progress quickly and I was soon moved to the midwifery suite by her, though she cared for me briefly, her words of comfort & making attempts to get me moved ASAP will be always remembered.  \r\nWe then met Deborah, who was on shift alone in the midwifery suite with a bank nurse to assist her. She helped guide us through options, such as pain relief, birth pool, aromatherapy scents etc. I was left in the care of a midwife called Dawn when Deborah needed breaks & again though we met Dawn briefly, she took left a lasting positive impression on us.  \r\nSo after my waters finally break (turns out not all of them had gone) my little girl arrived very swiftly after this.  \r\nThough a long story I wanted to convey that each midwife I met that day & my final midwife Kirsten who discharged us all left a lasting impression for myself & my husband. They listened to us, got to know us & our baby was at the forefront of their care even in the short time we met some of them. I am thankful for all of them & that because of them I didn’t feel bullied into an induction when clearly this was not required.  \r\nThank you and your management team should be proud of you.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-05-05T20:25:57.4766667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-05-06T11:05:44.097","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Ayrshire & Arran","count":8},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/768368","id":"768368"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/768368/responses","id":"768368"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/768368/healthservices","id":"768368"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/768368/tags","id":"768368"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/a111h_501","id":"A111H_501","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/advocate","id":"advocate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/birth","id":"birth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20about","id":"Cared about"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/contractions","id":"contractions"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ctg","id":"ctg"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/induction","id":"induction"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/labour","id":"labour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/midwives","id":"midwives"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20for","id":"cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported","id":"supported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thankful","id":"Thankful"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/768421","id":"768421"}]},{"id":768408,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Excellent Service","body":"I was referred to the practice by my GP for what was potential skin cancer.

I received a call saying I needed to come for an appointment for a radiology - with the person on the phone not being able to tell me if it is for an x-ray or ultrasound nor for which part of the body. I go to radiology for the said appointment and I am told, that since I am pregnant, I need to go to women's health. I go to women's health and they say they have no appointment for me and ask me to go back to radiology. I have spent then 40min walking around the hospital between the green zone and yellow zone without being able to talk to someone who can tell me what this appointment is about. I arrive back at radiology and push them to confirm if I have an appointment or if the call I had received was a joke. Finally, I am able to speak to someone who confirm it is for an ultrasound and finds which room I need to go to...but turns out they wanted me to have a kidney ultrasound...which I already had in the past. Complete waste of time. I spent over 1h walking around the hospital trying to figure out what this appointment was for. It's really unnecessary to call patients and play with them like ping pong during a pandemic! This is not the first time I suffer from this hospital badly organisation, I have had a couple of appointments at women's health moved, without being told which as a result meant I missed some appointments. They really need to put a better organisation system in place.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-05-06T09:37:43","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-05-06T14:40:17","readBy":[{"name":"Lewisham and Greenwich NHS Trust","count":2}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/768429","id":"768429"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/768429/responses","id":"768429"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/768429/healthservices","id":"768429"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/768429/tags","id":"768429"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rj224","id":"RJ224","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kidney","id":"kidney"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pregnant","id":"pregnant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/radiology","id":"radiology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ultrasound","id":"ultrasound"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/women's","id":"women's"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/x-ray","id":"X-ray"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/786646","id":"786646"}]},{"id":768369,"author":"FEB20","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Great birth experience and care","body":"I gave birth to my second baby by elective section at the RAH Paisley in February.  \r\nMy antenatal care at the Mid-Argyll Maternity Unit was fantastic from start to finish.
