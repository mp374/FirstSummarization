So I phoned the Good Hope hospital to say that I would wait for a QE appointment and would they cancel my appointment.  They said they would and that they would refer me back to the QE.  When I phoned the QE a couple of days ago they told me that I'd been put down as a did not attend which is disgusting.  Fortunately I have now been given an appointment at the QE.

For all other medical input I’ve gone privately but need Gp to prescribe more analgesia.The receptionist looked on the screen and said but you’ve only just had. This is because I’m taking the top end amount. She made no attempt to ask me about pain or how I was, or even suggest any help. I asked about patient access. She said to fill in online (but I couldn’t find) She said she didn’t know how, she didn’t attempt to look it up or help. I thought using this service so I don’t have to phone would be better for reception team. I’ve written a letter and dropped off now - certainly won’t phone again. I just felt her manner was offhand. In general find all the staff like that. I think they should know  patients  do not want to phone up, it’s generally done to get help. Luckily I went privately for part of my treatment. There is such a difference in the attitudes of staff in the private sector. They trip over theirselves to help you. They smile. They make you feel valid. When you are unwell you just need to know someone cares. I am a nurse and treat my patients how I’d like to be treated. So why can’t they?

I was examined by a doctor who pronounced no serious injuries and that I would be able to go home. This, without any Xrays or scan. Whilst waiting in a corridor on a stretcher,  I overheard nursing staff saying that they were sure I should not be discharged and not long after that the same doctor came and said having consulted his superior, it was all change and that I was to be sent for both a scan and X-rays which revealed I had a fractured rib and that I would be staying in the hospital overnight. The next doctor on duty was excellent. She asked if any of my grazes had been washed and I told her that they had not. The most difficult things in my experience were related to delays in bringing pain relief and a bedpan when I urgently needed them. At 18:30 my husband let the nursing staff know that I needed pain relief and was told it would be coming. He asked on two more occasions, but it was not until 20:30 that the painkillers arrived. Similarly when I needed a bed pan, the nurse said \"Just a sec\" and it was 30 minutes before it arrived, during which holding in my urine added greatly to my pain and discomfort. It is understandable if nurses have other urgent priorities to attend to first, but they should be trained to make truthful statements, such as \"I need to attend to a patient giving birth first\" rather than \"just a sec\" which raises hopes of something being likely to happen within about 5 minutes. I know the nursing staff were under a lot of pressure, but I was disappointed that urgent needs took so long to be seen to. The third doctor I saw on the morning before I left was excellent. Incidentally my husband had a message on his mobile asking for a review of his experience at the X-ray department, which was fine, but I have had no similar message on my mobile regarding X-ray and scan experiences (both OK) or my time in accident and emergency.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2023-06-08T12:37:00","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-06-11T13:35:04","readBy":[{"name":"University Hospitals of North Midlands NHS Trust","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1076709","id":"1076709"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1076709/responses","id":"1076709"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1076709/healthservices","id":"1076709"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1076709/tags","id":"1076709"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rje01","id":"RJE01","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disappointed","id":"disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/birth","id":"birth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency","id":"emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fortunate","id":"fortunate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/giving%20birth","id":"giving birth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/in%20pain","id":"in pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain%20relief","id":"pain relief"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/painkillers","id":"painkillers"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/relief","id":"relief"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scan","id":"scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/x-ray","id":"X-ray"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/x-rays","id":"x-rays"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20disappointed","id":"very disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fine","id":"fine"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/under%20pressure","id":"under pressure"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/injuries","id":"injuries"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1082913","id":"1082913"}]},{"id":1076710,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Urology","body":"I had to attend Haematuria Clinic in Urology under the 2 week pathway for tests so was obviously very apprehensive about results.
