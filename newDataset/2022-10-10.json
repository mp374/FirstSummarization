She did not apologise or sympathise, and simply contradicted me saying 'they are answering calls'. I have the proof on my phone that the phone system was not working again. The surgery acknowledges this is a problem on this very website. Why lie to me? Besides which, 3 of them were just chatting away doing nothing at all when I walked in. She then haughtily told me not to speak to her like that- I was calm in tone, I had not raised my voice, I was not making comments about her, I was explaining that was going on and I had a right to be upset. She did not care. World Mental Health day today! I made a complaint last week which surprise surprise, no-one has responded to and am still waiting for confirmation of whether a prescription has been renewed two weeks later.

If they are unable to address the issues, whether that be GP staffing levels or some other problem, the least they need to do is explain this to us, the patients. \n\nWhere is the communications strategy? Simply be up front with patients about the problems you are facing and how waiting lists and appointment availability is being tackled. Put it on your website or something. \n\nIn the meantime, surely thereâ€™s a triage system?
