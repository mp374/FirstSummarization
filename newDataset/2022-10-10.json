This week I gave up after calling 25 times and the call being disconnected and went in. Receptionist was extremely arrogant and uncaring. She did not apologise or sympathise, and simply contradicted me saying 'they are answering calls'. I have the proof on my phone that the phone system was not working again. The surgery acknowledges this is a problem on this very website. Why lie to me? Besides which, 3 of them were just chatting away doing nothing at all when I walked in. She then haughtily told me not to speak to her like that- I was calm in tone, I had not raised my voice, I was not making comments about her, I was explaining that was going on and I had a right to be upset. She did not care. World Mental Health day today! I made a complaint last week which surprise surprise, no-one has responded to and am still waiting for confirmation of whether a prescription has been renewed two weeks later. This surgery is an actual danger to health and the receptionists urgently need proper training.

If they are unable to address the issues, whether that be GP staffing levels or some other problem, the least they need to do is explain this to us, the patients. \n\nWhere is the communications strategy? Simply be up front with patients about the problems you are facing and how waiting lists and appointment availability is being tackled. Put it on your website or something. \n\nIn the meantime, surely there’s a triage system? A baby with a high fever being looked after by two parents with Covid surely qualifies as a priority. \n\n","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-10-10T08:10:34","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-10-10T09:34:23","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/983653","id":"983653"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/983653/responses","id":"983653"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/983653/healthservices","id":"983653"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/983653/tags","id":"983653"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/b81011","id":"B81011","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/concern","id":"concern"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stressed","id":"stressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fever","id":"fever"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/high%20temperature","id":"high temperature"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lack%20of%20sleep","id":"lack of sleep"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/looked%20after","id":"looked after"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/positive","id":"positive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/priority","id":"priority"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/temperature","id":"temperature"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/triage","id":"triage"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/weak","id":"weak"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/worse%20than%20before","id":"worse than before"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid","id":"covid"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%2019","id":"covid 19"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20looked%20after","id":"not looked after"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20a%20priority","id":"not a priority"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/984574","id":"984574"}]},{"id":983652,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Great and exemplary service","body":"Well organised with professional execution and very good listening ear with prompt handling and actioning of complaints ","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-10-10T09:30:52","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2022-10-10T09:37:46","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/983652","id":"983652"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/983652/responses","id":"983652"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/983652/healthservices","id":"983652"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/983652/tags","id":"983652"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/d81046","id":"D81046","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ear","id":"ear"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20good","id":"not good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doing%20well","id":"doing well"}]},{"id":983664,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"As efficient as ever!","body":"Once again The Leiston Surgery delivered a smoothly efficient, friendly and professional ‘flu and COVID vaccination programme.
