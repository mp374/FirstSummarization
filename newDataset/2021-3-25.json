The only thing that kept me there was my maternity folder which they refused to give back to me. And not surprisingly, by the time the doctor finally decided to see me at around 9pm, they asked why I had decided to come in if I was only having an abdominal discomfort which I found extremely rude after waiting over 5 hours to see him, I then told them that it was my midwife who told me to come into zone 4 and they said I was fine to go.  \r\nMy horrendous experience was not only for the waiting time but how inhumane I felt treated and also watched other pregnant women treated the same way especially the ones in worst conditions. This is a new experience for me and I know I'm not the only one but I feel that one of the ways I can heal from this experience is to speak out.  \r\nThis system has got to change, it shouldn't be OK to treat people let alone pregnant woman this way. An hospital will not tolerate a patient's rudeness and disrespectful behaviour towards a member of staff so why is it ok for hospital staffs I.e. doctors, nurse, midwives etc to treat patients with such behaviour?","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-03-24T01:13:12.2866667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-03-25T08:15:39.373","readBy":[{"name":"Barts Health NHS Trust","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/834663","id":"834663"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/834663/responses","id":"834663"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/834663/healthservices","id":"834663"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/834663/tags","id":"834663"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/r1hnh_501","id":"R1HNH_501","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sad","id":"sad"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stress","id":"stress"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/abdominal","id":"abdominal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/abdominal%20pain","id":"abdominal pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/alone","id":"alone"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disrespected","id":"disrespected"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/maternity","id":"maternity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/midwives","id":"midwives"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pregnancy","id":"pregnancy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pregnant","id":"pregnant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/the%20change","id":"the change"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/traumatised","id":"traumatised"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting%20time","id":"waiting time"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fair%20treatment","id":"fair treatment"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/835161","id":"835161"}]},{"id":834792,"author":"Grass","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Pollinex Immunotherapy","body":"I've been receiving treatment at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary for a severe grass allergy.  \r\nThe treatment and staff were absolutely fantastic.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-03-24T10:58:21.8933333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-03-25T08:36:22.11","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Grampian","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/834792","id":"834792"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/834792/responses","id":"834792"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/834792/healthservices","id":"834792"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/834792/tags","id":"834792"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/n101h-immunology","id":"N101H-immunology","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/allergy","id":"allergy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/caring","id":"caring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/facilities","id":"facilities"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/knowledgeable","id":"knowledgeable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/safe","id":"safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fantastic","id":"fantastic"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/838347","id":"838347"}]},{"id":835152,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Excellent customer service.

From the initial assessment at A&E, where my ankle was deftly relocated by a nurse to the:  consultants, doctors, nurses, health care staff and ultimately surgeons and anaesthetists involved in my treatment and surgery on both the surgical and T&O wards; I was completely impressed by their dedication, incredible skill and hard work during very long shifts. They always showed compassionate care towards patients. My treatment plan was faultless, cohesive and speedy, involving many departments such as X-ray, Physiotherapy and Occupational Health. I was kept fully informed about treatment, medication and possible outcomes post- surgery, as a patient who needed care and I was never made to feel as if I was just a name on a busy list. I witnessed many incidents of genuine sensitivity and compassion from ward nurses handling patients with complex needs and frankly do not know where they find their energy from during their twelve hour shifts. I have always appreciated and rated the NHS highly but it is only when one witnesses the work of staff, that you are made to realise the enormity of their workload, especially during this pandemic. I wholeheartedly applaud them all and thank everyone involved in my care and especially to the surgical team for putting my ankle back together, also to the recovery nurse for her care post surgery.  I feel that it is very important to mention everyone. You are magnificent! I wish you all good health and a reduction in your workload very soon, along with an increase in staffing and a future very significant pay rise from the Government!

In those 30 mins in the waiting room there was one person who had no mask at all, one patient not even covering his nose with his mask. I felt really uncomfortable and unsafe. Also feeling dehydrated and ill at this point then to top it all when I asked when will I be going for my procedure, i then got told by a nurse that they were running late and I would have to wait for at least an hour and a half as they were so behind. I was so upset ! Why make appointments for people and ask if they can come earlier, and then be expected to sit in a waiting room with no Covid safe practice going on, I had to leave. How can you expect people to sit there two hours longer after an appointment time with no food or water, which would of been almost 24 hours if I stayed for the procedure. I am going to call my GP tomorrow and ask to go elsewhere for the procedure.

The \"communication\" ended there. I feel cut off and alienated and without a GP to be honest. I guess if the purpose of this system is to put up a barrier between patients and the surgery it really works.

I have now not been given a new appointment, but advised to recontact the department...... on the number that remained unanswered when I tried to contact them last time!","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-03-23T18:27:02.59","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-03-25T11:01:50.78","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lothian","count":4}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/834614","id":"834614"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/834614/responses","id":"834614"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/834614/healthservices","id":"834614"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/834614/tags","id":"834614"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/s308h_320","id":"S308H_320","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/answer%20phone","id":"answer phone"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/echocardiogram","id":"Echocardiogram"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/contactable","id":"contactable"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/836439","id":"836439"}]},{"id":835212,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Not very happy","body":"Unable to get appointments or get phone consultation, even though written to practice manager, when I phone keep being put off they will be ringing me, this is after having to listen to the covic thing every time before being transferred to operator, andthen after pressingnnumber has engaged tone before being cut off.

When I got there having been unable to contact her on the phone she had been on the floor for 5 hours. Within 10 minutes of me contacting the alarm company a team had arrived but could not move her as they suspected a broken hip, and told me to call an ambulance. I did this just before 10pm and the ambulance arrived at 5am. The crew who arrived were great at helping my mum and reassuring her as she was getting sore and agitated due to the time she had been on the floor.  \r\nI would like thank ambulance control who kept in touch with me at regular intervals giving me advice on checking her and speaking to my mum to keep her reassured that they were doing their best. The contact kept both of us feeling calm in a situation that could not be helped. The support was excellent. So thank you. My mum was taken to Glasgow Royal Infirmary and I was told to call A&E in about an hour. I did so and spoke to the Dr.(Chris?) who gave me a great deal of information on her condition and called me back again (despite having finished his shift) to let me know she was going to be seen by the orthopaedic registrar. He duly called me and said she would need an operation. My next call was regarding DNR and the doctor was very honest but sympathetic. I was then called a few hours later by the consultant anaesthetist to let me know she was in recovery and would I like to speak to her. I am amazed and so thankful to all of these people for their contact and support when everything is so difficult. In the space 21 hours in the middle of a pandemic my mum had a new hip! Amazing! I really can't thank you all enough.She then went to Ward 62 and I was called with an update as soon as she arrived and was kept fully informed for the next week before she was transferred to Ward 3A at Gartnavel. Again I was contacted as soon as she arrived. She spent 3 weeks in 3A where she received excellent care that got her back on her feet and home with a full care package.To everyone involved in my mums care in both hospitals, thank you from the bottom of my heart. I wish I knew all of your names so that I could make this more personal.You managed to get a frail 90 year old up and walking and back home in 4 weeks and turned a traumatic experience for both of us into positive one. Everyone I had contact with in both hospitals made me feel reassured and included.My mum is progressing well at home with the support of the home care staff, occupational therapist, physiotherapist, pharmacist and GP. I can't believe the amount of people that have been involved and continue to be involved in her care and the way it has all come together to get where we are.  \r\nOnce again thank you to all of you from both of us. We are so lucky to have all of this available to us on a daily basis. You are all amazing!","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-03-23T19:10:58.9333333","progress":"Story has a

My husband and I were greeted by Sophie, a newly qualified midwife (her first week!) who helped me to a bed space and did my initial assessment. I was much further on than any of us expected (my first labour took over 3 days in total) and things were escalating quickly - I declared I needed to push about 5 minutes after arriving in the triage unit, but Sophie coped brilliantly by getting a more experienced midwife to confirm I needed to get to the midwife led unit ASAP!  \r\nWithin minutes I was through in the MLU, welcomed by another midwife and healthcare support worker (I've forgotten their names but hopefully with dates provided they can be identified) who were absolutely fantastic. They worked really well as a team to encourage and support me, and included my husband in everything. Within 20 minutes of guided pushing our son was safely delivered, and I was immediately given skin to skin and delayed cord clamping as written in my notes. How they had the time to read my notes is beyond me, but it's a shining example of how professional this duo were. They made both my husband and I feel relaxed and safe, and took the time to answer questions and encouraged my husband to also have skin to skin with our baby. I did, unfortunately, suffer a tear that had to be repaired in theatre but this was yet another positive experience in my delivery journey.  \r\nThe entire theatre team I encountered (I was in theatre during the shift change so met both night staff and day staff) were incredible. James, the anaesthetic assistant and Dr Campbell, the anaesthetist, deserve a special mention as they ensured the spinal injection procedure was swift and relatively painless and chatted to me throughout. The rest of the team in theatre (too many names to remember!) were extremely professional and it was evident that they all enjoy their jobs and like working together. It was a lovely, friendly atmosphere and I could not have asked for better care. I received the same high standard of care in recovery, where I was reunited with my husband and son. We were able to have a couple of hours together while I recovered and ate my weight in toast and tea. Again, the recovery staff were brilliant - friendly and supportive, nothing was too much trouble.  \r\nI had to stay overnight in Summerfield ward, and received excellent care there also. I was in a 4 bed room by myself initially, the staff were always popping in to make sure I was ok and would check if I needed anything. They were friendly and approachable, again nothing seemed too much trouble. This was especially welcome given my husband wasn't allowed to stay due to the covid restrictions. I was encouraged during my attempts to breastfeed, and was supported by a fantastic healthcare support worker while I had a breakdown and decided breastfeeding wasn't for me. At no time did anyone make me feel like I was wrong for making this decision, I was given encouragement and assurance that I was doing what was right for me.  \r\nOverall my birth experience at AMH was brilliant, I can't fault a single aspect of the care I received at any point. Every member of staff I encountered was professional, friendly and genuinely seemed to care about the patients and love what they do. My sincere thanks and gratitude to each and every one, you are all a credit to your departments and to the NHS.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-03-23T20:40:22.1533333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-03-25T11:31:45.177","readBy":[{"name":"ACVO TSI","count":1},{"name":"Scottish Government","count":1},{"name":"NHS Grampian","count":10}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/834645","id":"834645"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/834645/responses","id":"834645"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/834645/healthservices","id":"834645"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/834645/tags","id":"834645"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/n161h_501","id":"N161H_501","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/above%20and%20beyond","id":"above and beyond"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anaesthetic","id":"Anaesthetic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/approachable","id":"approachable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/atmosphere","id":"atmosphere"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breastfeeding%20support","id":"Breastfeeding Support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/encouragement","id":"encouragement"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/excellent%20staff","id":"excellent staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/included","id":"included"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/midwives","id":"midwives"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/positive","id":"positive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professionalism","id":"professionalism"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/read%20notes","id":"Read notes"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/safe","id":"safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/spinal","id":"spinal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/team","id":"team"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/teamwork","id":"teamwork"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/triage","id":"triage"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/welcome","id":"welcome"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/relaxed","id":"relaxed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported","id":"supported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thanks","id":"thanks"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/including%20partner","id":"including partner"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/maternity%20theatres","id":"maternity theatres"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/midwife%20led%20unit","id":"midwife led unit"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/835227","id":"835227"}]},{"id":834657,"author":"uniformwg36","authorRoleId":4,"authorRole":"a relative","title":"Care of my mother","body":"My mum was admitted to the Langlands Unit Ward 54 at the Queen Elizabeth hospital for the elderly with a suspected infection.

He was admitted to ward 19a pre and post surgery. The nursing and medical care he received was excellent. This took place during the C19 pandemic, at the end of the 2nd wave, the fact that NHS Lothian were still able to provide this level of healthcare during this very challenging time is exemplary.  \r\nObviously as a family we were not allowed to visit my dad for the duration of his inpatient admission (approx. 3 weeks). As the agreed representative for the family, I would call the ward every day to get an update on his care and treatment. Each time the designated nurse for my dad that day, took the time to take my call, answer my question and provide the information so that I could reassure my dad what was happening ( he got a bit mixed up sometimes) and importantly reassure my mum at home.  \r\nUnfortunately he developed a wound infection and so this delayed his discharge. He was transferred to Ward 18 toward the end of his stay and then discharged, with a follow up appointment at OPD 4, Plastics out patients. He was seen by Emma, the Plastics nurse and she allowed me to come into his appointment so I could keep up to date with his recovery. She was so helpful and just lovely, reassuring my dad and myself. He had however, to be readmitted to ward 18 at that appointment as the infection was increasing again. Again, the care he received there was excellent, at his point of discharge a few days later, the discharge plan was explained to me and he left with a good follow up plan in place.  \r\nHe is now back at home with a wound that is improving every day. On behalf of my family I would like to express our thanks for taking such good care of my dad at a time when we were not able to visit him.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-03-23T22:42:38.6533333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-03-25T13:26:11.19","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lothian","count":7}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/834662","id":"834662"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/834662/responses","id":"834662"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/834662/healthservices","id":"834662"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/834662/tags","id":"834662"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/s308h_100","id":"S308H_100","score":5},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/s308h_300","id":"S308H_300","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/answering%20questions","id":"answering questions"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/excellent","id":"excellent"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good","id":"good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helpful","id":"helpful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/information","id":"information"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lump","id":"lump"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medical%20care","id":"medical care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nursing%20care","id":"nursing care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/operation","id":"operation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/safe","id":"safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wound","id":"wound"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassuring","id":"reassuring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/time%20given","id":"Time given"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/family%20kept%20informed","id":"family kept informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/like%20family","id":"like family"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thanks","id":"thanks"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pandemic","id":"pandemic"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/835285","id":"835285"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/835301","id":"835301"}]},{"id":834661,"author":"fluteqe63","authorRoleId":1,"authorRole":"a carer","title":"End of life care during a global pandemic","body":"Mum was admitted to hospital 23rd Feb 2021.She sadly died on 21st March 2021.

I received my result before I even left the treatment room and went straight home after with no need to stay in recovery.  \r\nAn excellent team I could not fault them in anyway.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-03-24T07:09:44.6333333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-03-25T13:35:11.117","readBy":[{"name":"Royal Cornwall Hospitals NHS Trust","count":6}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/834775","id":"834775"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/834775/responses","id":"834775"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/834775/healthservices","id":"834775"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/834775/tags","id":"834775"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/ref12_301","id":"REF12_301","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/all%20staff","id":"all staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/excellent","id":"excellent"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sedation","id":"sedation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/team","id":"team"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/throat","id":"throat"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing","id":"amazing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20ease","id":"at ease"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/836596","id":"836596"}]},{"id":835244,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Would recommend this place","body":"I have had health problems in the past so I definitely know a good GP when I see one, and I am really sensitive to it.

My GP asked the Crisis Team to get in touch. One of the changes is that my child is soon leaving home, and I am already anticipating how that loss will affect me. I'm not sure why, but I was called selfish by a member of the Crisis Team who rang me, which only added to my distress. I have encouraged my child to be independent and never tried (or wanted) to stop them, so why was I being selfish by admitting to this stranger how much I love my child, that I will miss them, and how I anticipate how much I will struggle to cope? I can only hope that there was some miscommunication, but I was left feeling worse than before I'd been offered 'help'.  \r\nAnother team member arranged to see me in a face to face appointment, and I'm very grateful for that. I have never found it easy talking on the phone and to be given a real appointment shows they value you as they are prepared to give you time. These two members of staff present were very kind, caring, sensitive, understanding and respectful, all of the things missing from the team member who rang me first.  \r\nThings are still very difficult, not helped by being told a few days later by phone that there wasn't much the team could do for me. I had understood from the person who arranged our face to face that they'd be able to support me. But I appreciate that face to face appointment as it made me feel that I was worth bothering with and trying to help, and not just the selfish person I'd been made to feel I was earlier.  \r\nSo, thank you to this member of staff.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-03-24T13:37:36","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-03-25T14:12:03.557","readBy":[{"name":"Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust","count":5}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/834846","id":"834846"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/834846/responses","id":"834846"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/834846/healthservices","id":"834846"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/834846/tags","id":"834846"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rha-crisis-midnotts","id":"rha-crisis-midnotts","score":4},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/encouraged","id":"encouraged"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helped","id":"helped"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/judgemental","id":"judgemental"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kindness","id":"kindness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/misunderstood","id":"misunderstood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/respectful","id":"respectful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sensitivity","id":"sensitivity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/understanding","id":"understanding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/understood","id":"understood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20for","id":"cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hope","id":"Hope"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported","id":"supported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/continued%20support","id":"continued support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/conflicting%20advice","id":"conflicting advice"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/face%20to%20face","id":"face to face"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/835259","id":"835259"}]},{"id":835258,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Great service","body":"We had our first Coronavius shot (Astra Zeneca) in early March and everyone was very friendly, helpful, efficient and super fast.

I am confident that this treatment is going to make a big difference to my health & my life.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-03-24T13:58:54.66","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-03-25T14:36:19.58","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Grampian","count":4},{"name":"Voluntary Action North Lanarkshire","count":1},{"name":"Partnership for Change","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/834863","id":"834863"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/834863/responses","id":"834863"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/834863/healthservices","id":"834863"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/834863/tags","id":"834863"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/n102h-ent-head-neckop","id":"n102h-ent-head-neckop","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/asthma","id":"asthma"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ent","id":"ent"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hayfever","id":"hayfever"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/inhaler","id":"inhaler"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/welcoming","id":"welcoming"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confident","id":"confident"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fantastic","id":"fantastic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pollinex%20injections","id":"pollinex injections"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/838355","id":"838355"}]},{"id":834902,"author":"CMacR","authorRoleId":8,"authorRole":"a staff member posting for a patient/service user","title":"Learning Disability Care in Forth Valley","body":"I am a manager in adult social care services in the Forth Valley area, we look after adults with very complex needs and health complications. Recently a gentleman we support had to be admitted to Forth Valley Royal at probably the worst time, a severe spike in Covid cases, the hospital was at capacity and very much under pressure, (he did not have Covid but was very unwell). The hospital staff were trying their best but with someone who can not eat, drink, bathroom or even ask for help without assistance it was clear this was going to be difficult.  \r\nWe were aware of a Learning Disability Liaison Nurse, Jemma, who became a vital link between us and the hospital. Through Jemma we were able to have staff in the ward 8am-8pm to provide the intense support the gentleman requires with people who understand him and he can trust despite having no verbal or even obvious communication we know him very well.  \r\nThe care was generally very good, the staff were excellent but it is necessary to have someone with a knowledge of learning disabilities to help with complex patients, and to act as a link between care provider and medical staff. We were able to share protocols with Jemma to help staff identify pain and discomfort when we were not there, to describe typical communication and what it might mean.  \r\nThis role should be more widely available in all hospitals and more care providers should know about the vital work that the LD Liaison nurses do.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-03-24T14:19:25.5233333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-03-25T15:17:16.093","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Forth Valley","count":4}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/834902","id":"834902"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/834902/responses","id":"834902"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/834902/healthservices","id":"834902"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/834902/tags","id":"834902"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/forth-valley-royal-ld","id":"forth-valley-royal-ld","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disability","id":"disability"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good","id":"good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/knowledgeable","id":"knowledgeable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/learning%20disability","id":"learning disability"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/understanding","id":"understanding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid","id":"covid"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/836091","id":"836091"}]},{"id":832540,"author":"yar1950","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"accident on Sunday","body":"I had a accident last Sunday and attended the Queen Victoria minor injuries unit to have quite a severe finger cut stitched with eight stitches.  \r\nI would like say how impressed I was with the staff and service provided.

Yes the reception staff do appear to be disgruntled which often manifests as a negative attitude, which for the patient can be upsetting. However, the staff in general are just like the rest of us, frustrated at the system which they have no power to change, unfortunately I feel this can and often does result in a passive aggressive response to the patient’s. I think they are just as frustrated with management who are not running an efficient or patient centric system.The system of booking an appointment is just ridiculously difficult and the pharmacy service is appalling. I wonder if the lack of an alternative medical practice for the patients is the only reason this once highly regarded surgery is oversubscribed, as given an option I’m sure many would choose an alternative practice. I suppose that is where the problem lies, in the notion that because they are so popular in terms of number of patients it is percieved as being successful, yet in terms of patient satisfaction I feel that they are at the bottom of the list. I’ll end on a positive note by saying that yes, there are some excellent medical staff practicing at the surgery and generally the admin and reception team are lovely human beings, who given half the chance could excel in their role if they could work with a system that is woefully outdated and inefficient. Come on Eden Surgery it’s time for investment for the people you employ and the infrastructure that surrounds them.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-03-14T06:26:34.7866667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-03-25T15:20:01.493","readBy":[],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/832021","id":"832021"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/832021/responses","id":"832021"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/832021/healthservices","id":"832021"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/832021/tags","id":"832021"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/f81004","id":"F81004","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frustrated","id":"frustrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appointment%20booking","id":"appointment booking"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/efficiency","id":"efficiency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/impatient","id":"impatient"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/management","id":"management"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medical%20staff","id":"medical staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/patient-centred","id":"patient-centred"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pharmacy","id":"Pharmacy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/systems","id":"systems"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/admin%20staff","id":"admin staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/some%20staff%20attitude","id":"some staff attitude"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/999344","id":"999344"}]},{"id":832918,"author":"Mumzo Wood","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Superb care at The Global Clinic in Norwich","body":"I attended for an MRI scan at The Global Clinic in Norwich this morning.  \r\nI received superb care from start to finish.
