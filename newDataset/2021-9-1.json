They made an appointment for me to see the nurse at the Wycombe Urgent care center that morning. The nurse examined it and suspected it is a case of gout. I was told no treatment could be given for gout without a blood test confirming it's present. She said I'd need to organise a blood test with my GP. I asked if it could by done by urgent care and was told it definitely had to be done via my GP. I did an online request for a blood test with the Marlow Medical Group and a while later got a callback saying that the urgent care center should have organised the blood test and that the Marlow Medical Group can't do a blood test for me until OCTOBER as the NHS is running low on blood test vials!!!!! They also said a blood test for gout is normally 14-21 days after the gout atrack. When I asked why the person said \"that's what I've been told\", I asked if she was medically trained and she said she wasn't, it's a pity the doctor didn't bother to speak to me as they could've explained the reason why the blood test is taken a few weeks later when gout is suspected ( thanks to Google I now know).\nMy toe and foot are still red, swollen and painful and I still don't know if it's gout or an infection within the joint. In a functioning NHS guess if have had a fluid sample from the joint to rule out an infection but it looks like that's not happening.

I have searched for email addresses, contacted the main switch board, and asked my GP- to no avail. \nIf anyone monitors this, please could I have a working phone number to chase my biopsy results??","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2021-09-01T12:25:42","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-09-01T20:58:35","readBy":[{"name":"Barts Health NHS Trust","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/874808","id":"874808"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/874808/responses","id":"874808"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/874808/healthservices","id":"874808"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/874808/tags","id":"874808"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/r1hnh","id":"R1HNH","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/biopsy","id":"biopsy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cancer","id":"cancer"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gynaecology","id":"gynaecology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/test","id":"test"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/875051","id":"875051"}]},{"id":874821,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Awful","body":"Have been phoning weekly since my daughter‚Äôs assessment beginning of July.\nNo follow up, don‚Äôt return your calls as promised & give you the run around.\nZero level of care on their behalf totally let down & disgusted in the none existent care my daughter has received!

I will run out soon which will lead to serious issues for my health.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2021-09-01T15:13:49","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-09-01T21:19:15","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/874842","id":"874842"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/874842/responses","id":"874842"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/874842/healthservices","id":"874842"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/874842/tags","id":"874842"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/e82123","id":"E82123","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ect","id":"ECT"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/terrible","id":"terrible"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/876432","id":"876432"}]},{"id":874843,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Unable to contact ","body":"No notification of delivery received, medication due in 5 days, have had to take a days annual leave today as I have been waiting for over 4 hours today.

Right now you don't even get into the queue - the phone just rings forever then rings off.\n\nI've recently had two sets of tests done - blood tests and CT head scan. Both had results returned to the Practice at the relevant time, but nobody bothered to convey those results to me. I couldn't ring them because of the above problem getting through on the phone. Luckily I live nearby so on both occasions went in to speak to the receptionist who conveyed the results to me in person (in a waiting room full of other people). Nothing particularly embarrassing, both tests all clear, but surely this is not the way it should be!? \n\nAn absence of communication gives patients absolutely no comfort whatsoever. If there's no time or capacity to call just ping a text to confirm a negative test at the very least.\n\nI'm currently wanting to book an appointment to discuss an elective procedure. I can't even book one! It's Wednesday now and I'm told to try calling back on Monday. Why can't the receptionist just schedule an appointment some time in the future?? Why should I need to suffer your phone system again?\n\nI know you have to triage and give more urgent stuff priority, but I am no malingerer and have generally made very little use of the NHS... at least let me book an appointment for some time in the future?\n\nSorry this is so negative. When I get to see people, they're always efficient and helpful, but seeing them is a real trial!","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2021-09-01T15:27:53","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-09-01T21:21:51","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/874841","id":"874841"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/874841/responses","id":"874841"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/874841/healthservices","id":"874841"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/874841/tags","id":"874841"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l81068","id":"L81068","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood","id":"blood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20tests","id":"blood tests"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ct","id":"ct"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/head","id":"head"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scan","id":"scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/test","id":"test"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tests","id":"tests"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/triage","id":"triage"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/878075","id":"878075"}]},{"id":874840,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Thoughtful Principals","body":" Nice condolence letter from the Practice Management on my mother's passing though she'd only been registered with them a few weeks.\n\nThank you\nIan Rattray\n\n \n\n","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2021-09-01T15:28:23","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-09-01T21:21:53","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/874840","id":"874840"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/874840/responses","id":"874840"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/874840/healthservices","id":"874840"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/874840/tags","id":"874840"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/h82028","id":"H82028","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/888055","id":"888055"}]}]
