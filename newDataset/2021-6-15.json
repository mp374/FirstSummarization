Her BM had dropped to 2.1 but Matt (a junior doctor, I’m sure?) worked very quickly to ensure she received the treatments she needed and explained everything that was going on in detail to me and answered any questions I had without making me feel like we were holding him back from other jobs, especially when the department was so busy. We were quickly treated and moved up to the children’s ward and were met by Marianne, and the other nurses (Sorry, I can’t remember the other names!!).  \r\nMarianne chatted away to my daughter and commented on her nail polish, and made her feel at ease the full duration of our stay, but most importantly introduced her to Laura, who she still refers to as the Toy Doctor. I have ulcerative colitis and often spend time in the hospital either for overnight stays or for outpatient appointments, and will be going for a big operation this year and my daughter can find this very distressing and feels the hospital in a negative place but after her experience of having a “sleepover at the hospital” she now realises that the hospital is nothing to worry about and now expects there to be a fantastic Toy Doctor on standby after my op! !  \r\nI am so thankful to all of the staff who cared for her, especially Marianne, because if we ever need the children’s ward again I know that my girls will be in the safest hands. The team are very lucky to have a newly qualified nurse who is so fantastic at making her patients and their families feel relaxed whilst also making sure they have everything they need. We are also extremely thankful for Laura who made her stay more child friendly and ensured that she had access to plenty of activities to keep her busy and distracted from the BM checks!  \r\nSince coming home, she has been telling all of our family and friends how cool the hospital is and how Laura and Marianne, “her doctors”, were so kind to her and how they even looked after all the babies whilst looking after her. She won’t always remember her stay, but her Dad and I will and we are so thankful that it was such a positive experience for us all, despite her being unwell, but we will always remember the outstanding level of care we received. Thank you to everyone who looked after her, and to Dr Pitel for continuing her care after her discharge. We are so lucky to have such an amazing paediatric team close by.

I have been hearing voices that was telling me to hurt someone who was very close to me. I wasn't coping with that. I was acutely suicidal, and I hated myself so much that I thought it was absolutely necessary that I need to kill myself first before I do that to anybody else.  \r\nI was living with my brother at the time who was so worried because of just how distressed I was. Him and my sister in law had to take turns to keep an eye on me 24/7 and they were not coping with the level of distress I was experiencing, they couldn't keep me safe nor other people's safety.  \r\nEventually they took me to A&E, we waited for hours. When we finally saw someone and I told them what I was going through I was told I was making it up. I was accused of lying and just making up symptoms to get away with things. The mental health worker that assessed me explicitly told me that I need to be careful in what I'm saying, and they would report me to the police and I will be arrested because I didn't have anything mentally wrong with me and I will be responsible. Having already feel so horrible about myself due to everything I was experiencing, being told that made things so much worse. At that point I truly believed that I was the problem, that I need to be gone before I do any damage to anybody else and I believed that I just didn't deserve anyone to care and the mental health workers who saw me that night confirmed that.  \r\nMy brother was lost. He was frustrated. They just thrown us out even though under those circumstances I really shouldn't have been allowed to leave A&E whilst I was clearly a risk to myself and to others. I got to a stage asking for help, talking about psychotic experiences that I couldn't understand and I was really distressed of experiencing, then to be told by mental health professionals that I was lying, or being dramatic it is absurd. That experience scarred me, and it means that in the years to come I became much more withdrawn and really struggled with talking about my experiences in the fear of not being believed again.  \r\nFew days later after that attendance at A&E I was sectioned. I attempted suicide. If someone have probably listened and just supported correctly earlier, things probably wouldn't escalate to that point. I could have lost my life. I could have hurt other people. But it was preventable if I was given at least a level of understanding and the right support.","criticality":"strongly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-05-14T11:00:21.5133333","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2021-06-15T09:43:37.93","readBy":[{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2021)","count":2},{"name":"Time to Change - Wales","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/846360","id":"846360"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/846360/responses","id":"846360"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/846360/healthservices","id":"846360"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/846360/tags","id":"846360"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/r1l","id":"R1L","score":1},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fear","id":"fear"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frustrated","id":"frustrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/i%20hated%20it","id":"i hated it"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/neglected","id":"neglected"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20being%20listened%20to","id":"not being listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20listened%20to","id":"not listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20frustrated","id":"very frustrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/worried","id":"worried"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/a&e","id":"a&e"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/accusing","id":"accusing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/distressed","id":"distressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hearing%20voices","id":"hearing voices"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/horrible","id":"horrible"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20believed","id":"not believed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/psychosis","id":"psychosis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/psychotic","id":"psychotic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/schizoaffective%20disorder","id":"schizoaffective disorder"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/schizophrenia","id":"schizophrenia"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sectioned","id":"sectioned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/suicidal","id":"suicidal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/suicide","id":"suicide"}]},{"id":854618,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"left feeling unsure and unsafe","body":"Found the reception staff and nurse to be helpful, concerned & informative.

There are rarely any apppointments available using the app so you have to call in to get an appointment. This is not accepatble. Something has changed to increase the waiting time and the only excuse they have is that more people are suddenly making appointments. This didn't happen throughout the pandemic and now suddenly there has been a surge in pateints?

Over the last few years I have been left with no option but to receive treatment privately due to the lack of treatment and diagnosis from my practice.  \r\nIssue 1.  \r\nI had some serious knee pain following a football injury. On visiting my gp at my local practice I was given pain medication and physio treatment. This knee pain went on all through physio treatment and I was offered nothing more that physio and pain relief. My knee would give in on me, doing basic activities such as walking. It was then I have to take the descision and go private. I was immediately reffered to a specialist who reffered me for an MRI and physio treatment. The MRI showed that I had damage to my miniscus. Surgery was approved and during keyhole surgery they found that my tendon was torn in the centre, therefore my knee was opened up and appropriate surgery was given. If I had not went private I firmly believe I would have been left with irreversible damage, with the impression that only pain relief was the answer. I'm have made a full recovery after surgery.  \r\nIssue 2. I have had ongoing back problems for years after an incident in the forces, and each time I seen a GP I only ever received pain relief. The pain over the years has progressively worsened again I was given pain relief and physio through my GP. This pain has continued to worsen and and due to it being near impossible to get through to my practice over the phone due to their completely insufficient telephone line, I again had to go private. I first tried chiropractic treatment which gave me temporary relief. As it was only temporary and running into the thousands I then reached out to a specialist privately. I again was immediately reffered to a physio and an for an MRI scan. The physio treated me as normal with the inclusion of electro accupuncture. The physio treatment as before did not provide much more progress in my increasing and completely immobilising back pain. The MRI showed signs of a possible historic disk split with scarring and degeneration of the disc, irreversible damage that could have been treated better in the past. I recall on one occasion calling 999 as in one instance I collapsed to the floor in pain and could not move anything other than my arms without nearly passing out in pain. Because I had no symptoms of covid and had a history of back pain, The operator told me to hang up and call nhs 24. I waited 40 min on hold until my battery died at which point I lay on my livingroom floor completely immobilised with no way of getting help. I lay there for 1 hr before I was able to drag myself to a phone charger and call my fiancee. With the results of my MRI I was reffered to a pain specialist and received an epidural. To no effect. I since been back to my GP and again only pain relief was given. 2 days later I was in hospital due to being in so much pain I have been completely immobilised. Again only pain relief was given. In hospital along with co-codamol and a pain patch I had already taken, I was given morphine, naproxen and a tramadol, and relevant tests for possible cauda equina. The tests came back negative and whilst still in substantial pain (slightly more mobile) even with the all the pain treatment given, I was discharged with crutches. I was told by the nurse any other decisions such as possible surgery would have to be a \"discussion to be had with a gp\". I now have to go back to my GP and literally beg for surgery or contact my local MP.  \r\nI am so disgusted and deflated due to the lack of proper diagnosis and treatment available through the NHS. It seems unless it's deemed an emergency, the only answer ever is pain relief and pain management or go private. This is not enough for me. At 34 years old I am in no position to be in this state and still be able to work the rest of my days with ineffective pain relief. Without proper treatment and just masking the issue with pain relief I will no doubt have to take myself out of work half way through my working life, and live in pain taking tablets the rest of my days. I'm a mechanic by trade, and if I was to put this into perspective, it would be like me attending a breakdown where a car has blown its engine and telling them the car is fine but it has be towed the rest of its days.  \r\nPain relief should be a temporary measure until a permanent fix can be found. Not a permanent measure until a permanent fix is too late.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-06-13T12:34:50.3866667","progress":"Story has a

Overall, I had a good experience with the care I received and was grateful to be able to have my partner there at the scan. However, there are a couple of things which made this experience less favorable.  \r\n  \r\nThe parking at QEUH is appalling, I think everyone knows that and I appreciate it is a difficult issue to resolve. We spent at least 20 minutes in search of a space, doing laps through the multi-storey not realising the top 3 levels are for staff only, this could have been more clear. There is a simple way to improve everyone's experience - install vehicle detection sensors. Car parks all over the world use these and it makes it easy to know how many spaces are available even before you go in, it would make everyone's experience with the limited parking so much better. I am already dreading going back for my next appointment due to the parking, what would we do if I was coming to give birth and urgently needed a space?  \r\n  \r\nThe other thing that would have improved my experience drastically is the ability to receive a video of your ultrasound. This is done extremely easily privately, and photos/videos are sent by email, reducing paper use. Why can this not be offered to women with the NHS? I do completely understand the strict instruction not to take any video, but the memory of my baby jumping in my womb is already fading and I so wish I could treasure it more. I know this is not the purpose of the appointment, I completely appreciate it is a health service but if you are able to provide a printed, surely it wouldn't be too difficult to send these by email instead and include a video? And it would save printing/paper resource? I don't imagine my suggestion will go anywhere, but in 5-10 years time I hope things like this will improve.  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n","criticality":"minimally critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-06-14T09:18:50.4533333","progress":"Made change","dateOfPublication":"2021-06-15T10:29:29.51","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":9},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2021)","count":2},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/854224","id":"854224"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/854224/responses","id":"854224"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/854224/healthservices","id":"854224"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/854224/tags","id":"854224"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sj9qe-matop","id":"sj9qe-matop","score":3},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disappointed","id":"disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sad","id":"sad"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/baby","id":"baby"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/car%20parking","id":"car parking"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/maternity","id":"maternity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/memory","id":"memory"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20good","id":"not good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/parking","id":"parking"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scan","id":"scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ultrasound","id":"ultrasound"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/womb","id":"womb"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/personalised","id":"personalised"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/partner%20support","id":"partner support"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/855023","id":"855023"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/856257","id":"856257"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/856566","id":"856566"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/856568","id":"856568"}]},{"id":854634,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Unprofessional, uncaring, unhelpful","body":"Very unprofessional.

But I needn’t have been. I contacted the head of the AMU fairly early on in my pregnancy to discuss my options and I’m so glad I did! The reaction was amazing and I felt really supported and empowered to advocate for myself to help achieve the birth I wanted which made me go into the later stages of my pregnancy feeling very confident.  \r\nIn the end, I had a beautiful VBAC water birth in the alongside midwifery unit surrounded by fairy lights. It was the most incredible and healing experience after my previous traumatic birth. All of the midwifes I met during the birth were so respectful of my wishes to follow my body’s lead and kept their distance, allowing me to birth my baby with next to no intervention or examinations etc.  \r\nTo any ladies who are reading this thinking they would like to try for a VBAC, be honest with your care team and you will be supported to have the kind of birth you want.

I understand that covid is slowing everything down and there is a backlog and there are people in worse situations than this but why is it so slow.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2021-06-11T16:20:56","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2021-06-15T11:52:21","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/854652","id":"854652"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/854652/responses","id":"854652"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/854652/healthservices","id":"854652"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/854652/tags","id":"854652"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/g83037","id":"G83037","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/heart","id":"heart"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid","id":"covid"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%2019","id":"covid 19"}]},{"id":854657,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Not answering phone for 2 hours","body":"I've tried more than a dozen times today [14/06/21] to contact reception between 12:50 and 14:55 including 2 waits of 20 minutes.

So he reached for a second needle and injected my left arm again. While I was sat in my chair a few moments later a nurse of doctor came across and said to the doctor-I saw you put a used needle back in the tray with the full needles-. He replied very hesitantly that that was earlier when he did not have a sharps box, so I used a tray. I did not believe this for one minute as every station had a sharps box and a spare one under the table. I went home in pieces thinking what has this doctor just given me. My best friend is currently dying a slow agonising death with only months to live because of liver disease brougt on by hepatitis. So I fully understand the implications of catching hepatitis or even HIV from a dirty needle.  \r\nI rang my doctors on the following Monday 2 days after my incident and spoke to the practice manager telling her what had gone on and could I have a blood test to make sure I hadn’t caught anything. She said they would treat it as a needle stick incident and arrange a blood test and hepatitis vaccine . I felt a little bit safer knowing things were in place to help protect me.  \r\nThe next day a GP from my practice rang me and I was cast into a whole world of hell. She said they could not do the blood tests and vaccination, I asked her why and she replied. -we can’t do the blood test just like that because it did not happen!”! I said what do you mean it did not happen I was given two needles. She said she could not trace the person that witnessed the doctor put the dirty needle back in with the ready to use ones. I said speak to your practice manager she knows who it was. She said again I could not have a blood test and vaccination as they could not be done for no reason. She said all I could do was have a meeting with the dr concerned. I said I don’t want to see him again as he would be the last person on earth I would want to see and talk to. That’s all we can do she said so I said ok but I am not happy.  \r\nThe following day the practice manager rang me to say the insurance company had been in touch and to put my mind at rest they’d would do the blood test and vaccination.  \r\nI went along to my local sexual health clinic and took my place in the waiting room. My name was called and I went into an exam room with a nurse who’s calming manner instantly put me at ease. She totally understood my concerns and worries and took time to explain about the whole process. She then went on to take my initial blood test asking if I also wanted to be checked for HIV. The thought of George Michael and Freddie Mercury came straight into my head. What if the person whose needle I got had aids as well as hepatitis. A double death sentence.  \r\nShe then gave me my initial vaccination for hepatitis and made my follow up monthly appointments for more vaccine and finally a blood test to see if I had contracted hepatitis or HIV.  \r\nFour weeks later I got summoned to the clinic as my blood test had shown no antibodies to the hepatitis so I would g go ave to have the monthly vaccine shots. So My life was now in the lap of the gods. Hoping the vaccine got into my bloodstream and built up antibodies before anything nasty did.I have another vaccine shot in June then my final blood test to see if I am clear or infected in august.  \r\nI feel like a dirty person and have not kissed or had any sexual relationship with my wife since. I cannot sleep at night as I lie awake thinking what if!!!!!!I find myself crying when I am alone and get suicidal thoughts. Why me I find myself saying, what have I done to deserve thiS. The words -it didn’t happen-reverberate around inside my head. In dec 2019 I had a right leg below knee amputation and because of covid getting a prosthetic was delayed. I finally got my leg but rather than being out there practising I find myself in bed trying to catch up on sleep as I can’t sleep at night anymore. My best friend with 3 or 4 months to live at best is eating away at me to. Thank you cobridge sexual health clinic for all you have done and for being a good listener.  \r\nWhat the outcome will be I do not know","criticality":"strongly

My initial consultation took place in person at the centre which is where I first met my therapist, following this there was a very long wait (a few months) before I was actually offered treatment. I began my treatment in person and was immediately struck by the fact I was struggling to express myself in the sessions due to the therapist constantly talking at me, or interrupting when I was explaining in response to a question. I continued the sessions as I was hopeful that this was just the initial phase of treatment and that I would get more chance to discuss my issues further down the line. This however, was not the case. When the lockdown came into effect my sessions were transferred to a telephone conversation service. At this point the therapist began arriving late to sessions, often between 15-30 minutes after the time our call was scheduled. Some weeks I would be waiting for the call for our appointment and the call would never come. I was never given any explanation or apology for this, they would just turn up to the following week's session as though nothing had occurred.  \r\nOne of the main issues I had was that the therapist didn’t take my opinions into account, particularly concerning my ongoing treatment. I felt I was not ready to be discharged from the service but there was a continual pressure for me to do so. The therapist kept bringing this up in our sessions and eventually texted me to tell me that I was being discharged from the service despite my wishes. In the message it was explained that the reason for this being that there was pressure from management due to an extensive waiting list. I feel this is an unacceptable reason to discharge someone still in need of support.  \r\nOverall I feel the lack of care and poor communication has really affected my experience and that the delivery of this type of service should be monitored more closely. I still feel that I am struggling with issues I really need support with. I would like more therapy with a different practitioner, but have now been discharged from the service and am unsure what my options are.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-06-14T15:41:15.6533333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-06-15T14:55:56.773","readBy":[{"name":"Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust","count":1},{"name":"Time to Change - Wales","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/854319","id":"854319"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/854319/responses","id":"854319"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/854319/healthservices","id":"854319"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/854319/tags","id":"854319"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rhapg","id":"RHAPG","score":1},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lack%20of%20care","id":"Lack of care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/active%20listening","id":"active listening"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/consistency","id":"consistency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disregarded","id":"disregarded"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/eating%20disorder","id":"eating disorder"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/empathy","id":"empathy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/person-centred","id":"person-centred"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/time%20keeping","id":"time keeping"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/understanding","id":"understanding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unsure","id":"unsure"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lost","id":"lost"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/impact%20of%20covid-19","id":"impact of covid-19"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/overall%20service","id":"overall service"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/under%20pressure","id":"under pressure"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/telephone%20sessions","id":"telephone sessions"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/855368","id":"855368"}]},{"id":854598,"author":"Camilla17","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"First vaccine","body":"Everything was smooth, staff was extremely kind, caring and professional.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-06-15T08:13:27.9933333","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2021-06-15T15:01:01.783","readBy":[{"name":"City & Hackney GP Confederation","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/854598","id":"854598"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/854598/responses","id":"854598"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/854598/healthservices","id":"854598"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/854598/tags","id":"854598"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/q71-chconfed-covid19vaccine","id":"q71-chconfed-covid19vaccine","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/caring","id":"caring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kind","id":"kind"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professional","id":"professional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/smooth","id":"smooth"}]},{"id":854599,"author":"MelissaWM","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Covid 19 vaccination","body":"I just want to say thank you so much to all the wonderful staff at the John Scott Vaccination Centre!

We had been seen at A&E on Sunday after speaking to 111 and was given antihistamines, Tuesday mum got worse so we took her to her GP where they told us to immediately come back to A&E for treatment.  \r\nNow A&E staff were excellent and truly cared about my mum however the security staff were horrendous! My mum suffers with anxiety, depression and borderline personality disorder along with other health issues and on the door I explained to security I am mums sole carer and I need to be with her due to her anxiety. They simply said that they know what anxiety looks like and that my mum doesn't have it. After further explaining yes she does they went on to say she will have to \"suck it up\" as I would not be going in with her. With 6 years in healthcare professions I truly understand the reason they are controlling the amount of people in and out of the hospital due to the pandemic. Yet to be told by a secure guard mum doesn't have anxiety and she will have to suck it up was disgraceful, I have spoken to the on call manager that night who explained I should have been allowed in and that it should have been a nurse to make the call if my mum needed me or not. It took an hour and a half of fighting to get inside to be with my mum in that time she had seen a nurse and a doctor but because she was so flustered by the event she had no recollection of this!  \r\nAs it turns out the nurse said I was allowed in the waiting area with mum but not in the triage space due to it being so busy. This was absolutely fine as it allowed me to be there when mum came out to calm her down and ensure she understood what was happening with her care.  \r\nMy mum was admitted that night and I spoke daily with her to ensure she was ok and that she understood things however it added a lot more stress onto an already stressful event. My main takeaway from this is that Treliske currently have security on the doors for a completely viable reason however if you are patient-facing and have the task to decide who can and cannot enter you should have the basic knowledge in mental health disorders to know the true impact you can have with your words.  \r\nIf mum had come home that night I knew she would have needed a lot of emotional support to ensure she didn’t believe the incident to be her fault which may have put her at risk of self harm as a result.  \r\nOne person's words can have dire consequences on an already vulnerable person.  \r\nI will now be personally seeing what my small voice can do to ensure no matter who you are if you are working on hospital grounds and patient-facing that basic mental health knowledge is taught, this goes for all staff from cleaners, security to maintenance!","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-06-14T16:35:30.1666667","progress":"Story has a

I had a medication review and received my prescription on the same day that I had a telephone consultation with the GP. The prescription was sent electronically to my local pharmacy within a matter of minutes.
