I was on the floor for 2 hrs before my son came home. Following A&E I was moved to Oken Ward, and 2 days later I was moved to Victoria Ward and i stayed there for 2 weeks until discharge on 8th Oct 2020. I would like to thank the doctors and nurses, and support services, on Oken Ward, and in particular, Victoria Ward. I was on strong iv antibiotics throughout my stay to get things back to normal. Unfortunately I still couldn't go home because INR and sodium levels were low. I have been well looked after on VictoriaWard, the nurses do not stop. They are constantly on the go, but they are committed and dedicated, and always act in a professional way in order to give me the best care I can get in order I can go home. It has been a pleasure to have been treated by such caring individuals and I am in no doubt that this has helped me get back on my feet in as quick a time as possible. Physio therapists helped me to take small steps to start with and helped me to be able to walk the corridor that runs through the ward. I can honestly say that Victoria Ward has been the best ward that i have been an in-patient on. Over the years I've been on several wards although I'm not particularly elderley. In addition, the catering |I have found to be extremely good. I particularly liked the macaroni cheese, and the soups.  The porridge is also excellent. So no complaints from me on that score. \nIn conclusion, I am so happy that Warwick Hospital is my local hospital. An excellent hospital with excellent staff.\nThumbs up to South Warwickshire Hospital Trust..\n\nThank you.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-10-09T16:37:40","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-10-10T11:47:07","readBy":[{"name":"South Warwickshire NHS Foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/794155","id":"794155"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/794155/responses","id":"794155"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/794155/healthservices","id":"794155"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/794155/tags","id":"794155"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rjc02","id":"RJC02","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/antibiotics","id":"antibiotics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/arthritis","id":"arthritis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/feet","id":"feet"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good","id":"good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helped","id":"helped"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/inr","id":"INR"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/iv%20antibiotics","id":"iv antibiotics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/joint","id":"joint"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/normal","id":"normal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/physio","id":"physio"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/rheumatoid","id":"rheumatoid"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/rheumatoid%20arthritis","id":"Rheumatoid arthritis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/well%20looked%20after","id":"well looked after"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happy","id":"happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/797380","id":"797380"}]},{"id":794154,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"fantastic staff and care","body":"Thanks to all staff on ward 14 had my op 8th Oct 2020 all staff are brilliant from start to finish  everybody his kind and helpful thanks now home and resting thanks againBeryl Wilson x","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-10-09T16:39:40","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-10-10T11:47:33","readBy":[{"name":"Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS Trust","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/794154","id":"794154"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/794154/responses","id":"794154"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/794154/healthservices","id":"794154"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/794154/tags","id":"794154"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rw601","id":"RW601","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/brilliant","id":"brilliant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thanks","id":"thanks"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/795748","id":"795748"}]},{"id":794156,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Not very understanding","body":"Receptionist very unhelpfull when told she was being unreasonable told if I raised my voice would be cut off","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-10-09T16:43:52","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2020-10-10T11:48:11","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/794156","id":"794156"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/794156/responses","id":"794156"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/794156/healthservices","id":"794156"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/794156/tags","id":"794156"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l82030","id":"L82030","score":null}]},{"id":794158,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Jewel in the Crown","body":"Excellent practice, professional and caring, never had wait a long time to see a doctor or nurse.

Staff could see us standing outside the door yet noone came an offered help. Noone responded even when knocking. Someone then knocked continuously after standing there for a while with no response when one reception member finally came out. Not to help though! To shout for knocking so much. Had they been helpful and responded people would not feel the need to knock that much. They wouldn't have had to wait for ages for help. Why be in a patient facing role if you have no customer service skills or basic levels of patient care. Working in the NHS one of the main things we should be is caring towards patients. Your staff were not. I believe you should rethink your patient facing staff and offer them more training in how to care about patients more. To be waiting for ages without no acknowledgement or help is not expected from someone dealing with patients at all. There was also no patience or understanding. No help. Just shouted at for knocking. No sorry how can we help. No how can we help. Just shouted at for knocking.

I had ordered my meds via a chemist on Wednesday afternoon this week, so in theory I should have received my meds on Friday, ready to be picked up at the chemist. However, my meds were not at the chemist at 5.30pm.  So I contacted the receptionist, after explaining, I was told the prescription is not signed, even though 48hrs notice was provided.  I asked her if she could try and sort the prescription for me as the GP has look at it and send it via EPS as I have none left, but she cut me off and said \"No, usually you have to give us 48hrs notice\". She further stated, my prescription will not be ready until Monday.  I tried explaining a notice was served. In reply she said she can't  do anything  about it. She did not display any courtesy or understand of my needs! I now am left without any meds for the weekend.  I am very concerned and worried the decision the receptionists are allowed  to make without consulting the clinicians.  \n\nI understand the pressure the GPs and their staff are under at present time, but even though going by the rules of 48hrs notice, I still did not get my medication.  I find this appalling service and dangerous practice for those patients who may live on medications. \n\nI hope the practice remind their staff of their duties of listening, being helpful, caring and understanding.

You have to work out who you should be asking to see - normally a doctor but sometimes not - and then navigate your way through loads of questions including stuff like “do you want a telephone appointment or face to face”. The only correct answer of course is “I don’t know, you’re the doctors not me”.  But there isn’t a field for that. \n\nIf you do get through all this - and I bet many vulnerable or elderly people don’t - you then get offered a consultation by phone or face to face. In this case it was face to face. \n\nI arrived on time but the medical professional was running late. Nobody told me that - under the old system they would have. Eventually I was seen and the individual appeared to me to be extremely professional. She asked all the questions I would have expected, examined me (both wearing masks) and I think she correctly identified the problem. She has prescribed me exercises which appear to be working. She also wants me to see a physio, but no one has been in touch about this, so I’m not sure what to do about it. \n\nThe other thing that is bizarre about this practice’s IT system is that you often get text messages from doctors, but there is no means of replying. So you are left wondering what to do, and often end up starting the system over again and making an appointment, when all you needed was an exchange of text messages to resolve the issue. Seems a waste of scarce NHS resources.

Both of the the paramedics were friendly, kind and caring and were great at reassuring us in what was a very anxious situation. It was decided it would be too distressing for my son to be taken by ambulance to hospital but I was provided with the paperwork I would need as well as being reassured that if anything were to happen on my way to hospital, an ambulance would be available to help if need be. \n\nWhen arriving at Pilgrim A&E we were dealt with by a lovely, friendly receptionist. \nWe were quickly seen and taken through to a cubicle for my little boy to be assessed and have tests. Each nurse and doctor encountered during this were fantastic - they were friendly and caring towards both my son and I, and I felt very confident in what they were doing to help my son. \nWhilst waiting to be taken up to the children’s ward, one of the paramedics that had assisted us earlier popped in to see my son to check how he was doing which was a lovely surprise and I thank him for being so thoughtful and as before he was very kind and reassuring. \n\nWe were taken to to the children’s ward and ended up having to stay in overnight as my son needed oxygen. \nAs with all the previous staff members I had met, the nurses and doctors on the children’s ward were all wonderful as were the lovely ladies who brought us drinks and cleaned our room. \nI am honestly so so grateful to all of the team for not only making my son better, but for being so lovely to us throughout. It made what was a tough situation much easier to deal with. \nEven little things like bringing me a phone charger, and a compact DVD player with my son’s favourite film were so helpful and meant so much. \n\nI cannot thank the staff enough - they were the loveliest paramedics, nurses, doctors & housekeeping staff I have ever encountered in a hospital. \n\nThank you once again, you are all brilliant and are very much appreciated!
