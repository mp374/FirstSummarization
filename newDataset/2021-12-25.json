Since Clover took over the surgery I've noticed a massive change in the staff. It seems like out with the old and in with the new. The staff are nice but not recognising some of the staff is a bit disturbing because I don't cope very well with changes due to having depression and borderline personality disorder.  \r\nTo make things worse I phoned the doctors up for a appointment what I knew would be a telephone call appointment which is not a problem. I'm okay with the receptionist asking me what I'm wanting help with. What I'm not happy with is the new telephone system which is automated, saying that all calls will be recorded for training and monitoring. That is so wrong and feels very intrusive that I am been recorded without my permission.  \r\nI also find it hard to trust people that's why I only like talking to the same doctors who have known me for years. I have always been able to talk to my GP about anything even if it's very personal, knowing it would be kept confidential. Sometimes I've been asked if I don't mind having a medical student sit in doing training that was also fine, or I would be asked if I would like to fill in a questionnaire form about my experience. That is also was fine because I was able to have the choice to say yes or no.  \r\nNow that I know that I'm being recorded I have found it very intrusive and upsetting. I also feel paranoid that when the recordings are been listed to that I'm going to be laughed at because of my mental health issues. I sort of understand that the recordings are for the benefit of the patients and staff,but for a few days after my telephone conversation my depression got worse because of the recordings.  \r\nLike the saying goes if it isn't broken don't try and fix it.  \r\nI think the old way the surgery was run was the best way.","criticality":"minimally critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-12-22T17:09:40.1366667","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2021-12-26T12:20:00.65","readBy":[{"name":"Ulster University, MBBS (Medicine) 2021","count":1},{"name":"Heeley Green Surgery","count":1},{"name":"Healthwatch Sheffield","count":1},{"name":"NHS Sheffield ICB","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/904907","id":"904907"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/904907/responses","id":"904907"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/904907/healthservices","id":"904907"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/904907/tags","id":"904907"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/c88073","id":"C88073","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/borderline%20personality%20disorder","id":"Borderline Personality Disorder"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/depression","id":"depression"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/impersonal%20care","id":"impersonal care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/the%20change","id":"the change"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/telephone%20appointments","id":"telephone appointments"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gps","id":"gps"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/automated%20system","id":"automated system"}]},{"id":905245,"author":"gardengnome","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"bowel cancer from diagnoses to outcome.","body":"After being diagnosed with bowel cancer I was treated in a wonderful and timely way by the staff at Inverclyde Royal Hospital (IRH).

Thank you so much for care despite the immense pressures.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-12-24T15:19:44.2766667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-12-26T17:32:38.16","readBy":[{"name":"South Eastern Health and Social Care Trust","count":4}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/905256","id":"905256"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/905256/responses","id":"905256"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/905256/healthservices","id":"905256"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/905256/tags","id":"905256"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt004_07021_180","id":"ZT004_07021_180","score":4},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kindness","id":"kindness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurse","id":"nurse"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vomiting","id":"vomiting"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%2019","id":"covid 19"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/905312","id":"905312"}]},{"id":905265,"author":"Quinng","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Thank you all","body":"I went in to Ward 5 as a day case for a Cardioversion.

She also took the time to ask me how I was coping and to help me out as well. In cx addition she chased up his haematology appointment and called me very soon after she left to let me know when my dad's appointment would be and planned to call me later that day for an update.  \r\nThe GP really put me and my dad at ease today.

I had a propess put in place at 5.30pm on the Friday evening by a lovely midwife. Overnight, I was cared for by by someone else. They were outstanding, but for me this is when issues started. There is a single midwife assigned to a full ward; which quite frankly is not fit for purpose. I had to have the propess removed due to hyperstimulation and Heather was rushed off her feet, as it seemed as if every other person was going into labour and wheeled off the ward.  \r\nI got no sleep and was pretty stressed by the environment itself. I was not aware at any stage that I could be in the induction ward for up to 48 hours; I would have refused this if I had known beforehand. A curtain separates you from the person beside you. It is noisy from others screaming in pain and vomiting. Partner visiting is very limited. Once my last midwife was off duty, I had the most surly, uninterested and uncompassionate midwife take charge of the ward. My propess was reinserted in the early hours and subsequently fell down the toilet.  \r\nI felt like a bother to them from that point on and routinely ignored. I spent most of Saturday afternoon in tears, asking if I could go home, as I wasn’t making progress and not getting anywhere near the labour ward. Another midwife was sent in to speak to me who also did nothing to alleviate my concerns, if anything they made me more anxious, as they kept telling me to think about my baby, with no regard for my own mental or physical wellbeing.  \r\nI waited until the nightshift came on and asked to go home again. At this point another midwife called the sister, who spoke to me and calmed me down. She was the first person who showed me any sort of compassion and didn’t treat me like a nuisance . I got moved to the labour ward within a couple of hours. If it wasn’t for them, I think I’d have been left there stressed to the hilt for a few days.  \r\nThe team on the labour ward did an outstanding job, they looked after me and were absolutely fantastic. organised my epidural with the doctor, and I was comfortable throughout. I laboured until 10cm dilated and pushed for an hour and half, when it was discovered that my son was back to back (they had came back to me from the previous evening and for that I was grateful). I was prepped for theatre for a vacuum delivery.  \r\nThis was attempted the maximum 4 times, before switching to an emergency section. As I had been dilated and my son was deeply engaged, this was a hard section. The team did everything to deliver my son safely, but I’m still in shock about how things turned out. I genuinely felt like my son and I were dying and I lost 1200ml of blood.  \r\nI was moved to the maternity ward and then to a side room, as my son developed jaundice and had to spend a night in the neonatal unit under lamps. They on the maternity also did a brilliant job of looking after me despite being stretched so thinly. Again, the neonatal team did a great job of reassuring me and looking after my son.  \r\nFor those who think the NHS is in danger of being overwhelmed; maternity in the Ulster Hospital already is. The staff work flat out without breaks, and in my opinion, the induction ward puts women’s and children’s safety at risk due to current staffing levels and constraints from Covid. I know of other people who have had similar experiences to me who were induced recently. One of the midwives told me that number of sections is through the roof at the minute. I wonder how many of those people have been induced. I have been offered a debrief with the consultants which I plan to attend, but after my experience, and I know everyone says this, but I genuinely would not put myself through this again. In hindsight, if I could have had an elective section as opposed to an induction, I feel that the outcome might have been better for son and for myself.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-12-26T16:31:29.9766667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-12-27T09:20:01.94","readBy":[{"name":"South Eastern Health and Social Care Trust","count":5},{"name":"Ulster University, MBBS (Medicine) 2021","count":2},{"name":"Public Health Agency","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/905289","id":"905289"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/905289/responses","id":"905289"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/905289/healthservices","id":"905289"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/905289/tags","id":"905289"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt004_07021_501","id":"ZT004_07021_501","score":4},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt004_07021-labour","id":"zt004_07021-labour","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scared","id":"scared"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/delivery","id":"delivery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency","id":"emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/induction","id":"induction"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/jaundice","id":"jaundice"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/labour","id":"labour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/labour%20ward","id":"Labour ward"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/maternity","id":"maternity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/maternity%20ward","id":"Maternity ward"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/midwives","id":"midwives"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/neonatal","id":"neonatal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/patient%20safety","id":"patient safety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pregnancy","id":"pregnancy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/uninterested","id":"uninterested"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vacuum%20delivery","id":"Vacuum delivery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassion","id":"compassion"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/induction%20ward","id":"induction ward"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/informed%20decisions","id":"informed decisions"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/caesarean%20section","id":"caesarean section"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/905338","id":"905338"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/906112","id":"906112"}]},{"id":905313,"author":"Talinos","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Fantastic staff","body":"Had an appointment on Christmas Eve with Mr Mohanty.  \r\nI was very apprehensive as I knew is would cause me some short lived pain.  \r\nFrom entering the department, all the staff I came into contact with were lovely.

Unbelievably there were neither valves nor trained personnel available in his own health board for another 3 weeks taking us into another month and another year.  \r\nI was desperate for my father to be “fixed” and was prepared to travel as far as Newcastle to make this happen. The local health board then managed to arrange an emergency appointment at Monklands. Joyce called me to discuss Dad’s issues, answered all my questions of which there were many! She was so lovely in her manner and empathetic too, explained Francine would be on ward 9 to treat Dad… the contrast could not have been more marked.  \r\nThey had the equipment and the trained personnel. The staff were absolutely lovely and whilst we waited friendly Francine came out to introduce herself and she explained she was being asked to help with another issue but informed us that Mel would be seeing Dad. Dad was very impressed with Mel, said she was caring, efficient and competent.  \r\nOn Christmas Eve, Joyce called me to see how Dad was... I was so touched by this, I can’t thank Joyce enough and hope NHS Lanarkshire realises how lucky they are to have a staff member like her. She is a total asset to the NHS and should be recognised accordingly .  \r\nWe are overwhelmed with the service and felt compelled to tell you. It has restored our faith in our amazing health service.  \r\nI hope my local health board can learn some of the excellent practices your ENT have embedded. Joyce, Francine and Mel, thank you so much.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-12-24T13:32:34.97","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-12-27T10:46:30.803","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lanarkshire","count":3}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/905246","id":"905246"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/905246/responses","id":"905246"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/905246/healthservices","id":"905246"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/905246/tags","id":"905246"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l106h_120","id":"L106H_120","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency","id":"emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/knowledge","id":"knowledge"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/the%20service","id":"The service"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/throat","id":"throat"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tracheostomy","id":"tracheostomy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/valve","id":"valve"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20caring","id":"Very Caring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/empathetic","id":"empathetic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/an%20asset","id":"an asset"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/905436","id":"905436"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/905466","id":"905466"}]},{"id":905314,"author":"Middleage21","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Effective triage","body":"Very effective triage and clinical assessment - reassured and provided with treatment - seen face to face and given thorough assessment.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-12-27T10:02:15.4866667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-12-27T10:47:58.737","readBy":[{"name":"NHS 24","count":24},{"name":"NHS Ayrshire & Arran","count":5}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/905314","id":"905314"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/905314/responses","id":"905314"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/905314/healthservices","id":"905314"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/905314/tags","id":"905314"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/a111h-ayrshire-doctors-on-call","id":"A111H-ayrshire-doctors-on-call","score":5},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/nhs24","id":"NHS24","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/assessment","id":"assessment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/clinical%20staff","id":"Clinical staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/effective","id":"effective"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/triage","id":"triage"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thorough%20assessment","id":"thorough assessment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care%20and%20compassion","id":"care and compassion"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/face%20to%20face","id":"face to face"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/905330","id":"905330"}]},{"id":905311,"author":"Dwcare","authorRoleId":2,"authorRole":"a friend","title":"The care of my partner and myself received at New Cross hospital December 2021","body":"My partner (David) become ill quiet suddenly.

The ambulance appeared very quickly with two efficient and caring medics. The treatment happened quickly, however their biggest problem was trying to calm down my wife, which they did with a smile on their faces.  \r\nI quickly found myself in Hairmyers hospital where I became the star in a scene from casualty. Surrounded by masked faces, an angioplasty was fitted and I was placed on a ward. I was scared and concerned that my wife would have no idea what was going on. Both of these problems were dealt with by a nurse called Andrew, who told me what had happened and what was going to happen. He also made that all important call to my wife. The next day, a team of nursing staff (led by a head angel) took over, who once again kept me informed and comfortable. I was about to be transferred to Wishaw, when I had an accident with a urine bottle. I was totally devastated and embarrassed by this. The nurse in charge gave me the best team talk I have had outside any rugby dressing room and sorted the problem with the minimum of fuss. On transfer to Wishaw General, I was placed under the care of nurse Gayle. Very quickly, she had me comfortable and safe. Because of the care of the nurses and Dr, I managed to get home. I am so grateful and thankful not only for you saving my life but treating me with dignity and respect. I think the NHS continues to be the best healthcare system in the world and this is for one reason only - the magnificent staff. Thank you for giving me my life back.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-12-27T11:31:59.3766667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-12-27T12:37:45.803","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lanarkshire","count":13},{"name":"Scottish Ambulance Service","count":12},{"name":"Partnership for Change","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/905319","id":"905319"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/905319/responses","id":"905319"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/905319/healthservices","id":"905319"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/905319/tags","id":"905319"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l302h-cardiac-catherterisation","id":"L302H-Cardiac-Catherterisation","score":5},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l308h_320","id":"L308H_320","score":5},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/scot-ambulance-emergency","id":"scot-ambulance-emergency","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/embarrassed","id":"embarrassed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frightened","id":"frightened"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scared","id":"scared"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/angel","id":"angel"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/angioplasty","id":"Angioplasty"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/caring","id":"caring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/concerned","id":"concerned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/devastated","id":"devastated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctor","id":"doctor"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/efficient","id":"efficient"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/family%20support","id":"family support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/heart","id":"heart"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/heart%20attack","id":"heart attack"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/informed","id":"informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurse","id":"nurse"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nursing%20staff","id":"nursing staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/respect","id":"respect"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/safe","id":"safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/calm","id":"calm"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dignity","id":"Dignity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/smiles","id":"smiles"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thankful","id":"Thankful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20grateful","id":"very grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/life%20saving","id":"life saving"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/no%20fuss","id":"no fuss"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medics","id":"medics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/explanations","id":"explanations"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/calming%20staff","id":"calming staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20safe","id":"very safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/comfortable","id":"comfortable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20quick","id":"very quick"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/magnificent","id":"magnificent"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/906029","id":"906029"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/906123","id":"906123"}]},{"id":905325,"author":"confederate frank","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"covid jab","body":"I went for jab at the Marks & Spencer building.

I do understand that I will not have the same consultant every day, but I feel that I keep having to explain myself to every consultant and I can never move forward, as the following day someone new would be in.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-12-27T13:18:04.59","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-12-27T14:36:14.887","readBy":[{"name":"Southern Health and Social Care Trust","count":5}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/905324","id":"905324"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/905324/responses","id":"905324"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/905324/healthservices","id":"905324"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/905324/tags","id":"905324"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_32024-s-medical","id":"ZT003_32024-s-medical","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frustrated","id":"frustrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood","id":"blood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cleanliness","id":"cleanliness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/clotting","id":"clotting"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/continuity","id":"continuity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dietician","id":"Dietician"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctors","id":"doctors"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helpful","id":"helpful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/jaundice","id":"jaundice"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/meal%20times","id":"meal times"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/meals","id":"meals"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/progress","id":"Progress"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/safe","id":"safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/repeating%20details","id":"repeating details"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/new%20consultant","id":"new consultant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/spotless%20ward","id":"spotless ward"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20safe","id":"very safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%2019","id":"covid 19"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/906796","id":"906796"}]},{"id":905326,"author":"Katee95","authorRoleId":8,"authorRole":"a staff member posting for a patient/service user","title":"Brilliant care","body":"I was brought into the hospital 5 days ago with a shortness of breath.

We can't thank the staff enough for their continued support and care- particularly Roisin and Doctor Thompson (who always provides a good laugh). There are just little things that would make this ongoing situation a lot better. Firstly, it is only a small thing, but it can be very daunting seeing the variety of colours of uniform- you don't know whether it is a physio, a dietician etc. It would make things a lot easier if there was a small laminated chart somewhere in the room to show the different colours of uniform and the corresponding job- for families like us who need to be aware of the different roles. Due to PPE at the moment (which is very much necessary), you can't see the name tag or role! Another small thing, is that there is no hanging space whatsoever, unideal when you are staying for long periods of time.  \r\nThe major problem I would say is the parking situation- which is atrocious. We generally have to stay in the hospital for days/weeks at a time... and we are expected to pay a parking fee! This is totally unfair as other hospitals in NI have a service which enables parents who are in with a terminally ill child to have free parking. Not only this, but you are expected to pay in cash which exacerbates the situation. Due to our digitally active world nowadays, everything is done through a contactless payment with our phone or card- rarely anyone has cash. As we generally leave the hospital at night time, there is no one at a service desk to open it for us if we don't have change at hand. Instead, we end up having to walk all the way into the building to take money from the ATM in A+E. We then have to buy something small in the shop to break down the money into smaller coins. This would be only an annoyance if you were a visitor, however, after a long day with an ill child, this should be the last thing we should have to worry about. There should be something implemented for free parking as a parent or at least a contactless service!!!","criticality":"minimally critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-12-27T14:36:27.62","progress":"Made change","dateOfPublication":"2021-12-27T15:40:58.81","readBy":[{"name":"Southern Health and Social Care Trust","count":16},{"name":"Public Health Agency","count":2},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2022)","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/905333","id":"905333"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/905333/responses","id":"905333"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/905333/healthservices","id":"905333"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/905333/tags","id":"905333"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_32024_420","id":"ZT003_32024_420","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/annoyed","id":"annoyed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cleanliness","id":"cleanliness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctors","id":"doctors"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/parking","id":"parking"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/terminal%20illness","id":"terminal illness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happy%20with%20care","id":"happy with care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hanging%20space","id":"hanging space"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/colour%20code%20for%20roles","id":"colour code for roles"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/905457","id":"905457"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/908607","id":"908607"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/918539","id":"918539"}]},{"id":905334,"author":"Katee95","authorRoleId":8,"authorRole":"a staff member posting for a patient/service user","title":"I don't feel safe in terms of covid","body":"I arrived on ward 1 North 9 days ago.

I come from a family of five siblings and myself six in total all of whom are grown and have families of our own. Regardless of our ages it was tough on us all. My father had been in and out or Hairmyres for the last four years. We laughed and teased him and would say Dad you have a loyalty card; he was renowned for his famous watch face containing a wedding picture of Mum in Dad in 1954. I believe every member of staff had seen it and remembered him by it.  \r\nThe reason for my writing this letter is to bring to your attention the great care, attention to detail, medical and emotional care & support supplied by the staff of Ward five. It was long haul for us all and after almost four weeks of treatment, going on to comfort him and then eventually end of life care. My Dad made such an impression on the staff and them to him. He gave them nicknames and they would laugh. He was clever right until the end and the staff stated themselves that he will be well remembered. They would kiss his forehead and say sleep well and, in the morning, he would be back up shaving. They were astounded by his fight. Obviously, the calm before the storm.  \r\nThanks to all staff in ward five. We would especially like to mention staff Nurse Lynsey, auxiliary Sharon and Judith, plus Jim Staff Nurse and Nadine final year student and Margarine as Dad called her. She was fond of Dad.  \r\nI feel so badly for the negative press the NHS receives and especially the wait times, hence my letter. On no occasion did my dad wait any longer than 30 minutes for an Ambulance or out of hours doctor or care team to arrive, despite the very trying times and the Pandemic.  \r\nSo just to have it well noted as I know you personally do First Minister, we are one happy family. We have lost our dad but could not have asked for any better treatment and care in his final weeks, days, and hours. Thank you all sincerely forever grateful to the NHS.  \r\n[Very happy with 'Reception']  \r\n  \r\n[Very happy with 'Appointments']  \r\n  \r\n[Very happy with 'Environment']  \r\n.  \r\n[Very happy with 'Staff skills']  \r\n  \r\n[Very happy with 'Staff attitude']  \r\n  \r\n[Very happy with 'Team work']  \r\n  \r\n[Very happy with 'Daily living support']  \r\n","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-12-28T22:34:44.1","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-12-29T11:17:47.97","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lanarkshire","count":6},{"name":"Scottish Government","count":1},{"name":"North Lanarkshire Health & Social Care Partnership","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/905410","id":"905410"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/905410/responses","id":"905410"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/905410/healthservices","id":"905410"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/905410/tags","id":"905410"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l302h_100","id":"L302H_100","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/aspiration","id":"Aspiration"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/attention%20to%20detail","id":"attention to detail"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/auxiliary%20staff","id":"auxiliary staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/comforting","id":"comforting"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emotional%20support","id":"emotional support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/end%20of%20life","id":"end of life"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/expertise","id":"expertise"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medical%20care","id":"medical care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurse","id":"nurse"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pneumonia","id":"pneumonia"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ward%20staff","id":"ward staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/calm","id":"calm"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/great%20care","id":"Great care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pandemic","id":"pandemic"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/905461","id":"905461"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/905480","id":"905480"}]},{"id":905411,"author":"bus man","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Wonderful vaccination service","body":"I would like to to thank all the staff at M & S vaccination center for their wonderful work","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-12-28T22:39:55.4366667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-12-29T11:20:13.293","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Fife","count":4}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/905411","id":"905411"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/905411/responses","id":"905411"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/905411/healthservices","id":"905411"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/905411/tags","id":"905411"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sf9-covidvacs","id":"Sf9-covidvacs","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/all%20staff","id":"all staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good","id":"good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vaccination","id":"vaccination"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid-19","id":"covid-19"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/905475","id":"905475"}]},{"id":905412,"author":"Keen19","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Exemplary care for my child","body":"Words can not explain how professional and reassuring the nurses and staff are at Royal Hospital Belfast for sick kids.

They deserve so much more than than anyone could ever give them.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-12-28T23:14:10.6033333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-12-29T11:25:40.507","readBy":[{"name":"Belfast Health and Social Care Trust","count":11}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/905412","id":"905412"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/905412/responses","id":"905412"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/905412/healthservices","id":"905412"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/905412/tags","id":"905412"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt001_11023","id":"ZT001_11023","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt001-ed","id":"zt001-ed","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/accident%20&%20emergency","id":"accident & emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/all%20staff","id":"all staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breathing%20difficulties","id":"breathing difficulties"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/children's%20a&e","id":"Children's A&E"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/childrens%20ward","id":"childrens ward"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/efficient","id":"efficient"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency%20care","id":"emergency care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/excellent%20care","id":"excellent care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kind","id":"kind"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professional","id":"professional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassuring","id":"reassuring"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/905880","id":"905880"}]},{"id":905413,"author":"Elizabeth21","authorRoleId":4,"authorRole":"a relative","title":"Lack of empathy from out of hours GP","body":"My family arranged for an out of hours GP to visit my mum. She has been very unwell, frail, has dementia and had a fall and has been weak since Friday 24th Dec. I was with mum when the doctor arrived. He was abrupt, lacking compassion, empathy and sensitivity. He introduced himself and asked what's the problem. As my mum was so frail and confused, I explained the situation on her behalf.  \r\nHe went on to start examining mum and without saying what he was going to do, pulled the quilt down from her wee chest and started to listen to her heart. He also pulled her nightdress up to examine her tummy which was absolutely necessary, but he had a total lack of tact about it.  \r\nI'm so saddened as my mum is a gentle, caring, loving wee person and she looked scared, as she didn't get any reassurance at all from the visiting doctor. As her daughter, I felt so disappointed to see my mum treated without the sensitivity she (and every patient) deserves. I work for the NHS and have done for over 20 years and I cannot understand why some staff appear to have such an appalling bedside manner.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-12-28T23:38:56.4233333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-12-29T11:35:42.213","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":6},{"name":"Partnership for Change","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/905413","id":"905413"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/905413/responses","id":"905413"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/905413/healthservices","id":"905413"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/905413/tags","id":"905413"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sj9-general-practices","id":"sj9-general-practices","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxious","id":"anxious"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bedside%20manner","id":"bedside manner"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20pressure","id":"blood pressure"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dementia","id":"dementia"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctor%20empathy","id":"doctor empathy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/out%20of%20hours","id":"out of hours"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/prompt%20service","id":"prompt service"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sensitivity","id":"sensitivity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/uncertain","id":"uncertain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20disappointed","id":"very disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20patience","id":"staff patience"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care%20compassion","id":"care compassion"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/905464","id":"905464"}]},{"id":905414,"author":"LetItSnow","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Long wait for prescription","body":"I called the Western Urgent Care receptionist on Sunday evening and gave my details, the issue and requested the appropriate medication I required.

I rang the receptionist shortly after this to check if someone had tried to get in touch. I was advised that because I had missed the call it had been closed and that I would have to start again from scratch (I wonder if my original call could have been reopened so that I would not have had to go to the bottom of the list or if this is something that could be changed going forward?).  \r\nThe receptionist logged a new call and I gave the same details as before. I was told it could take up to 5 hours to receive a call back. I received a call 8 hours later from a Triage Nurse who advised me to go to A&E, Altnagelvin. I advised her that I only required medication (as I have had this issue before) and that this was not something that required a trip to A&E. I was then told I would be contacted by a Clinician which could take up to 5 hours.  \r\nI received a call 17 hours later on Tuesday to say that I had been left a prescription in the Western Urgent Care Limavady centre which is twice the distance away from my nearest centre in Altnagelvin (I wonder if prescriptions could be picked up from your nearest centre if possible or if this is something that could be changed going forward?). Over 40 hours later and I finally have my medication.  \r\nI would like to thank John in the Western Urgent Care Limavady centre who kindly gave me directions on where to pick up my prescription and advised which chemists were open.

I have eventually been admitted and receiving great care, it was just the initial wait that I am unhappy with.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-12-29T11:57:41.8066667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-12-29T12:43:53.31","readBy":[{"name":"Southern Health and Social Care Trust","count":8}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/905465","id":"905465"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/905465/responses","id":"905465"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/905465/healthservices","id":"905465"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/905465/tags","id":"905465"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_32024_180","id":"ZT003_32024_180","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/accident%20&%20emergency","id":"accident & emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ill","id":"ill"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/overlooked","id":"overlooked"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/triage","id":"triage"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/uncertain","id":"uncertain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wait%20time","id":"wait time"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/spoken%20over","id":"spoken over"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/907151","id":"907151"}]},{"id":905467,"author":"Katee95","authorRoleId":8,"authorRole":"a staff member posting for a patient/service user","title":"Exceptional care","body":"I have been in hospital since having a kidney stone removed yesterday.
