I thought we were going to the xray so I had my partner wait in the waiting area while we went. \n\nTo then have no mention of an xray and be triaged again and told to just give him paracetamol. \n\nI was made to feel as though I shouldn't have taken him, and I was just wasting time.

I came to check up my newborn baby. Doctor invited us, but didn’t speak to us for about 5 minutes, typing something on computer and leaving us wait. Then she asked me to talk about baby’s symptoms. Whatever I mentioned she would aggressively contront, telling that it’s not a valid symptom. I told that I am trying to explain her symptoms as best as I can. Then she asked me to undress the baby. I agreed and asked to close the window, she said that the window doesn’t close. I undressed the baby, but instead of checking the baby she kept saying she needs my concent to check her up with the window being open. I told her that I give my concent, but she kept repeating the same thing keeping the baby waiting undressed. She then said that the baby is fine and her cough is due to producing extensive amount of saliva (the fact that the baby just had a chest infection and had to take antibiotics didn’t seem to be an important data). On our way out I asked administrator for doctor’s name, but she said they can’t give it to me. At that point the doctor started accusing me for attacking her and pointing to a zero tolerance poster on the wall. The baby was crying.

I have had ongoing surgical and gynocology issues for several years and seem to get nowhere when I am admitted into hospital and neither of these departments seem to want to take ownership of me or my health issues. Often seeming to pass the buck from one department to the other. I am always told that I am medically complicated.  \r\nI was admitted to hospital at the beginning of March with a suspected stroke as I was displaying several signs and symptoms of this. After more tests and scans I was moved to AMU where I spent a couple of days getting further tests. Medics where unsure what was wrong with me and one suggested that I could have possibly had a TIA which could have been caused by the HRT that I was prescribed along with the hormone injection I received 4 weeks previous to this hospital admission. I was informed this was my best possible chance of stopping my heavy bleeding (this has been since August 2022). After speaking to several medical staff I repeatedly kept asking to see a gynaecologist while I was in hospital with these issues. I was told several times that they would come and see me and then that they were far too busy to come and see me. I was understandably very upset and angry about this as I believe that I was the HRT that caused this latest hospital admission.  \r\nI was moved up to Ward 27 the same night that I received a very painful lumbar puncture with it taking at least 5 attempts to get through. I was in agony and really scared and stressed as I was still experiencing heavy bleeding and pain. The staff at ward 27 took very good care of me but yet again I was told by a doctor doing his rounds that they were not happy and they would get gynaecology to come and see me. Finally someone was going to help me or so I thought. Yet again they refused to come and when I spoke to another doctor they said that they had suggested to try 2 drugs together to stop the bleeding and that they would book me an urgent outpatient appointment. I was so frustrated going round in circles all the time that I asked if I could speak to a consultant myself and I was told no and they wouldn't go back and ask again for me. Basically that was it. I can't tell you how broken this made me feel and how much this is having an impact on my mental health and well-being and what it is doing to my husband and little girl.  \r\nI took the drugs and was told that I was being discharged later that day. After about 2 hours I started being violently sick and had to be given an anti sickness injection and couldn't go home.  \r\nThe treatment that I have experienced from the gynaecology department has been awful. I feel ignored and that they have placed no value in me and I have lost all faith in there ability to treat me as a patient. I am disappointed and disgusted and honesty they have made me feel that I don't want to ask for help again and I certainly don't want to come back in to hospital.  \r\nI have since had to contact the hospital to ask when my urgent appointment is only to be told my consultant is no longer available and another one is leaving too. The first appointment they have is at the end of April and I was informed in the hospital it would be 2 weeks time.","criticality":"moderately

I have had problems with my knee for as long as I remember.  \r\nWhen I arrived in the dept with my husband we had to wait in a seating area. You could see the nurses and doctors were busy but supportive of each other.  \r\nI was seen by an amazing ANP. I unfortunately have forgotten her name but she was fantastic, she put me at ease and the 3 of us had some banter which again helped with feelings of anxiety.  \r\nI was sent for an x-ray and when I returned was waiting about 15 mins max before being seen again. I had a soft tissue injury (felt like a total goofball going to hospital for that) and she referred me to the fracture clinic as a precaution. The ANP gave me fantastic advice on what to do next and provided me with crutches. All this was done within an hour.  \r\nThis is a huge thank you for the amazing care I received. I was listened to and treated as a person. Thank you to everyone from the NHS 24 call handler, x-ray and obviously the fantastic ANP.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-03-13T03:45:20.8933333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-03-15T10:33:05.01","readBy":[{"name":"Scottish Government","count":1},{"name":"NHS Forth Valley","count":8},{"name":"NHS 24","count":12}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1041120","id":"1041120"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1041120/responses","id":"1041120"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1041120/healthservices","id":"1041120"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1041120/tags","id":"1041120"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/forth-valley-royal-mias","id":"forth-valley-royal-mias","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/forth-valley-royal-radiology","id":"forth-valley-royal-radiology","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/nhs24-111","id":"NHS24-111","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/advice","id":"advice"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/crutches","id":"crutches"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fantastic%20staff","id":"fantastic staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/knee","id":"knee"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/minor%20injuries","id":"minor injuries"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/quick%20service","id":"quick service"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/x-ray","id":"X-ray"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/advanced%20nurse%20practitioner","id":"advanced nurse practitioner"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20at%20ease","id":"put at ease"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treated%20as%20a%20person","id":"treated as a person"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/listened%20to","id":"listened to"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1042266","id":"1042266"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1046403","id":"1046403"}]},{"id":1041005,"author":"TDWW21","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Surgery, staff and overall experience","body":"I recently under went planned surgery and can not thank the staff that I met along my way  \r\nHaving never had surgery before I was very nervous about how the procedure was going to go, but I really didn't need to be for I was reassured both before and after the surgery by caring and compassionate staff.Staff kept me updated, nothing was ever to much trouble and more importantly they made me feel like I was the only person they were caring for, my thoughts, feelings and needs were always taken into consideration and for that I can not thank them enough.  \r\nThe only blip of my stay was that they didn't have a bed for me to move to following surgery and that I was going to have to stay in recovery for the night, which I didn't mind as regardless of where I was I knew I would be receiving Fantastic care.

I really appreciated the nurses and doctors keeping myself and my husband informed of his plan of care so we were never left in the dark, I also appreciated the consideration they gave to treating a toddler and making him feel at ease, especially when dealing with things like cannulation and taking bloods etc.  \r\nHe was blue lighted to the Queen Elizabeth and again the care he received by the paramedic team on route to QE was second to none.  \r\nI just wanted to say a huge thank you to everyone involved in looking after my son, the care and compassion we were given will not be forgotten!","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-03-13T03:29:42.84","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-03-15T11:19:02.023","readBy":[{"name":"Scottish Government","count":1},{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":6},{"name":"Scottish Ambulance Service","count":3}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1041119","id":"1041119"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1041119/responses","id":"1041119"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1041119/healthservices","id":"1041119"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1041119/tags","id":"1041119"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/c313h_180","id":"C313H_180","score":5},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/scot-ambulance-emergency","id":"scot-ambulance-emergency","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/worried","id":"worried"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/above%20and%20beyond","id":"above and beyond"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ambulance","id":"ambulance"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bacterial%20infections","id":"bacterial infections"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bloods","id":"bloods"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cannula","id":"cannula"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care%20plan","id":"care plan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/chicken%20pox","id":"chicken pox"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/consideration","id":"consideration"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctors","id":"doctors"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/facial%20swelling","id":"facial swelling"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/heard","id":"heard"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/informed","id":"informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/paediatric","id":"paediatric"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/paramedic%20care","id":"paramedic care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/paramedics","id":"paramedics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/updated","id":"updated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appreciated","id":"appreciated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20for","id":"cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassion","id":"compassion"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20ease","id":"at ease"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/considered","id":"considered"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/toddler%20care","id":"toddler care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/big%20thank%20you","id":"big thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/second%20to%20none","id":"second to none"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1042380","id":"1042380"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1043335","id":"1043335"}]},{"id":1041700,"author":"ariesgd49","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Alcohol Detoxification experience","body":"So in March 2023 I was referred for alcohol detox by CGL Brighton following a self-referral approximately 14 months prior. I was originally due to do a home detox in August 2022 but at the last minute this was switched to an inpatient detox due to concerns about the health of my liver following an ultrasound that showed some issues that needed to be closely monitored. At the time I was quite disappointment by this decision as I wanted to proceed with the detox as soon as possible but unfortunately had to wait a further 6 months for an admission date.  \r\nSince being here I have found all of the staff to be very kind and informative and I also found the other inpatients to be very welcoming and friendly. Medication was administered at regular intervals and all of my questions were answered by the staff to the best of their abilities. The food provided was excellent if I was to give any criticism of that it was that choice was limited to one or possibly 2 options however the quality was not in doubt.  \r\nI think at times there could have been slightly better communication between CGL and Dame Carol for example CGL arranged for my discharge transport to be provided on a date when no discharge was available.  \r\nOverall I would say the experience was excellent and my only main source of concern was that the mattress' provided did not suit a painful back condition that would interrupt my sleep more than I felt was necessary, however I accept this may be due to my specific medical needs and I do not know if other inpatients suffered with the same issue.  \r\nOther than some minor technical issues that were quickly resolved I would say my overall experience was excellent and I would very much like to thank all of the staff for their kind and considerate manner and would recommend the facility to anyone who in genuinely seeking help to better themselves regardless of the specific nature of their addiction or addictions.","criticality":"minimally critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-03-14T14:35:36.85","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-03-15T11:19:36.973","readBy":[{"name":"Midlands Partnership NHS Foundation Trust","count":3},{"name":"Change Grow Live","count":8}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1041700","id":"1041700"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1041700/responses","id":"1041700"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1041700/healthservices","id":"1041700"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1041700/tags","id":"1041700"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/nms-brighton-hove","id":"nms-brighton-hove","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rrex4-inclusion-dcds","id":"RREX4-inclusion-dcds","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/addiction","id":"addiction"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/alcohol","id":"alcohol"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/detox","id":"detox"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/food","id":"food"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mattress","id":"mattress"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/other%20patients","id":"Other patients"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/positive","id":"positive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wait%20for%20admission","id":"Wait for admission"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/welcomed","id":"welcomed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happy","id":"happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thankful","id":"Thankful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/time%20for%20questions","id":"time for questions"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/food%20quality","id":"food quality"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/more%20food%20options","id":"more food options"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1045884","id":"1045884"}]},{"id":1041239,"author":"Mummy69","authorRoleId":3,"authorRole":"a parent/guardian","title":"Compassionate and professional","body":"My teenage daughter has been having physiotherapy for a few years now.

The Receptionist says, \"sorry no emergency available as they've all been given, call back tomorrow morning\". But I've been calling the practice for 3 days at 8:45am and every day is the same.\n\nWhen complaining about it the Receptionist says got to the A&E department > this is extremely unethical as my medical issues are not urgent, no wonder the A&E is always full as most surgery do not give any appointments.\n\nOther advice by the Receptionist calls 111. I do call 111 but their advice is call your doctor.\n\nThis was the same scenario before the Pandemic but has gone so much worst since.\nThe practice needs an auditor to come & review.\n\nAdditionally, doctors are always either on annual leave or they’re sick.\n\nFurthermore, the whole practice isn't tidy, so many posters displayed they don't make sense anymore, they just look like advertisements instead of medical poster. \n\nThere is a tablet to book your arrival (at least pre-Pandemic) and 9 times out of 10 it was not working, so you had to wait so long at the reception.\n\nReceptionists are not very friendly either (some are luckily).\n\nHowever, if miraculously, you do see a doctor, there are mostly very polite and nice - well that was pre-Pandemic as since I never manage to see any. The face-to-face consultation barely last 5 minutes, this includes research on google, taking the tension and writing prescription. So can't call that a consultation.\nThe phone consultation that I finally had after calling for 3 days in a row was equally from a very nice and polite GP but that lasting barely 5 minutes, I didn't have time to list all my symptoms, so she let me talk and the whole call lasted 12 minutes, including the explanation of the medicine she was giving me as these were new to me.\n\nDo not register there. I'm trying to find a new surgery but, in my area, they aren't taking new patients.\n","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2023-03-14T19:07:49","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2023-03-15T12:20:47","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1042302","id":"1042302"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1042302/responses","id":"1042302"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1042302/healthservices","id":"1042302"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1042302/tags","id":"1042302"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/f84081","id":"F84081","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency","id":"emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/face","id":"face"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doing%20well","id":"doing well"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/in%20the%20way","id":"in the way"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/like%20myself","id":"like myself"}]},{"id":1042301,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Not recommended at all !","body":"We've been calling our GP every now and then either for some of my wife's medical issues or for our kids.\nSeveral problems in communication can almost never find an appointment when you need one, and if by a slight chance you do, if you miss the GP's call (as they examine you by phone, which I still don't understand) you have to start the process all over again and book another one.\nVery disappointed overall, already thinking of finding another GP.\nI have concerns about my health sometimes and due to what I'm having to go through, I don't even want to call them.

I duly went along at the appointed time, and checked in and then sat down to wait.  After 30 minutes, and being the only person in the waiting area, I asked the receptionist how much longer it would be as I had taken time away from work.  The receptionist advised he would send a note to the nurse, and within seconds of that I heard someone in a very loud voice saying \"well that's just great, just great.  I need to be out of here by one and so don't have time for this!\"  Now I can't be sure this was about me, but it was very coincidental.  I waited a further 10 minutes and then went back.  The receptionist looked very embarrassed and asked if I would like to make another appointment, which I declined.  I ended up going to a private GP who found my peak flow was deplorable, and I am now on a treatment plan.  I left Heathfielde surgery feeling very upset, and like I was an invisible nuisance.
