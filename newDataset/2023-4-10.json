He could be quite abusive to staff and family, but we put this down to anxiety about the fact that he may die. He had terminal lung cancer.  \r\nHe came home with no care plan.  \r\nI rang 111 as I did not feel he should have been allowed home without some type of care package.  \r\nI was told they can not force care!  \r\nA district nurse arrived to sort out his bed sores, and when I spoke of my concerns they arranged private carers to come in, and they were marvellous. However, I still believe my cousin should have had the best end-of-life care. He was incontinent and he also had a bad sore on his foot, which turned to gangrene. His neighbour used to clean him up. He could be very abusive as I have said before, but he was very poorly.  \r\nHe phoned for an ambulance and was taken to QMC Notts as he refused to go to the Derby Royal. He was put on oxygen, and passed away that night.  \r\nI feel he could have had much better end-of-life care and it may just be coinciding, but he received none. I appreciate the NHS are experiencing difficult times, but surely care comes first.  \r\nI feel very sad that my cousin had to die in these circumstances, and now he has gone, not much we can do about it.

I told the receptionist but they said there was nothing they could do. Really? Maybe use a headphone and close the door, and other staff close the door too.  \r\nSurely this is a breach of data protection.

Lyndsay, was great all throughout my pregnancy, reassuring me and as a first time mom I needed a fair bit of reassurance. She also, advocated for me to have a home birth as the service was suspended around the time I was due, and for that I am forever grateful to both Lyndsay and Kiki.  \r\nDue to a rupture I ended up in hospital and was looked after in the labour ward, the midwife was absolutely amazing in particular to my husband when I was away in theater. The theater staff was also amazing.  \r\nThen I was also looked after by Amy in ward 16, Amy was also amazing, she reassured me and helped me get home promptly and supported me when I needed it.  \r\nOnce home the community midwives came to see me regularly, offered a great support and were just amazing. I feel so lucky to have had such great professionals by my family's side.  \r\nNow I am been supported by the great  \r\nHealth Visitor Beauty, who is very knowledgable, approachable and just amazing with my baby, husband and I.  \r\nOverall, everyone who I came across from NHS Borders was and is absolutely amazing and provided an outstanding care.

The surgery ended up being a little more complicated than I expected and Iâ€™d like to thank Mr Gibson for his determination, professionalism and surgical skill in resolving the problem. Iâ€™d highly recommend him to anyone in need of help.My recovery has now been managed by the wonderful Nursing Staff of fracture clinic 3 at Alnagelvin.This team has been providing excellent wound management for me and have made my recovery much easier than I expected.The courteous, down to earth, good humoured feeling within the clinic put me very much at ease from the beginning and the nursing staff then back that up with incredible levels of attention to detail and wound treatment excellence.Once I realised this team had my back with recovery, well Iâ€™ve been able to relax. (That is massive not only for the physical side but also the mental side of recovery).Iâ€™ve now been treated by a few different pairs of the staff and it's been very obvious of how great a team they are. They easily bounce opinions off each other to ensure optimum treatment and have gained my total trust.I consider myself very lucky to have been treated by this team and humbly thank them for everything they have done.Eleven outta Ten !!Kind regards  \r\n","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-04-06T17:42:13.4166667","progress":"Story has a

Extremely personable, non-judgemental and professional, she was a pleasure to have in my home.  \r\nEileen visited next and was an absolute wealth of experience and knowledge in talking myself and my partner through what may happen during labour-insightful, supported my understanding and made me confident that I could cope with labour through her honest account of the science bits and the possible variations that could happen-she eased my anxiety no end! My baby came a month early, a couple of days before I was due to see Eileen again and I received a wonderful message from her whilst in hospital congratulating me on the birth of my baby boy. She made me feel very special and like she genuinely cared about supporting me to be the best that I could be. Zoe revisited us at 4months post birth and again was warm, friendly yet professional in her visit. She reassured me that I was doing a good job, reminded me to be kind to myself on the days things are trickier and keep the 3 Cs in mind. She listened to how I was doing as a new mum, weighed my baby, plotted his growth and talked me through what that meant and celebrated with me the milestones reached so far. She once again signposted me to more information that was specific to my circumstances and sent me a follow up email with links to websites etc to support me -with baby brain going on it was really helpful to receive the email later the same day and again, made me feel well supported and cared for.Between these two amazing ladies, I could not have felt more supported during my pregnancy and as a new mum. They have also reassured me that this is a service that I can access should I feel I need it in the future-nothing was too much hassle for these ladies and I canâ€™t thank them enough for the fabulous job they do.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-04-06T21:00:20.91","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-04-10T10:46:52.787","readBy":[{"name":"Stockport NHS Foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1051467","id":"1051467"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1051467/responses","id":"1051467"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1051467/healthservices","id":"1051467"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1051467/tags","id":"1051467"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rwj-hv","id":"RWJ-hv","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/birth","id":"birth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/experience","id":"experience"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/insightful","id":"insightful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/knowledge","id":"knowledge"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/labour","id":"labour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pregnancy","id":"pregnancy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professional","id":"professional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassurance","id":"reassurance"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/signposting","id":"signposting"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/special","id":"special"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/warm","id":"warm"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing","id":"amazing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wonderful","id":"wonderful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/in%20contact","id":"in contact"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1052590","id":"1052590"}]},{"id":1051578,"author":"Matdw53","authorRoleId":8,"authorRole":"a staff member posting for a patient/service user","title":"I havent had any issues since i came in here","body":"I have been quite pleased with the care that I have been getting in 4 south.

Mum has complexed mobility so this was really hurt her. Once in the house, I was asked where the carers were, advised the time they were here, so I was asked if I could use the hoist!!! I said no as it would not be safe and due to my bad back I would never put Mum at risk.  \r\nSo once again, they transferred Mum by this sheet, with the wheelchair at the corner of the chair, not safe and they could have dropped Mum!!!  \r\n  \r\nWe have used patient transport many a time, and they have always been fantastic, but this time it was a horrible experience for my Mum!","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-04-07T02:57:51.55","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-04-10T11:01:41.597","readBy":[{"name":"Scottish Ambulance Service","count":6}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1051520","id":"1051520"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1051520/responses","id":"1051520"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1051520/healthservices","id":"1051520"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1051520/tags","id":"1051520"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/scot-ambulance-pts","id":"scot-ambulance-pts","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/patient%20transport","id":"patient transport"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/training","id":"training"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unsafe","id":"unsafe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/left%20in%20pain","id":"left in pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/timings","id":"timings"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1052489","id":"1052489"}]},{"id":1051594,"author":"Katee95","authorRoleId":8,"authorRole":"a staff member posting for a patient/service user","title":"Fall at home","body":"I had a fall at home and came into hospital at 9.00 this morning.

They need more staff.  \r\nBut all the staff in coronary care, no matter how busy they are always make sure their patients are well looked after.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-04-07T19:06:26.45","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-04-10T11:19:06.907","readBy":[{"name":"Southern Health and Social Care Trust","count":3}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1051657","id":"1051657"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1051657/responses","id":"1051657"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1051657/healthservices","id":"1051657"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1051657/tags","id":"1051657"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_33020_320","id":"ZT003_33020_320","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/brilliant%20staff","id":"brilliant staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/clean%20ward","id":"clean ward"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cleanliness","id":"cleanliness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/coronary%20care","id":"coronary care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/food","id":"food"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/more%20staff","id":"more staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/no%20complaints","id":"no complaints"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/well%20looked%20after","id":"well looked after"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing","id":"amazing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treated%20very%20well","id":"treated very well"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1052340","id":"1052340"}]},{"id":1051623,"author":"Niamhh1","authorRoleId":8,"authorRole":"a staff member posting for a patient/service user","title":"I think the girls have a great set up in the unit","body":"The nurses have a heart of gold.

I was induced due to late stage pregnancy health complications, followed by a midwife led birth. Throughout the process the midwives were fantastic - present, helpful, clear in their communication, caring (I find this difficult to quantify but very important), and efficient with interventions when needed (while still checking my consent and comprehension at significant moments), all during, what seemed like, a very busy shift.  \r\nThis may have been business as usual for them, but in contrast to my experiences delivering my other child in 2020, this was a marked improvement. During my previous experience, I was extremely isolated, did not have visual access needs respected, was not given access to painkillers for most of labour, and was not given access to food for 36 hours (of which only the first 14 were spent in labour). I know the hospital addressed some of the issues with my first birth following feedback, but I wanted to note how much of a difference having support throughout from staff made this time around better. In particular I wanted to note the attentiveness and care of the student midwives who were working on the labour and maternity wards, and of their supervising lead midwives. They especially gave a calm and supportive response when the crash cord needed pulled and my son was born unresponsive and with the cord around him. He's fine now, but it was terrifying in the moment and they were wonderful - calm, efficient, and caring.  \r\nI have since had none of the problems with severe postnatal anxiety or depression I had following my other child's birth, and I attribute this largely to a positive and supported (if - let's not get too rose tinted - still very painful) birth experience. So - thank you, to the team at QEUH.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-04-06T19:57:14.64","progress":"Story has a
