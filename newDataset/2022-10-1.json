Everyone did what I was told they would do, from the stoma nurse who I met in the pre-op room (but didn't need her services again), to the anaesthetist , the gynae surgeon who came from the Liverpool Women's Hospital to do his part of the procedure, the local surgeon from the colorectal service and Registrar who did the rest of my mammoth operation and fed back to me in HDU, to every member of nursing staff (and IV Team) who looked after me in HDU, and especially on Ward 4 during my stay I owe a debt of gratitude. I cannot thank them enough for their care, concern and encouragement. They are a great team providing an invaluable service, and should be acknowledged as such.

There is no face to face communication what so ever. At times the doctors send out a web link from the internet which you can just access your self with information of the symptoms you are experiencing. The doctors who are at the GP are just newly qualified and how no experience towards the way they communicate with patience. There is always someone new at the receptionist and 90% of the time have no clue about things and give out wrong information.

The phone system is continually full and they ask you not to phone but to use the online system. I would much prefer to use the online system as this is easier if I'm working. But the surgery close the online system from 3pm each day and it stays closed until opening the following day. It's also closed at the weekend. What's the point of an online system you can't use out of hours. After finally finding a time in my working day where I was able to complete the online form, 5 days later I still haven't had a reply so I still haven't been able to make my appointment for my screening that I need. I have since tried ringing but after waiting 15 minutes and still being told I was 12 in the queue I was unable to stay on the phone any longer (I was at work).\n Their phone system tells you if it's not urgent there's a delay of 4 weeks for them to be able to accept routine requests, which again, is not helpful if a patient is unsure how serious something could be.\n This is completely unacceptable, patients cannot ask questions, request medications or make appointments. Requests are not followed up, results are not sent out so you have to go through the painful process of trying to contact the surgery for your results all over again. This surgery is not meeting the needs of it's patients.

I was greeted by a lovely welcoming staff member and then cared for by the most personable, caring and attentive nursing staff before, during and after my procedures. The Consultant was very personable and incredibly thorough, much more so than I have experienced with similar examinations at other Trusts.

From booking my appointment online to receiving the vaccination at the clinic everything went without a hitch. The staff members at the clinic were very friendly people, I was in and out with no fuss at all, well done and thank you everyone.

There is no doubt they go the extra mile and in doing so one doctor saved my life. They are always sympathetic and listen, I never feel rushed. They discuss possible courses of treatments with me and their likely outcomes. I always leave the surgery with confidence that I have been very well looked after. My wife and I refuse to move out of the Hadleigh catchment area because we both feel we wouldn’t find a doctors surgery anywhere near as good as The Hadleigh Practice. I can’t fault The Hadleigh Practice and consider myself very lucky to be their patient. Thank you The Hadleigh Practice.
