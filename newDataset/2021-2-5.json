During our time on the ward visiting (end of life allowances for visiting) we witnessed poor hygiene/infection control measures on the ward. The bin in his room was literally spilling out all over the floor. In any ward this is disgusting, let alone in a covid ward. I note this is an area the hospital has already been pulled up on in inspections.  \r\nThe quiet room was unclean. In the 2 days we spent on the ward, it was never cleaned. There were dirty, used mugs and half-eaten biscuits on the table (infection control on a covid ward?!) The bed was on its side and there were pictures all over the floor. It was offered as a breathing space for us. Our relative was blind. We were told that he couldn’t have a TV on in his room because it wasn’t working. As soon as we arrived, we put the TV on. It was working. Nobody had checked. My blind relative was sat in a room with no TV because nobody had checked. When we initially asked about the TV, we reiterated that our relative was blind. The staff response was, ‘They’re all blind in here.’ Our relative had limited capacity. This issue was addressed at admission and communicated with several staff. However, upon his death, we received a call from someone who wanted to speak to him to discuss the clinical trial he was participating it. We are disgusted that proper consent was not obtained. We have received an apology for this but it is terrible practice and is a complete disgrace. We were told we would be notified of any changes in his care. We weren’t. He was put on oxygen and none of us knew. We spent HOURS trying to get through to the ward to no avail. Having been told we would be contacted we took some comfort knowing that if anything big happened, we would be informed. A DNR was also put in place without discussion with family. Upon calling the ward, we were asked to wait whilst the staff member checked on our relative to report back on how he was. We overheard staff discussing how pointless the meeting they had to attend was and how it was a waste of time. We were told initially that staff would help him mobilise to his chair because his mobility was the biggest concern we (and medical staff) had at the time. In his first few days on the ward, he wasn’t moved/helped to his chair. When asked why this was we were told there were no staff so he had to lie in bed all day. When we arrived, we were shocked at his appearance. His medical notes from that morning detailed that he was ‘bright.’ There was nothing bright about his condition. The room was freezing. Staff apologised and told us they had complained about the temperature of the room on every shift they had been on because it was harmful for the health of patients. Regardless of this, he had ONE thin bed sheet on him and was very cold. His inner mouth had medication stuck to his skin. No effort had been made to check he had swallowed his tablets. He hadn’t been given any oral care due to the condition of his mouth/tongue (which improved within hours of us being there and caring for him.) We were promised we could see him on FaceTime calls but this didn’t happen because the iPad apparently wasn’t working (although, given the ‘broken TV’ we have little faith in anything we were told.) We raised concerns with a consultant who promised to call us back. It never happened. We asked what he had eaten. Nobody knew for 48 hrs. We asked for a fluid/food chart to be started because it was apparent that nobody was monitoring him. Given his diabetes, we were horrified to learn this. When we arrived at the ward, we had a discussion with a nurse. They were, without question, the most patronising person any of us have ever met. One of my relatives was crying, watching her husband die and the nurse was jovially discussing how much they loved being in a ward because they could shave them and bath them like they used to in their early days. What that had to do with us, none of us could fathom. Even more disgustingly, we arrived to see him after he had been in hospital for over a week and we were asked what he liked to be called. He was now completely unresponsive and they had only just asked this? No ‘About Me’ was completed. Nobody bothered to check his capacity issues, despite consistently telling us he was confused. When we finally said he had to come home to die, palliative care told us that the care he had received was unacceptable. The nurses told us it was unacceptable. The doctors told us it was unacceptable. The healthcare workers told us it was unacceptable. Upon leaving, a staff member on the ward told us we had better be careful not to end up in the papers for taking our relative home to die. Ninewells have failed our relative and failed us in the worst way. We experienced terrible communication, untruths and poor care for someone we held dear to our hearts. We have requested a copy of all medical notes and intend on raising several concerns and complaints. No family or patient should endure what we have. I worry for the patients without advocates. What of their health and well-being? Basic human rights? We aim to make the disgraces we experienced public and refuse to accept poor practise under the banner of ‘It’s Covid, times are hard.’","criticality":"strongly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-01-26T20:35:14.9866667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-02-05T10:27:23.46","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Tayside","count":23},{"name":"Scottish Government","count":3}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/819268","id":"819268"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/819268/responses","id":"819268"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/819268/healthservices","id":"819268"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/819268/tags","id":"819268"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/t101h_430","id":"T101H_430","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/concern","id":"concern"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confused","id":"confused"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disgusted","id":"disgusted"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/shocked","id":"shocked"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/alone","id":"alone"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breathing","id":"breathing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/broken","id":"broken"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/consistency","id":"consistency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/death","id":"death"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diabetes","id":"diabetes"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/die","id":"die"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/end%20of%20life","id":"end of life"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/honesty","id":"honesty"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/horrified","id":"horrified"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hygiene","id":"hygiene"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/infection","id":"infection"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/integrity","id":"integrity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/manner","id":"manner"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mobility","id":"mobility"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/monitoring","id":"monitoring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/oral","id":"oral"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/oxygen","id":"oxygen"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/palliative","id":"palliative"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/skin","id":"skin"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/temperature","id":"temperature"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/terrible","id":"terrible"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/family%20kept%20informed","id":"family kept informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/oral%20care","id":"Oral care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dnr%20conversation","id":"dnr conversation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/competency","id":"competency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/crying","id":"crying"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/about%20me","id":"about me"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/820532","id":"820532"}]},{"id":820043,"author":"bambitommy","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Social prescribing helps me cope and help others","body":"I am a tenant of SYHA, I have a house.

When my husband was terminally ill five year ago I had a lot of help from St Ledgers' Homes under their terminal health care arrangements, they did a number of adaptations around the house including the bathroom. This helped me to care for him as I nursed him at home in the last few months of his life.  \r\nMy GP recommended me for Social Prescribing and through this contact I became a Social Prescribing volunteer myself. I now go out with a Social Prescribing coordinator to visit potential clients referred by GPs. If the person wants to take part I visit them on a regular basis.

Not only is the person who wants the service getting a benefit I am too because it helps me cope with my own loneliness and the continuing bereavement.  \r\nI have enjoyed the training courses including one on helping people in bereavements and another on working with partially sighted clients.

This is the same child who is similarly unsupported by Rainbow House.  \r\nWe have gone round in circles since she was referred with no real plan or view for diagnosis. There has been NO contact nor input from the doctor or their team in 12 months and I’m sorry to say that I now have little to no confidence in those who are meant to be supporting a child who very clearly needs some sort of support which she is unable to access due to the reluctance of those caring for her to commit to a diagnosis. 6 years old with a speech delay, incontinence and a hearing issue that is struggling her way through p1 when she can actually attend never mind when they can’t and she has NO support other than from myself, my partner and my mother.  \r\nWe’re at a stage now where we are having to purchase incontinence products because nobody will provide a diagnosis of anything which we have been told is required to access prescription incontinence pants for her as children’s products no longer fit nor are appropriate.

Such a good experience and brilliant care during a time that can be very scary and nerve wracking.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-02-04T15:00:42.5833333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-02-05T16:19:47.973","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Ayrshire & Arran","count":5},{"name":"Office of Colin Smyth, MSP for South Scotland","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/820136","id":"820136"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/820136/responses","id":"820136"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/820136/healthservices","id":"820136"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/820136/tags","id":"820136"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/a111h_501","id":"A111H_501","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/birth","id":"birth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/brilliant","id":"brilliant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good","id":"good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helped","id":"helped"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/maternity","id":"maternity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medical%20team","id":"Medical Team"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/midwives","id":"midwives"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20good","id":"not good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thankful","id":"Thankful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wonderful","id":"wonderful"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/820380","id":"820380"}]},{"id":820142,"author":"Wawa","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"They all need medals","body":"So my doctor sent me to hospital , once I arrived at the a and e department I gave my letter , the staff got me to a chair as I was in a lot of pain , I was in the wrong area so a member of staff came and got me , I was crying at this point and they got me straight in to talk to someone who , soon got me booked in and through into a room for me to lay down !!  \r\nIn a and e , the staff were very friendly and couldn’t do anymore for me, checked me regular and asked how pain level was and was there to talk and listen when I needed to say how I felt !

Nothing was too much trouble ( they actually told me off for not pressing the buzzer , when I was in pain cos I didn’t want to be a hindrance ) they made time to comfort me and were very professional at the same time , although we going through a pandemic , the staff on ward 1B at pilgrim hospital made me feel I was with friends , they sat with me for 15-20 min which was like having family or friends visit .

Personally I would recommend No Sedation but obviously this is the patients choice.  \r\nAfter about 30 minutes in the recovery ward with a Cup of Coffee provided I was dressed and on my way home.  \r\nThanks to all at PRI Endoscopy Suite😉","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-02-05T11:59:38.27","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-02-05T17:25:55.67","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Tayside","count":9}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/820195","id":"820195"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/820195/responses","id":"820195"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/820195/healthservices","id":"820195"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/820195/tags","id":"820195"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/t202h_301","id":"T202H_301","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/brilliant","id":"brilliant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cramps","id":"cramps"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/efficient","id":"efficient"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/quick","id":"quick"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sedation","id":"sedation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/welcoming","id":"welcoming"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hope","id":"Hope"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/relieved","id":"relieved"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thanks","id":"thanks"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/no%20hope","id":"no hope"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/829240","id":"829240"}]},{"id":820198,"author":"errandkw35","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Colonoscopy","body":"I had this procedure at PRI last week at 16.15.  \r\nI should like to thank Maureen for her great care ,dedication and humour  \r\nThe procedures was carried out magnificently and so very gently that it was finished before I realised it was over.  \r\nA special thank you also to Steph and the other nurse in the room ( sorry did not get name )  \r\nAlso a special thank you to the nurse who welcomed me into the department and the nurse too in the Recovery room ( again sorry for not remembering your names )  \r\nI am so grateful and honoured that people like these work for NHS  \r\nThank you  \r\nPS I noticed on the day 59 patients failed to turn up in January for appointments  \r\nThese people ought to be severely fined particularly during this pandemic !","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-02-05T12:39:00.4266667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-02-05T17:27:20.677","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Tayside","count":11}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/820198","id":"820198"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/820198/responses","id":"820198"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/820198/healthservices","id":"820198"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/820198/tags","id":"820198"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/t202h_301","id":"T202H_301","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dedicated","id":"dedicated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/humour","id":"humour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/welcomed","id":"welcomed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/welcoming","id":"welcoming"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/829238","id":"829238"}]},{"id":820199,"author":"corvusqm54","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Excellent and reassuring visit","body":"Had small procedures .felt really safe staff were really great.

This effort and care from her will stay with me forever and went far and beyond. I hope she knows how special to my family she was in them two nights.  \r\nShe said to me how well I seemed to handle what at times was a very distressing time for my gran and very hard to watch. She doesn't know this calm reaction was partly due to how caring she was. It took a few hours after my grans passing for the grief to set in.

I had to have a COVID test as well and self isolate beforehand, not difficult as the weather was abysmal. This morning on arrival at the hospital at 8. 15am, I was seen quickly, met the endoscopist, Mr Amin who is lovely, and before I knew it the procedure was going ahead. I’ve never had an endoscopy before but know a few who have.  \r\nThe nurses, Lesley and Yvonne were amazing, so kind and considerate as was Mr Amin. It was all over in 1/2 hour! . Apart from a bit of discomfort going round the ‘corners’ it was ok and I only needed a couple of breaths of Entinox, and no need for sedation fortunately. The aftercare was great, I felt very safe and cared for the whole time I was there and even better there is nothing untoward, just one of those things, but better to be safe than sorry.  \r\nI’ve done bowel tests since I was 50 and this was the first positive one. A colonoscopy is not something you’d want to do every day but having it done at that early stage usually means if there is anything untoward it can be dealt with quickly, It gave me great peace of mind.

Someone had to stay back home to take care of her, so we started looking for options. A friend’s friend had recommended Abicare to us at that time. I quickly checked it out and got in touch with them. They heard us out patiently and explained the home care services they provide. We were looking for someone who could be with her 24/7 and on hearing that Abicare provided live-in care, we were more than happy. The carer assigned to my sister was very sweet and caring.

After a week or so in and out of hospital she was given a diagnosis of Complex Regional Pain Syndrome and discharged, with care to be taken up by a consultant neurologist at Birmingham Children's Hospital.  \r\nCRPS is a complex condition requiring a range of care to work towards recovery, but we seem to have slipped into a gap between the initial care at Sandwell and Birmingham Children's Hospital taking up our daughter's case. In the meantime, we feel like we've been abandoned to deal with things ourselves, using what little good quality information we've been able to find online. She's had one physio appointment since she left hospital, and one counselling session which we organised ourselves. We had to organise our own wheelchair and my wife's currently going round in circles trying to organise an OT, having been directed towards a service who told her that they wouldn't deal with someone with CRPS because 'we only deal with neurological conditions' (Which CRPS is).  \r\nThe consultant at BCH wanted her to have nerve conduction studies done before her appointment, and we were told an appointment would come through soon. We'd heard nothing by the second week of January so decided to chase up and were told, although she was on the system at BCH, no referral had been made for the studies, and the consultant was away for the whole of January. The receptionist said she'd get someone else to look into the referral and get back to us, but no-one did, so we had to chase up, also speaking again to the really helpful paediatrician at Sandwell who initially referred us. Despite weeks of this we've evidently had to wait for the consultant to return for the process to begin, and it’ll be almost a month from diagnosis before the studies are done and obviously even later to see the consultant.  \r\nAll the information we've managed to find so far stresses the importance of acting quickly on CRPS, with the time taken to start proper treatment having a major effect on the time it takes to recover. Obviously we're not medically trained, but it's clear that our daughter's visibly regressing. The exercises given to us by the physio are too much for her to tolerate, and we're constantly having to push her to do exercises she finds extremely painful (we tried to ask about the medication she's been given to control the pain, but again were told this would have to wait until the consultants return).  \r\nWe keep thinking she might be making slight progress with bending her knee, but if anything that’s plateaued too. She can no longer flex her foot, which she could when she left hospital. She can't wear her tracksuit bottoms or tolerate bathing, both of which she could earlier. It's having a huge effect on her mental health, with ever more frequent panic attacks, and she keeps telling us that she wishes she could die. It feels completely brutal, and without any indication of how we move forward from here, it feels like we've been left to fend for ourselves.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-02-03T17:01:38.29","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-02-08T09:20:03.697","readBy":[{"name":"Birmingham Women's and Children's NHS Foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/820064","id":"820064"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/820064/responses","id":"820064"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/820064/healthservices","id":"820064"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/820064/tags","id":"820064"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rq301_300","id":"RQ301_300","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rq301_400","id":"RQ301_400","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rxk01_180","id":"RXK01_180","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/abandoned","id":"abandoned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/attention","id":"attention"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/counselling","id":"counselling"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/foot","id":"foot"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/leg","id":"leg"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain%20control","id":"pain control"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/physio","id":"physio"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/referral","id":"referral"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/speed%20of%20response","id":"Speed of response"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wait%20for%20results","id":"wait for results"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/joined%20up%20services","id":"Joined up Services"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/struggling","id":"struggling"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/access%20to%20specialist%20services","id":"access to specialist services"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/824340","id":"824340"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/824427","id":"824427"}]},{"id":820105,"author":"charaje44","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"steps2change Lincolnshire complaint","body":"I was given a weekly telephone apt after referal from the GP.  \r\nThey gave me an over-simplified service which offered nothing more than goal setting over the phone rather than in your journal. They know you're self-aware enough to set your own goals, because you have decided to seek help, this is a very patronising service which did not support me.  \r\nAfter a 13 week wait for an appointment, I cannot believe how poor this service is. Appointments are only 20 minutes long and they tried to avoid listening to my personal situation as much as possible and instead try to set minute goals for the week (something I've undoubtedly tried in the 3 months waiting for an appointment, let alone before). It is so incredibly difficult opening up to somebody and facing your struggles head on, and when that is met with a deaf ear and a rushed 20 minute appointment trying to pigeon hole you into one of the 2 CBT courses they offer (either setting goals to get you out of the house if you have anxiety or setting small goals to get you doing things you cannot do because of depression) this understandably compounds your belief that nobody wants to or is able to help you. Shocking.  \r\nWhen I expressed that I was feeling rushed and unheard, I was told \"I don't think so\". Incredibly unprofessional. Furthermore, the therapist spending a large proportion of the 20 minute appointment talking about themselves. The therapist was repeatedly 5 minutes late to this already short slot - who on earth is going to understand the complexity and desperation of your situation after three 15 minute phone calls (especially when they talk about themselves more than listening to you). The scores that you have to fill in each week to assess your current state were checked at the very end of the appointment when there is no time remaining to discuss your thoughts or feelings.  \r\nI politely raised all of my concerns with the therapist who gave me a lot of attitude and was extremely defensive and asked me \"what would you like us to do?\". I am shocked, I was just looking for some help.  \r\nThis service was far far too simplified to offer actual mental health support for me as person who has been suffering for more than 2 weeks. Which is everyone trying to access the service, given that the wait time is at least 12 weeks.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-02-04T10:28:42.9033333","progress":"Story

I also suffer from Depression, and as a result of the pain I am always in, and the fact that I have not been given my usual anti-depressant medication, it has just got worse.  \r\nI can't walk properly due to excessive pain in my achilles and feet, and that has now caused problems with my knees, which already have osteoarthritis and my hip which was under control, but has now relapsed.  \r\nI have not been able to sleep through the night for months. I always wake up several times a night in pain and have to use ice spray and take more pain medication in order to go back to sleep.  \r\nOn arriving here in North Lanarkshire I was on several treatment plans and all of these problems were being managed well, but none of these have continued due to covid, as well as not being able to get a Psychiatrist/Psychologist/Orthopaedic surgeon/Audiologist/Physiotherapy/acupuncture/pain therapy/ appointment. My conditions call for ongoing management and therefore the 10+ years of previous treatment that I have had has been wasted, as I am back to square one.  \r\nI have only had one GP appointment, which was last week, where the Dr suggested more pain medication and put me on a list for xrays, which may take a while. My GP prescribed Pregabalin, which I am reluctant to take, as I have been on it previously and the side effects were very bad. I have carpal tunnel in both wrists which I was told to get my own splints for as the NHS could not supply these at the moment. I asked if they could assist me with my other health issues as I had not managed to see a GP in 10months, but they said that he could only deal with the shoulder/carpal tunnel problem. The GP is not taking appointments and all of the referrals that have supposedly been done have come to nothing.  \r\nBasically, the only Dr that I have seen in the last year has been the Rheumatologist, who decided not to put me back on the Abatacept Infusion which I have been on for 8 yrs, but said that they are not sure if this will cause long term damage or not, and the referrals to Maxillo-facial (my jaw clicks out of joint, is painful and makes an awful noise when eating), Foot and ankle (Achilles tendonitis & unstability), and ortho (hip & neck pain/instability), I have heard nothing from anyone.  \r\nThe GP apparently referred me to the Audiologist last year (I am more than 50% deaf with one hearing aid that works), I have not heard a thing. When I call to ask for batteries, which I incidentally did receive early last year, I am now told I can't have as I have no card from the Audiologist, which I am still waiting to see.  \r\nI was referred to an alternate treatment clinic while still living in Glasgow last Feb, so that I could have acupuncture and physio, which I never actually got to. But apparently they can't offer me that in North Larnarkshire, which makes no sense to me at all.  \r\nI also need to see a gynecological urologist, as I have a severely prolapsed bladder (which has had several surgeries), which I mentioned to my GP, but he said that he could not deal with that at the moment. So have not even been referred.  \r\nIn short, I have had basically no help at all for a year and everyone is blaming it on covid. I am 100% aware of how dangerous covid is and have been shielding as was recommended by my GP, but the severe ongoing pain is making my depression worse and with not being supplied with my Bupropion, and with only one hearing aid working and not getting battery supplies my life is getting more difficult by the day.  \r\nIf I need to move homes in order to be in an area where I will be offered some sort of care, then I will do so. But I need help in identifying which area would be best.  \r\nMy biggest worry is that I will end up being disabled due to having no care and management. Which ultimately would cost a lot more as I would not be able to continue to work.  \r\nThrowing pain medication at me is not a solution and will only make matters worse as these are addictive.  \r\nI am so disillusioned and disappointed with the lack of interest shown by NHS staff, the red tape which is not allowing me access to hearing aid repairs and supplies, the hours that I have spent on the phone trying to get help, and not even getting through to a person. Where do I turn to now? If there is a Dr anywhere in the UK that specialises in Ehlers Danlos, I would love to know about it, so that I can get the help that I need.","criticality":"moderately

They took me straight to fracture clinic so I didn’t have to wait in A and E.  \r\nIn fracture clinic everyone was so kind and thoughtful. Similarly in X-ray. Although my leg was painful all handling was done carefully and tactfully with appropriate pain relief. I was seen by the doctor on call, who explained everything and a plaster cast was applied. I was then offered a cup of tea and some biscuits which were so welcome!  \r\nI transferred to the ward and had surgery to insert a very big nail the following day. Again everyone was thoughtful and explained everything. I did feel quite nauseous after the anaesthetic but that passed after a few days.  \r\nDoctors checked on my leg regularly through all this time to make sure my circulation and nerves weren’t compromised.  \r\nI was on the ward for 4 days. With no visitors allowed, I was extremely grateful for the support and chat form the lovely HCAs on the ward who were so kind. Not just to me but in particular to another elderly patient who was confused at times. It was very moving to see how kindly her confusion was managed, by talking to her and keeping her company, and I only wish her family could have seen this. No one could wish for more for their relative.  \r\n4 months on, my leg is well healed. The scars are fading fast and I’m sure will be scarcely visible in a few months. I am back to my normal very active life, for which I will always be eternally grateful.  \r\nI have been lucky and needed very little help from the NHS throughout my life, but when I needed help it was there. I cannot fault any of my care and that despite being ill in a pandemic. Best of all, it’s free!  \r\nWe must all cherish this very special service and keep it free for everyone.  \r\nI would like to say a massive thank you to everyone who was involved in my care.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-02-02T21:37:26.8866667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-02-08T11:55:03.267","readBy":[{"name":"Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board","count":1},{"name":"Welsh Ambulance Services NHS Trust","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/819954","id":"819954"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/819954/responses","id":"819954"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/819954/healthservices","id":"819954"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/819954/tags","id":"819954"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/7a1a4","id":"7A1A4","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rt4","id":"RT4","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/access%20to%20pain%20relief","id":"access to pain relief"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anaesthetic","id":"Anaesthetic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/broken","id":"broken"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/broken%20leg","id":"broken leg"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/circulation","id":"circulation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/elderly","id":"elderly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/elderly%20patient","id":"elderly patient"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fibula","id":"fibula"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fracture","id":"fracture"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/leg","id":"leg"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lovely","id":"lovely"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lucky","id":"lucky"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain%20relief","id":"pain relief"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/paramedics","id":"paramedics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/plaster","id":"plaster"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professional","id":"professional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scars","id":"scars"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thoughtful","id":"thoughtful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tibia","id":"tibia"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/x-ray","id":"X-ray"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/explanations","id":"explanations"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/offered%20refreshments","id":"offered refreshments"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pandemic","id":"pandemic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/plaster%20cast","id":"plaster cast"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/820420","id":"820420"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/820485","id":"820485"}]},{"id":820229,"author":"Lemon Nelly","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"My Mum","body":"My Mum was in AAU and ward A32. &nbsp;

Most of us is embarrassed to go and get checked as it’s not a pleasant and comfortable subject but Susan made me feel so relaxed. I think this is the way forward now Great work! &nbsp;","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-02-05T20:23:20.4633333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-02-08T13:37:12.79","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Fife","count":13},{"name":"Fife Health & Social Care Partnership","count":4}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/820254","id":"820254"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/820254/responses","id":"820254"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/820254/healthservices","id":"820254"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/820254/tags","id":"820254"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sf9-sexual-health","id":"SF9-Sexual-Health","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good","id":"good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helpful","id":"helpful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/privacy","id":"privacy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sexual%20health","id":"sexual health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sti","id":"sti"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/understanding","id":"understanding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/relaxed","id":"relaxed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pandemic","id":"pandemic"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/820750","id":"820750"}]},{"id":820255,"author":"RelievedMum","authorRoleId":3,"authorRole":"a parent/guardian","title":"Teen Rheumatology","body":"Today my daughter was signed off from treatment at the hospital's teen rheumatology department,  \r\nHer care has been excellent, the staff (nurses, doctors, consultants) have all been incredibly professional and friendly, explaining things in good detail, answering all our questions.
