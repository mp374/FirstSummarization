When he refused unsuitable food he was told he was too fussy and should stop moaning.

I was unable to visit him to take him any food due to my own ill health. I am disgusted that he was being treated in this way and very upset.

He was admitted on a Wednesday and was in this bed space for 2 days. He is not going anywhere as is awaiting an Angiogram.  \r\nBesides the issue he had no privacy or dignity, he was also blocking a fire door. How is this safe?  \r\nThe staff are amazing and clearly working under massive pressure. None of them seem to think it is a good idea but I have spoken to them and they are unable to move him when a normal bed becomes available ( which many have) as he is the most stable patient in the bay. I appreciate this but what happens if he does have a heart attack? There are no oxygen or suction points, and no call bell.  \r\nHe wanted to change his pyjama bottoms having been in hospital for 3 days and had to stand in the middle of the bay in his underpants. I attempted to close the patient nearest hims curtains to give him some kind of dignity but the patient was not very happy. I explained my Dad has no curtains of his own. My Dad is fully competent and has full capacity -but is breathless and experiencing chest pain whenever he moves so needs some of his own space and privacy.  \r\nHe witnessed another patient having a cardiac arrest on his first night and was able to tell me every detail - how is patient confidentiality being maintained when one bed is within centimetres of another.  \r\nPrivacy, dignity, confidentiality are these not our code of conduct. Please tell me how this has been allowed to happen.  \r\nI re-iterate all the staff have been wonderful and so kind to Dad but they shouldn't be working in these conditions either.

My doctor refers me back to yourselves and won’t answer queries.  \r\nPhone consultation has been arranged again, I already spent time explaining it doesn’t work for me due to my autistic processing, I miss 80% of the conversation and am constantly playing catch up. It would be far better to bear the lighting (upsets my nervous system) and come in if I were allowed to voice record and had questions put to me in advance to allow thinking time.  \r\nI take at least 3 x as long as neurotypicals to think things through. It appears you don’t take what I say about my neuro-difference at all seriously but communication fails if in modes I cant use.  \r\nThe haematologist I spoke to Friday (I don't have a name as it was a phone call and I could not take notes and listen) said I would have bloods taken asap as I’ve started chemotherapy( hydroxycarbamide) on Friday as advised but I have had no date or venue for the test.  \r\nWhen I called today the haematology secretary said an appointment had been made on 8/3 but gave no time or venue. As she predicted an appointment arrived by post but not for bloods, for a phone consult which is not what haematologist on duty had said. See above re phone consults. not ideal at all. i’m concerned re bloods as I will need time off work and to arrange staff cover for me which takes notice. If its imminent I need to know when/where.  \r\nI am also concerned re the side effects of the tablets. At present I have alternate pill days I cannot function on as I am too dizzy to do responsible work or to drive. I am exhausted, in bed by 6pm after a dose. The following day I am nauseous and weak, i missed 3 breakfasts so far when I usually eat and have my losartan and aspirin now I cannot. So aspirin is on an empty stomach. I cant think clearly, lose my balance and struggle to carry anything at work. less than ideal with a physical job.  \r\nI did say i was chemically sensitive and my dna analysis says detoxing is difficult. In 2020 I was close to suicide over the effects of amlodipine which caused me pain and the amitriptyline given to counter that blanked my brain so I couldn’t think, not going there again!

I was told someone would call back but nothing so far (end of working day, promise made in morning). i am hoping my mobile was tried as I work on a broad site and house phone is little use unless i am in the office(minority of time).","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-02-28T15:24:32.7266667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-03-01T09:33:32.397","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Ayrshire & Arran","count":3}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1035782","id":"1035782"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1035782/responses","id":"1035782"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1035782/healthservices","id":"1035782"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1035782/tags","id":"1035782"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/a201h","id":"A201H","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/should%20listen","id":"Should listen"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/autistic","id":"autistic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/chemotherapy","id":"chemotherapy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/haematology","id":"haematology"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1037227","id":"1037227"}]},{"id":1035109,"author":"Patient531","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Kind and excellent care every step of the way","body":"I was recently admitted to the day surgery unit at Queen Margaret Hospital, Dunfermline for a knee arthroscopy under general anaesthetic.  \r\nI couldn't be more grateful for the excellent standard of care I received every step of the way, from my very first appointment at the orthopaedic surgery clinic to being discharged home after the arthroscopy.  \r\nWhat an incredible team of professionals.

Thank you.","body":"My elderly mother was taken to hospital two weeks ago suffering from pneumonia. She was taken immediately into A&E upon arrival by ambulance. The A & E staff were absolutely amazing. They allowed me in to sit with my mum who was very confused and anxious.  \r\nI previously posted about poor communication last year.  \r\nCommunication in the Ulster Hospital has been absolutely fantastic. The contrast is astonishing. I was contacted by A & E to tell me when they had found a bed for my mum in ward 3A and that they would be moving her that day. I got a phone call later from the ward to tell me that my mum had arrived and that they were getting her settled. I was given information about her current status and visiting at that point. Each time something was done with my mum, the hospital contacted us to let us know in advance.  \r\nAll of the staff on ward 3a were incredibly helpful and engaged. It was never too much trouble for them to check the records and give us an update, even when my mum was not under their particular care. If they said they were going to ring us, they did. It was such a relief and reassurance to us. Even my mum, who can be a bit tetchy at times, spoke highly of those who cared for her.  \r\nI know how much pressure all staff are under in the NHS yet never were we made to feel that they were too busy and did not have time to deal with us. The same in A&E, despite the frantic pace in there. I can't sing their praises highly enough.

The nurse tested my blood sugar and ketones and she was instantly concerned and phoned the Diabetes centre in Kirkcaldy and they advised I should go straight there. That day I was seen by Jeanette and she asked if I had anyone with me, I said my partner was in the car he had driven me to the hospital. Jeanette kindly insisted I asked my partner to come in to the room with us for support because there was a lot of information I was about to be told! This meant a lot to myself and my partner and we really appreciate being allowed to do this.  \r\nJeanette was very caring and friendly as she talked us through everything we needed to know. Jeanette set me up with a Libre 2 on this first day of diagnosis which was such an amazing help to make things that little bit easier. She also gave me her mobile number and even when she was off work at the weekend, on those first few scary days she was at the other end of the phone for me and always happy to help with any questions and helping me with insulin dosing.  \r\nIn my first couple of weeks of diagnosis I also had a couple of appointments with Jill, a dietitian who was amazingly supportive and helpful too. Jill got me to count carbohydrates from day one so that she could work out my ratios and was very supportive in me continuing a completely normal diet, not restricting myself which was obviously a big worry when you first hear the diagnosis of diabetes! During all my appointments over the first few weeks, whether they were over the phone, over video or in person, both Jill and Jeanette made everything as easy as I could possibly imagine and I felt extremely supported and felt I was getting plenty of information.  \r\nWhenever I've sent any emails they have always been answered quickly and I've always been satisfied with the help I've received when I've needed it. I recently reached out to Jeanette via email after having problems with my Libre sensors/App not working very well. Jeanette quickly signed me up to the next available date to get started on the Dexcom G6 instead. I had previously been discussing changing to Dexcom with other nurses Fiona and Jenny however I never heard anything further after trying to chase this up a few weeks prior. When I expressed an interest in moving onto an insulin pump, Jeanette was very supportive of this. She made sure I got an appointment quickly with a consultant who could then start the process onto to the next step.  \r\nI soon after started omnipod dash and got great support from Fiona in the weeks after my training and setup. There has only ever been one appointment at the Diabetes centre where I left feeling slightly deflated, a few weeks after starting on Omnipod I was there for a follow up appointment with Jenny. I was feeling really positive about the appointment because I had been trying hard to keep my blood sugars in range and my libre data at this point was 90% in range over the last 2 weeks which I was really pleased with myself for, and Fiona had been very pleased with similar results at my previous appointment. Jenny didn't log in to my libre data that day, she downloaded my pump data and she expressed disappointment that according to my pump my blood sugar was around 70% in range. I tried to say that my libre time in range was much higher and that my libre captures all data whereas my pump only captures the data I enter, when doing corrections when my blood sugar is high, but the focus seemed to be on looking for places for improvement which I understand, and of course appreciate the help and encouragement however I was just a bit deflated to not receive praise for my decent efforts!  \r\nOn the whole, my experience with the Kirkcaldy Diabetes centre over the last year and a half has been very positive and I'm very grateful to have such a great team available to me whenever I need them.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-02-24T21:18:48.7866667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-03-01T09:46:22.817","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Fife","count":4}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1034677","id":"1034677"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1034677/responses","id":"1034677"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1034677/healthservices","id":"1034677"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1034677/tags","id":"1034677"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/f704h-diabetes-endocrinology","id":"f704h-diabetes-endocrinology","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20sugar","id":"blood sugar"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/caring","id":"caring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diabetes","id":"diabetes"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diagnosis","id":"diagnosis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dietician","id":"Dietician"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly%20staff","id":"friendly staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helpful","id":"helpful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/information","id":"information"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/informed","id":"informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/insulin","id":"insulin"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/insulin%20pump","id":"insulin pump"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ketones","id":"ketones"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/positive","id":"positive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported","id":"supported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diabetes%20type%201","id":"diabetes type 1"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/explanations","id":"explanations"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/great%20team","id":"great team"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/questions%20answered","id":"questions answered"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1036317","id":"1036317"}]},{"id":1035260,"author":"ORB Admin","authorRoleId":8,"authorRole":"a staff member posting for a patient/service user","title":"They have showed me that help is out there.","body":"First I was nervous and very anxious but now I'm very glad I started here at Bucks One Recovery.

From initial GP appointment when referral was made, things have progressed steadily forward with another step along the way each week. First an ultrasound, then a consultants appointment, carried out at the local community hospital in Ards. Close to home & very accessible. And treated with the utmost care & respect.  \r\nNext a CT scan at the Downe. So swift and efficient yet carried out in a professional, caring & unhurried manner. Next a double endoscopy. This appointment was brought forward and arranged by telephone by Nathan. My aunt had been praying that she would get an answer about her diagnosis & a plan. When the call from Nathan came she was so incredibly grateful & relieved to get an appointment in just 2 days time. Nathan went by far above & beyond to ensure that she received the medication she needed prior to the procedure & dropped it off with her on his way home. Outstanding.  \r\nOn the morning of the appointment we were greeted at the Endoscopy Day Procedure Unit in the Ulster Hospital by a very friendly, cheerful and professional member of the team on the front desk. We were directed to the spacious & comfortable waiting area. Busy, with lots of patients, but not cramped or crowded. After a short wait the loveliest nurse, Pat, brought my aunt through to be admitted. Her manner & tone were perfect.  \r\nThe procedures involved were to be unpleasant but everything was clearly explained & described in a comprehensive, bright & user friendly way. Very important when someone is feeling anxious. My aunt was put at ease & was managed warmly & caringly and I felt 100% confident (& incredibly appreciative) that the staff were so professional & empathic.  \r\nWhilst waiting for the procedures to be completed, other patients kept coming. All were greeted with the same warm & friendly attitude and brought through by nursing staff who were so relentlessly bright, warm & attentive. The level of care received at the outset of a daunting appointment & when being escorted back out to family members anxiously waiting to bring patients home couldn’t be more highly commended. Gold standard!! Outstanding. Thank you isn’t quite enough, but thank you all the same.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-02-25T14:43:06.1166667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-03-01T10:21:43","readBy":[{"name":"South Eastern Health and Social Care Trust","count":8}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1034750","id":"1034750"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1034750/responses","id":"1034750"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1034750/healthservices","id":"1034750"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1034750/tags","id":"1034750"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt004_07020","id":"ZT004_07020","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt004_07021-mdcu","id":"zt004_07021-mdcu","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt004_14028-radiology","id":"zt004_14028-radiology","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt004_14028-radiology-ct","id":"zt004_14028-radiology-CT","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/above%20and%20beyond","id":"above and beyond"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/caring","id":"caring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ct","id":"ct"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ct%20scan","id":"CT scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diagnosis","id":"diagnosis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/efficient","id":"efficient"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/endoscopy","id":"Endoscopy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/important","id":"important"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurse","id":"nurse"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/outstanding%20care","id":"Outstanding care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professional","id":"professional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/quick%20service","id":"quick service"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reception","id":"reception"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/respect","id":"respect"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/safe","id":"safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scan","id":"scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ultrasound","id":"ultrasound"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting%20area","id":"waiting area"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appreciative","id":"appreciative"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20for","id":"cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cheerful","id":"cheerful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confident","id":"confident"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/impressed","id":"impressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/relieved","id":"relieved"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/valued","id":"valued"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/explanations","id":"explanations"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/empathic","id":"empathic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20at%20ease","id":"put at ease"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fully%20informed","id":"fully informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20warmth","id":"staff warmth"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1037396","id":"1037396"}]},{"id":1035287,"author":"Ms Mc 140","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Our experience was excellent throughout our stay","body":"My husband needed to attend for assessment due to his cardiac condition and was assessed and treated promptly by the amazing medical and nursing team on site.

Moreover, I feel extremely safe on this ward, I didn’t mind the lack of visiting throughout the pandemic as I was able to speak to my family on the phone and see them through the window. It was scary to be diagnosed with leukaemia and worrying about people bringing bugs in, so I felt very safe with the no visiting rule.  \r\nI have previously attended the Macmillan outpatient clinic here in Craigavon and the staff there are brilliant and have been really supportive for both me and my family.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-02-25T16:24:01.61","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-03-01T10:29:46.917","readBy":[{"name":"Southern Health and Social Care Trust","count":4}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1034761","id":"1034761"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1034761/responses","id":"1034761"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1034761/healthservices","id":"1034761"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1034761/tags","id":"1034761"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_32024_303","id":"ZT003_32024_303","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing%20staff","id":"amazing staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/haematology","id":"haematology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/involved","id":"involved"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/leukaemia","id":"leukaemia"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/macmillan","id":"Macmillan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/safe","id":"safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/teamwork","id":"teamwork"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported","id":"supported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/listened%20to","id":"listened to"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1039830","id":"1039830"}]},{"id":1035631,"author":"Shagq75","authorRoleId":8,"authorRole":"a staff member posting for a patient/service user","title":"The level of care I am getting is so good","body":"Female medical has been really good.

Pauline and Kirsty were lovely to talk to and my husband and I are still talking about how blissful those first hours were. They even came up to see us on the post natal ward to congratulate us as they had gone by the time I delivered. We’ll never forget yous!!  \r\nThanks also to midwife Mary. She was there for me when things became more difficult- she was great too and amazing in an emergency.  \r\nI ended up needing a forcep delivery- at this stage I was exhausted and upset and I met so many people in theatre that I can’t remember by name but they all were amazing at a difficult time. I wish I knew the name of the male nurse who tried his best to keep me and my husband upbeat. He was lovely and left a lasting impression.  \r\nI think the lady anaesthetist was called Catherine - she had a lovely personality and even made me smile. A very special thanks to Dr Nordon- she came to the rescue and as a result I had a straightforward forcep delivery and recovery has also be straightforward. I owe the life of my wee boy to her. She came up to the ante natal ward the following night to check on us which meant the world to me. She even offered advice from one mother to another.  \r\nThank you so much!!

The new system allows you only to make an emergency appointment on the day you call the practice.  \r\nThe practice phone lines opens at 8:15 am, what is a very busy time of the day for many people who are either getting their children ready for school or commuters getting ready to go to work. Most of the time the line are engaged until about 8:45 am - 9 am and when your call is taken most of the appointments of the day are taken and you are requested to phone again the next day. If you are able to book an appointment you need to tell the receptionist the reason for your call, then the GP will phone you back during the day at any of his/her desired time. As a patient you are not allowed to request a time/time slot; after the phone call with the GP, the GP will make the decision if he/she want to see you in person. This whole process can take a couple of days, as sometimes the GP does not call back until after 4:00 pm and an appointment has to be made for the next or another day.  \r\nThe system is undermining peoples health condition because of the requirement that you are only allowed to make an emergency appointment. Instead of preventing a health or wellbeing issues of becoming more serious, they only allow you to make an appointment when the situation is getting out of control.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-02-26T18:33:16.6","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-03-01T11:11:30.077","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Ayrshire & Arran","count":4}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1034957","id":"1034957"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1034957/responses","id":"1034957"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1034957/healthservices","id":"1034957"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1034957/tags","id":"1034957"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sa9-gp","id":"sa9-gp","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frustrated","id":"frustrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appointment%20system","id":"appointment system"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gp%20surgery","id":"gp surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/prevention","id":"prevention"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/telephone%20booking","id":"telephone booking"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unhappy","id":"unhappy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid","id":"covid"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1037314","id":"1037314"}]},{"id":1035129,"author":"attendantpe46","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Poor treatment","body":"I am unhappy about my experience in the injuries dept.

The nurse told me to get up and put weight on my leg, walk like I was healthy, even though I am obese so I should not put too much pressure on the ankle. I feel disgusted as I have a sprained ankle and the guidelines on the NHS website state not to put weight on the leg. I was not given any prescription, just a recommendation to take painkillers.

I would like to thank everyone involved in my husband's treatment and care. I know that they did everything they could to keep him as safe, comfortable and pain-free as possible. They all exhibited a quality no amount of training can provide - compassion. Thank you all for your excellent care of us both.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2023-02-28T23:28:28","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-03-01T11:21:56","readBy":[{"name":"Torbay and South Devon NHS Foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1036235","id":"1036235"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1036235/responses","id":"1036235"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1036235/healthservices","id":"1036235"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1036235/tags","id":"1036235"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/ra901","id":"RA901","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ct","id":"ct"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ct%20scan","id":"CT scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/heart","id":"heart"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/heart%20attack","id":"heart attack"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/in%20pain","id":"in pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/involved","id":"involved"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lungs","id":"lungs"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pneumonia","id":"pneumonia"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/safe","id":"safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scan","id":"scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/xray","id":"Xray"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20safe","id":"very safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/comfortable","id":"comfortable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/like%20myself","id":"like myself"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1043632","id":"1043632"}]},{"id":1036237,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Great GP Appointment ","body":"Really impressed with friendly staff, efficient service and response of GP, \nGreat two way discussion to support diagnosis and agree treatment plan.

My last visit was like a whirlwind. I phoned daycare as I checked my blood pressure at home and it was really high and spoke to Toni who looked after me at each visit. I didn’t want to attend as I felt I was just being paranoid but Toni persuaded me to attend to get checked over. When I arrived Toni started doing my blood pressure and put the heart trace on so she could monitor my baby which was all fine but Toni told me my blood pressure was up and needed to take blood.  \r\nAs I was talking to her she asked if I felt more swollen in my face as she could see a bit of difference from previous visits. I mentioned my parter said the same and I had pain in my right shoulder going through to my back which developed throughout the night and that morning. My blood pressure was really high and I had to get medication to try and lower it. Toni was calm and was talking to me and her student Isobel who was lovely (and will be a fantastic midwife when qualified) exactly what she was doing and why as she thought I was developing pre eclampsia.  \r\nMy blood pressure was not settling and remained high and I had to be admitted for closer monitoring and had to have stronger medication through a drip. The staff in labour ward were amazing also and I had to deliver my gorgeous boy I think it was about 4 hours after being admitted due to pre eclampsia. I just want to say thank you to toni especially for persuading me to attend and keeping me calm and explaining everything to me. I was told by the doctors if I stayed at home I could have become really unwell so thank you.  \r\n4 weeks down the line my son and I are doing a lot better and I am so grateful to everyone that looked after us so well from day care, labour ward and ward 8.

We all felt also by half way through that we felt comfortable asking the nurses questions about our own condition and how we felt that day or week. It was encouraging to hear others, not only the nurses, sympathising and encouraging each other.I am also pleased that they do a referral to the local gym and exercise classes where I can now get a discount for a period of time to join and a bespoke training system if I attend as the health details that are relevant are passed on to the local exercise centre so they can advise on the best exercises for me.Would recommend doing this class even if some of the talks given are not relevant to you, eg for me that was smoking advice.The only thing that could be improved is if they did a follow up in 6 month time.","criticality":"minimally critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-02-27T16:46:47.1833333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-03-01T13:11:29.417","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Forth Valley","count":4}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1035293","id":"1035293"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1035293/responses","id":"1035293"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1035293/healthservices","id":"1035293"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1035293/tags","id":"1035293"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/forth-valley-royal-respiratory","id":"forth-valley-royal-respiratory","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/asthma","id":"asthma"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/copd","id":"copd"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/encouraging","id":"encouraging"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/exercise","id":"exercise"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/follow%20up","id":"follow up"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/group","id":"group"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/peer%20support","id":"peer support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/physio","id":"physio"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/respiratory","id":"respiratory"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/walk","id":"walk"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/walking","id":"walking"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pleased","id":"pleased"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/educational","id":"Educational"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/motivating","id":"motivating"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/time%20for%20questions","id":"time for questions"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/motivated","id":"motivated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/zoom","id":"zoom"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1059386","id":"1059386"}]},{"id":1035294,"author":"Chereid","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Telephone waiting times to book an appointment","body":"I have been waiting on 2 separate calls today for 1.5 hours to speak to someone in an appointment office with no answer.

We had a bit of a wait on arrival at the hospital, but they kept an eye on mum and made us aware of what was happening.  \r\nMum was eventually moved to an assessment area as she was next in the queue and I had to leave her there and go to the waiting room. I was told I would be allowed to rejoin her as soon as she was in a cubicle, but unfortunately this didn’t happen and we were separated for several hours which given her age(late eighties) and very poor hearing was stressful for us both.  \r\nHaving said that, mum was well looked after and had blood tests and a scan and when she asked the doctor about where I was he came to the waiting area and called me through.  \r\nBy this time we were told that it did seem to be a TIA and while the scan looked pretty good she would be kept in for observation at least overnight. Our only other concern at this point was that mum had nothing to eat or drink apart from a few sips of coffee.  \r\nAfter another wait we were moved to the ward, but unfortunately a room wasn’t ready so we had a wait in the corridor where a lovely member of staff who had been cleaning in the area offered and brought us tea/coffee and biscuits which were very much appreciated.  \r\nOnce we got into the room a nurse came and completed paperwork on mum’s abilities/existing conditions and I left her eating her dinner.  \r\nOvernight mum had observations done and was relatively comfortable.  \r\nDuring her stay she was amazed and impressed by the treatment she received by every member of staff she encountered, everyone was friendly and took time to talk to her despite her hearing difficulties. She also said the food was excellent compared to what she had experienced in previous hospital stays.  \r\nAs a family, our only issue was lack of information as we couldn’t get through to the ward for an update and nobody called with any information. Mum is unable to use a mobile phone but did manage to communicate through her tablet which we had linked to hospital WiFi. She believed someone had called us with an update.  \r\nAll in all we would like to thank everyone for looking after mum so well and particular thanks to staff nurse Nicola who explained everything to us on discharge, re-attached her tablet to the WiFi, listened to her life story (at least once) and chatted to her about the football. Also to a doctor (whose name I’ve forgotten) who was able to update me on what was going on during a visit.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-02-27T17:00:37.6166667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-03-01T13:21:22.423","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":9},{"name":"Scottish Ambulance Service","count":5}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1035298","id":"1035298"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1035298/responses","id":"1035298"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1035298/healthservices","id":"1035298"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1035298/tags","id":"1035298"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/scot-ambulance-emergency","id":"scot-ambulance-emergency","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sj9-south-glasgow-hospital-aru","id":"SJ9-south-glasgow-hospital-aru","score":4},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stressed","id":"stressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ambulance","id":"ambulance"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20tests","id":"blood tests"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctor","id":"doctor"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/food","id":"food"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hearing","id":"hearing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/information","id":"information"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lovely%20staff","id":"lovely staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/quick%20response","id":"quick response"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20nurse","id":"staff nurse"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tea%20and%20biscuits","id":"tea and biscuits"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tia","id":"tia"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/well%20looked%20after","id":"well looked after"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appreciated","id":"appreciated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/impressed","id":"impressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication%20with%20family","id":"communication with family"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ambulance%20staff","id":"ambulance staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/explanations","id":"explanations"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kept%20updated","id":"kept updated"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1037223","id":"1037223"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1038623","id":"1038623"}]},{"id":1035304,"author":"hearthammer 1","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Rehabilitation care package","body":"I was referred to the cardiology team at HH due to breathing issues when walking and exercising, I attended various assessment clinics until I was referred to Dr Carrick, who carried out a heart catheterisation procedure and I was told that due to the severe flattening of my arteries, a stent procedure could not be done.

This was sent off for testing.  \r\nAll in all a professional experience.  \r\nThanks Nicol.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-02-27T17:56:49.7433333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-03-01T13:24:54.563","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Tayside","count":11}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1035311","id":"1035311"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1035311/responses","id":"1035311"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1035311/healthservices","id":"1035311"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1035311/tags","id":"1035311"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/t101h_370","id":"T101H_370","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/antibiotics","id":"antibiotics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bloods","id":"bloods"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/chest","id":"chest"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/courtesy","id":"courtesy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/efficient","id":"efficient"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/positive","id":"positive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professional","id":"professional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/timely","id":"timely"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/listened%20to","id":"listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/immunotherapy","id":"immunotherapy"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1044690","id":"1044690"}]},{"id":1035621,"author":"Alexe98","authorRoleId":8,"authorRole":"a staff member posting for a patient/service user","title":"I cannot thank the team enough","body":"I can't thank the team enough for everything they have done for me.
