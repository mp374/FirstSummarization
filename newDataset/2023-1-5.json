We had to call an ambulance for him on two separate occasions over Christmas and New Year.  \r\nThe ambulance crews were extremely caring and thorough. They took time to consider his history, ailments, medication etc. of which there are many! He was taken to Antrim Area Hospital, straight into resuscitation. I was then able to stay with him for most of next couple of days. In terms of the ED, the care and compassion provided by ED Consultant Emer to both me and him was outstanding. He was then moved to Ward B2 where he continued to receive the same wonderful standard of care from nursing staff, pharmacy, podiatry, wound care etc. Despite one extremely challenging patient subjecting them to continuous harassment and abuse. On a number of occasions the other patient hurled items at them; truly appalling to watch.It is staggering that that HSC staff continue to give such an exemplary standard of care, given all the pressures that they are under.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-01-04T10:43:15.7233333","progress":"Story has a

I was at Arbroath for 10 and a half hours. I was attended to the whole time by 3 nurses who were continuously phoning the ambulance to take me to Ninewells Hospital. They were told that the ambulance had been dispatched 3 times, but the ambulances had been redirected to other casualties.  \r\nThe 3 nurses taking care of me, Jen, Sarah, and Debbie continuously contacted Ninewells and Kings Cross Hospital to let them know the ambulance had not arrived and that I was considered an emergency. This went on for a while. During this time, I told the nurses that I was in a considerable amount of lower back pain because of how long I had been lying on the trolley. Jen contacted the consultant at Ninewells to check whether I could be moved. The consultant agreed I could be moved to a 45-degree angle to help alleviate the pain and this did make my back pain feel better.  \r\nArbroath closed at 8:00pm and the nurses kept calling Ninewells and Kings Cross (where their managers were) to let them know. The management team there agreed to send two palliative care nurses over from Dundee to replace the nurses who had been looking after me as their shift was due to end.  \r\nIt had passed the closing point of 8:00pm and at about 10:00pm there was a call to say that an ambulance was 21 minutes away. It got to midnight and the two palliative care nurses had not arrived and the 3 nurses looking after me had stopped on their shift an additional 4 hours.  \r\nAt 12:20am, the two palliative care nurses had arrived with the ambulance. The ambulance staff told me that a spare ambulance had been taken out of service. And I think the Kings Cross management team had left it too late to make a decision about replacing the nurses. At 12:40am we set off to Dundee.  \r\nWe arrived at Dundee, and I was physically sick - concussion had started when I was moved from the ambulance at Ninewells. I was then taken to resus to get help from them because I was still immobilised from being strapped up. After this, I then entered a queue for A&E and eventually I had my blood pressure checked.  \r\nI was admitted to Ninewells A&E at 1:45am and after being checked over by a nurse, I wasn’t seen until 8:45am when I was sent for a brain scan and told everything was ok. I was discharged about 2 hours after this. The consultants at Ninewells were all aware that I was coming as per numerous telephone calls from Jen, Sarah, and Debbie. So why did it take 7 hours to attend me?  \r\nWhat I would like to say next is that the 3 nurses at Arbroath went above and beyond the call of duty and couldn’t do anymore for me -they were fantastic and continuously phoned consultants, managers, and the ambulance. They should be recognised for their work because what happened wasn’t fair on them and wasn’t far on me.  \r\nI was lying there for 17 hours in total waiting to be seen-this was an emergency and I don’t understand how it took so long. This was a very difficult experience, and I don’t want this to happen to anyone again.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-01-04T11:26:26.6166667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-01-05T09:04:32.907","readBy":[{"name":"Scottish Ambulance Service","count":12},{"name":"NHS Tayside","count":17},{"name":"Angus Health and Social Care Partnership","count":3}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1013946","id":"1013946"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1013946/responses","id":"1013946"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1013946/healthservices","id":"1013946"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1013946/tags","id":"1013946"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/scot-ambulance-emergency","id":"scot-ambulance-emergency","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/t101h_180","id":"T101H_180","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/t304h_110","id":"T304H_110","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/above%20and%20beyond","id":"above and beyond"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ambulance","id":"ambulance"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back%20pain","id":"back pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20pressure","id":"blood pressure"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fall","id":"fall"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/minor%20injuries","id":"minor injuries"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wait%20times","id":"wait times"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting","id":"waiting"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fantastic","id":"fantastic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/beyond%20the%20call%20of%20duty","id":"beyond the call of duty"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1014326","id":"1014326"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1014329","id":"1014329"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1014533","id":"1014533"}]},{"id":1013952,"author":"sambatk77","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Advocacy provided at short notice","body":"My advocate is Peter.

Just before Christmas. I was taken after waiting half an hour for the ambulance, to Raigmore Hospital A&E. Fortunately, as I was to discover, there was a space for me immediately in the department. I was treated in a timely and courteous manner by the staff. I could see they were very busy. My husband was able to come in, which helped. I was then x-rayed, processed and sent to a Trauma & Orthapeadic ward, when it was discovered that I had broken my femur.  \r\nThere I had to wait until the following day for my operation to fix my hip. I was in a ward that mostly had elderly people in, in various stages of trauma or recovery, the longest of which had been there for 4 months waiting to get home (they did just before Christmas).  \r\nI happily got my operation and was returned to the ward. During my few days on this ward I heard stories from patients about their journey through their trauma. One had not been discovered for about 10 hours in a sheltered housing complex. One had to wait 3 hours in an ambulance outside Raigmore. And another kept being told today was the day they would get their op after breaking her hip, but it took over 3 days.  \r\nThere was quite a few different members of staff when I was on this ward. They were on 12-hour shifts and they were understaffed at times due to staff phoning in sick. Throughout the time the ward was very noisy, but I was treated well, even though the staff did not have a lot of time to speak with the patients. Sometimes I found myself ringing my bell for others who could not, listening to them and in turn they were listening to me.  \r\nStaff did their best. After a couple of days I was transferred to a quieter ward in Gynae, where I was able to sleep better. I met more patients who had other stories to tell. Yet again there was a shortage of staff. I don't know if the staff in both wards were aware, but their conversations which they had with each other about themselves, other staff members or patients were able to be heard by all as they did not lower their voices, and it also contributed to the noise on occasion. Especially at night. But also I learned quite a lot!  \r\nThe food in Raigmore Hospital, to put it bluntly, was not very good. The ordering system did not seem to work very well and staff were struggling to get reception with their Ipad at times. There must be a better way. The quality of food was mostly poor, considering that people need good nutrition to get better, it was disappointing. Though I daresay this is to do with financial considerations. Quite a few people were vegetarian and kept getting asked about meat options. Would have thought there would be a better system for all. The staff did their best.  \r\nI observed that the staff did not always have the time or opportunity to pass on messages and patients would be asked the same question on a couple of occasions. I observed that staff sometimes spent time searching for misplaced items of equipment or charts because they were not put back in the appropriate places. Due to staff being distracted with an event or emergency. The staff did their best.  \r\nAs it was Christmas I do not know if it was any different from normal. They talked about changes in the new year and staff leaving. Staff did not seem settled and they seemed concerned. I was visited a few days after my op. Due to public holiday and busyness, I was given information which I maybe should have got the day after my op. I did get physiotherapy the day after my op, which was good.  \r\nI got home after the OT and physio signed me off. I received all the equipment I needed and medication for home. I was told I would be sent my discharge letter in the post, as they were busy at the time, and I was off!","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-01-04T11:39:12.08","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2023-01-05T09:19:56.06","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Highland","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1013950","id":"1013950"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1013950/responses","id":"1013950"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1013950/healthservices","id":"1013950"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1013950/tags","id":"1013950"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/h202h_110","id":"H202H_110","score":4},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/h202h_180","id":"H202H_180","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/h202h_502","id":"H202H_502","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disappointed","id":"disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/a&e","id":"a&e"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/broken%20hip","id":"broken hip"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency","id":"emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fall","id":"fall"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/femur","id":"femur"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/food","id":"food"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/more%20staff","id":"more staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nutrition","id":"nutrition"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/operation","id":"operation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/physiotherapy","id":"physiotherapy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/well%20treated","id":"well treated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/noisy%20ward","id":"noisy ward"}]},{"id":1013991,"author":"january23","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Disappointed with our treatment.","body":"Last year, my partner and I attended the EPAC, Ninewells where we learned we were miscarrying.  \r\nAt the appointment the midwife was very quiet and after about a minute reassured us that the first minute is always 'quiet'. She then told us there was no longer a heartbeat. Another midwife was called as the first midwife was unable to confirm that we were miscarrying. A few minutes later the second midwife arrived and performed the scan, with another midwife being called who shook her head and said I am sorry. We were advised a sonographer needed to also be called to confirm the miscarriage.  \r\nWhilst waiting for the sonographer the first midwife asked if we knew what was happening? My partner and I were fearing the worst and were certain we were miscarrying however were both very disappointed at how the midwives communicated with us at our appointment. It felt very dismissive of our emotions and as if we should have known what they were talking about. It wasn't until around 30 minutes after the appointment started that the second midwife said she was 99% sure that our pregnancy would not be continuing, however we would need to re-attend for a confirmation scan.  \r\nWe attended for the confirmation scan where we were told the pregnancy was not continuing and we were miscarrying. However, on arrival the unit was not set up properly and parts of the scanning equipment were missing and it was very unorganised. I appreciate there are a number of patients who will attend the department, however the midwife didn't appear to remember much about us and given how distressing the appointment was going to be we were again disappointed at the treatment.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-01-04T13:45:21.47","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-01-05T09:20:18.843","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Tayside","count":11}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1013991","id":"1013991"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1013991/responses","id":"1013991"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1013991/healthservices","id":"1013991"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1013991/tags","id":"1013991"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/t101h_501-epa","id":"T101H_501-EPA","score":3},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disappointed","id":"disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20upset","id":"very upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/customer%20care","id":"customer care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dismissed","id":"dismissed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/distressed","id":"distressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/midwives","id":"midwives"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/miscarriage","id":"miscarriage"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/organisation","id":"organisation"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1014328","id":"1014328"}]},{"id":1014002,"author":"Jolex93","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Registering a pregnancy","body":"It seems absolutely impossible to register a pregnancy in Teesside.

He then began to really struggle with his breathing and I took him to see my GP. His sats (oxygen) were lower than normal, and she agreed that he was struggling to breathe and rang through to Musgrove. They said for us to go straight to the PAU.  \r\nOn arriving at the PAU, we were seen straight away and my little boy was assessed. Luckily his sats were much better than with the GP, but he was still finding it hard to breathe, hadn't fed much or had a wet nappy that day. We were taken to a small private room and waited for the paediatrics doctor to see us. She was really thorough finding out what he had been like the days prior. She explained that it was likely to be bronchiolitis but we would need to wait for the swab result to be sure.  \r\nShe assessed him again and as his sats were okay she said that we would need to stay and be monitored but hopefully wouldn't need to be admitted. 5 hours later, we were allowed to go home, but the doctor explained what we needed to look for in terms of his condition getting worse. We were given a direct number to the PAU and a 48-hour window to use it if we were worried that his condition had deteriorated.  \r\nOnce home, his condition gradually improved and we didn't need to ring the number, but it was really reassuring to have it.  \r\nThe staff that saw us were brilliant and I couldn't have asked for a better service.

Every appointment has been either on time or I’ve been seen before my scheduled time, the nurses have been absolutely lovely and very gentle and caring.  My third appointment was firstly with a doctor who removed the wire, I was dreading the procedure expected some pain but I had absolutely none!  Then I had three X-rays and finally a consultation with another doctor who showed me before and after photos of my badly broken toe, he gave me lots of good advice on aftercare, showering, driving etc and said he’d call me in four weeks time.  How can I ask for more than that!  As a human race we are all very quick to complain but not quick enough to compliment.  I honestly couldn’t have received better care both at the Fracture Clinic and when I was being admitted for surgery!

Anyone feeling scared about going to a&e/urgent treatment centre, shouldn’t be, as you’ll be in good hands. \n ","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2023-01-04T22:46:21","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-01-05T10:06:10","readBy":[{"name":"East Suffolk and North Essex NHS Foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1014395","id":"1014395"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1014395/responses","id":"1014395"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1014395/healthservices","id":"1014395"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1014395/tags","id":"1014395"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rdee4","id":"RDEE4","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxious","id":"anxious"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20cared%20for","id":"not cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scared","id":"scared"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20upset","id":"very upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20about","id":"Cared about"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/in%20good%20hands","id":"in good hands"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20good","id":"not good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20scared","id":"not scared"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tests","id":"tests"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20for","id":"cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/feel%20at%20ease","id":"feel at ease"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/calmed","id":"calmed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20ease","id":"at ease"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/made%20to%20feel%20at%20ease","id":"made to feel at ease"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20at%20ease","id":"not at ease"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1014468","id":"1014468"}]},{"id":1014409,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Great service amongst an nhs crisis","body":"My son had a  allergic reaction to something and I had to take him to Children's a&e.

A nicer group of women you couldn't meet. They are so genuinely invested in your care and wellbeing, I was thrilled to see them coming for my antenatal appointments. They listened to my birth plan, answered many many of my questions, and equipped me with knowledge of what to expect and how to manage potentially arising issues. One massive plus for me was the continuity of care received from this small team - I met and knew all the midwives, so I felt comfortable with them and trusted them, which I felt would be very beneficial for the labour and birthing process.  \r\nUnfortunately due to unforeseen circumstances, I couldn't have my baby at home in the end. However, the homebirth team attended to me during early labour, and provided my aftercare. After a very traumatic hospital birth, I was really struggling to sleep and come to terms with what had happened, and the home birth team were a complete lifeline. They are one of the main reasons that I have been able to move on from the birth, recover physically and mentally, and focus on being the best mummy I can be. They were also an incredible support in establishing breastfeeding.  \r\nI honestly can't say enough good about this team and all they have done for our wee family. They hold a very special place in our hearts.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-01-04T17:49:40.53","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-01-05T10:24:47.837","readBy":[{"name":"Southern Health and Social Care Trust","count":4}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1014202","id":"1014202"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1014202/responses","id":"1014202"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1014202/healthservices","id":"1014202"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1014202/tags","id":"1014202"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003-baht","id":"zt003-baht","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/above%20and%20beyond","id":"above and beyond"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/aftercare","id":"aftercare"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/antenatal","id":"antenatal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/birth","id":"birth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breastfeeding%20support","id":"Breastfeeding Support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/caring","id":"caring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/continuity","id":"continuity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/continuity%20of%20care","id":"continuity of care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/expand%20service","id":"expand service"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/felt%20safe","id":"felt safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gentleness","id":"gentleness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/home%20visits","id":"home visits"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/knowledgeable","id":"knowledgeable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/labour","id":"labour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/midwives","id":"midwives"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nice%20staff","id":"nice staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/postnatal%20care","id":"postnatal care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pregnancy","id":"pregnancy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/prepared","id":"prepared"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/safe","id":"safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confident","id":"confident"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported","id":"supported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/comfortable","id":"comfortable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/listened%20to","id":"listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/questions%20answered","id":"questions answered"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breastfeeding%20advice","id":"breastfeeding advice"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/postpartum","id":"postpartum"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/postnatal%20support","id":"postnatal support"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1018082","id":"1018082"}]},{"id":1011995,"author":"suwyn","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"outpatient appt","body":"I had an outpatient appointment to see an orthopaedic doctor.

I live in Dundee but was in Edinburgh at the time.  \r\nI went to the Emergency Department at the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary and was redirected to minor injuries. I was seen within minutes by Leanne, a nurse practitioner. The wound was washed out with entonox for pain control, radiographs taken, antibiotics given, confirmation that a tetanus was not required, dressing placed and referral to the plastics unit at Ninewells Hospital.  \r\nA call was received from an StR Plastics within the next hour asking me to attend area 3A at 08:00 the next morning in Dundee. I did and further radiographs were taken. I was admitted, surgery was carried out for nerve repair, porcelain fragment removal and sutures to repair the wound (under LA) - StR Hilder.  \r\nI was discharged by 2:30pm the next day (under 24 hours). The whole team were excellent both within NHS Lothian and NHS Tayside - the receptionists, nurses, radiographers, porters, theatre staff and of course the surgeon. All were a credit to the NHS displaying all the values expected to a high level.

I first spoke to Tracy, who ascertained that I was in pain and my mobility was adversely affected. She called in Ellen, the podiatrist, who deemed my situation worthy of immediate attention. She skilfully and painlessly removed dead skin, finding a hole and an abscess, which she applied a poultice to and dressed.  \r\nMy frame of mind was dramatically improved by pleasant staff, happy to treat my problem, having spent a week being told to go away in a variety of different ways.

Nothing is a bother.  \r\nThe food is surprisingly good for hospital food.  \r\nI’m a Midwife so I know what to expect but even I can say everything has been absolutely fantastic.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-01-04T19:07:10.0166667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-01-05T10:49:29.46","readBy":[{"name":"Southern Health and Social Care Trust","count":6}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1014211","id":"1014211"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1014211/responses","id":"1014211"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1014211/healthservices","id":"1014211"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1014211/tags","id":"1014211"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_33020_501","id":"ZT003_33020_501","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_33020_501-delivery","id":"zt003_33020_501-delivery","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_33020_501-outpatients","id":"zt003_33020_501-outpatients","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_33020_501-ward","id":"zt003_33020_501-ward","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing%20staff","id":"amazing staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/antenatal","id":"antenatal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/delivery","id":"delivery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/encouraged","id":"encouraged"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/food","id":"food"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helpful","id":"helpful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/induction","id":"induction"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/maternity","id":"maternity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/midwives","id":"midwives"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nursing%20assistants","id":"Nursing Assistants"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/safe","id":"safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/warm","id":"warm"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/well%20cared%20for","id":"well cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing","id":"amazing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fantastic","id":"fantastic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happy","id":"happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported","id":"supported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wonderful","id":"wonderful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/great%20care","id":"Great care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/clean","id":"clean"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1014791","id":"1014791"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1016560","id":"1016560"}]},{"id":1014076,"author":"Kenedgey","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Poor service after waiting 6 months to see the surgeon","body":"I was due to have a face-to-face appointment, but this was changed to a telephone assessment 6 hour before my appointment.  \r\nThe surgeon agreed I needed surgery, but needs to see me to asses me first.

I have 2 small children and it is not ideal for me to wait in a walk in centre for hours on end. Today I was not able to reach the practice via telephone for my 3 year old daughter and consequently had to send my husband to physically attend the practice and urge for an appointment. I called the practice 108 times in total. Beyond ridiculous. I have also recently discovered that the doctor is not in on Wednesdays and on Thursdays the surgery closes early - how on earth are people meant to be seen? It is outright disgraceful.

The GP trainee doctor I saw and the senior nurse who looked after me during the night were so lovely, kind and caring.  \r\nThe Lochee midwives in Dundee were fantastic. In particular Lorna and Donna who were both kind and caring and helped me deal with my anxieties around pregnancy after a tragic experience a friend had.  \r\nI went up to maternity triage a couple of times and on both occasions saw Rachel who was also fabulous and put me at ease.  \r\nLorna explained to me the different birth options which greatly helped me make an informed decision when I was really unsure what to do. We decided on a c section. I couldn’t fault the care. The anaesthetist, Andrew, is the best doctor I have ever seen. He kept us calm and explained everything so well and made the whole experience a positive one. The midwife Logan was superb as were the obstetricians Dr Orr and Dr Suttie.  \r\nI went to a couple of antenatal classes in Dundee. The online one felt distant but the face to face one was superb. It was particularly good due to the small numbers and the encouragement by the midwife, Abbie, to make a WhatsApp group. This was life changing for me as to regularly meet these girls for a coffee settled my anxiety no end.  \r\nThank you all for such a positive experience.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-01-04T21:19:21.74","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-01-05T11:02:14.633","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Tayside","count":10}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1014224","id":"1014224"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1014224/responses","id":"1014224"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1014224/healthservices","id":"1014224"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1014224/tags","id":"1014224"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/t101h_501-cmu","id":"T101H_501-CMU","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/t101h_501-ls","id":"T101H_501-LS","score":5},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/t101h_501-mau","id":"T101H_501-MAU","score":3},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxious","id":"anxious"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anaesthetist","id":"anaesthetist"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/antenatal","id":"antenatal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/birth","id":"birth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/caring","id":"caring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gp","id":"GP"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hyperemesis","id":"hyperemesis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lovely%20staff","id":"lovely staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/maternity","id":"maternity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/midwives","id":"midwives"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurse","id":"nurse"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/obstetrician","id":"obstetrician"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pregnancy","id":"pregnancy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/triage","id":"triage"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/calm","id":"calm"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20for","id":"cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fantastic","id":"fantastic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happy","id":"happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/explanations","id":"explanations"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20at%20ease","id":"put at ease"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/faultless%20service","id":"faultless service"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20options","id":"given options"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%2019","id":"covid 19"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/keep%20small%20group%20sizes","id":"keep small group sizes"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/face-to-face","id":"face-to-face"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassurred","id":"reassurred"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kindness%20of%20staff","id":"kindness of staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20warmth","id":"staff warmth"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1014483","id":"1014483"}]},{"id":1014430,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Excellent care","body":"In mid-December 2022 my son had a partial thyroidectomy to remove a tumour.

I explained quietly to the receptionist and told her that I could not face waiting with no guarantee of being seen, I had done the right thing but ended up with no antibiotics , I am still unwell, two days later, no help, I was shocked at the lack of organisation and lack of planning with medical staff focusing on areas quite obviously being managed by the very nice receptionist.

Greeted by a Stroke Nurse and a stroke Doctor, I was immediately assessed and prepared in a professional, reassuring and efficient way.  I cannot comment on the clinical/medicinal side as I am not qualified, but as a patient, I was made to feel confident in those around me and totally at ease with the treatment I was recovering, a scan and further treatment before being taken to a ward, was efficient, and seemly seamless. Yes there was a small wait for bed and then transport to it, but hey, I was informed of everything and was made to feel relaxed about the whole thing.  The ward continued in the same vein, two nurses at any one time,  who would have done anything for me if I'd asked, I had food, water and was checked constantly.  A follow up scan the next day, visits by other Stroke Doctors, a physiotherapist who I want my granddaughter to emulate when she gets older, because she was so thorough but calming and reassuring at the same time.  Everyone, form the guy cleaning the bed and area before I could get in, it all the way up to the stroke Doctors and nurses, I cannot praise highly enough.  \n\nIf I was to have one criticism, it would be a lack of info when I was discharged, yes I had been given a stroke association pack, yes I had discharge papers and medicines, but what I would have liked, was five minutes with a Stroke Doctor or Nurse for last discharge advice, like, \"stay off work for two weeks\", \"don't drink alcohol\" or \"try and sleep more than usual\" or whatever might be relevant, even an A4 piece of paper with that information would have been welcomed, but maybe everyone is so different that's not possible, and if the stroke doctors and nurses are busy saving other people, then I get it.\nAll in all, what a fantastic set of work colleagues.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2023-01-04T19:29:57","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-01-05T11:08:41","readBy":[{"name":"Barts Health NHS Trust","count":1},{"name":"Ulster University, MBBS (Medicine) 2021","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1014448","id":"1014448"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1014448/responses","id":"1014448"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1014448/healthservices","id":"1014448"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1014448/tags","id":"1014448"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/r1h12","id":"R1H12","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/alcohol","id":"alcohol"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/informed","id":"informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/more%20confident","id":"more confident"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scan","id":"scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stroke","id":"stroke"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/welcomed","id":"welcomed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confident","id":"confident"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20ease","id":"at ease"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/in%20the%20way","id":"in the way"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20at%20ease","id":"not at ease"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/like%20myself","id":"like myself"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1014725","id":"1014725"}]},{"id":1014458,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Fantastic service ","body":"E consult at 08.30, GP thorough phone consultation at 10am and picked up prescription later that day.
