We were seen promptly and the friendly receptionist directed us to the children’s waiting area which my son loved with all the paintings on the walls and books to look at. We were soon seen by a nurse who took some details then the max fax doctor came and spoke to my son (who is very nervous and quite shy) and was really friendly, he was delighted as she gave him some stickers and a toy puzzle to play with and take home (little things make a 4 y olds day!). She explained the different options we had and we chose to stay and have stitches done there and then. I was really pleased with the way that everything was explained clearly and choices made very clear. Then we had to wait a while for the numbing gel to be applied then again waited for it to work, we were made comfortable , my little boy laid on the couch on me as he was nervous being on his own and the made sure that I was comfortable and reassured me as well as my son. \nThen he had the stitches done, this was all explained to my son in a way he could understand and they kindly put peppa pig on for him to watch ; and it was all very skilfully done , although my son didn’t enjoy having the stitches put in it was done in the most reassuring way possible. \nThen it was partly glued and steristrips put over the top. \nI was a bit worried about the scar as it’s just above his eyebrow, but I am pleased to say now the scab & steristrips have come off there is a really neat line of a scar. Very impressed with the handiwork of the doctor so well done !!! Thank you.\nApart from actually having the stitches put in my son enjoyed the hospital experience!!!!!  One happy mummy & little boy.

I had my son with me alseep in his car seat.  \r\nI was met at the reception by two members of staff. One was so unpleasant, they almost barked at me that the clinic was now only seeing emergencies and that I could not have the coil removed, and that I also would need someone to look after my son. The other staff member certainly was not as unpleasant, but did reiterate it was emergencies only. I burst in to tears in the waiting room, where there were other people in the waiting room listening to me, so much so 1 of the women in the waiting room said, I can sit with your baby. I was overcome with all of this and fortunately a member of staff came out to get a drink and seen me. They instantly ushered me through the doors into their room. They were so kind to me, sat me down, let me cry and then asked how they could help me. I was so relieved as I was now concerned I was being judged by the other staff members.  \r\nI asked them if I could have my coil removed, I explained my gp had cancelled my appointment, and all I could think of was that maybe this will be my last chance to have another baby.  \r\nThey smiled and said yes they could take my coil out, they did discuss with me though if I was sure that now was the right time to try to have another baby considering we were about to enter this awful pandemic. I really appreciated this, as I felt they were listening to me and taking into account my choices.  \r\nThey removed my coil, also checked I was up to date with my smears, and had no problem with my baby being in the room.  \r\nIt's always easy to critisize health services, however it can already be daunting going into any clinical environment without hostile staff, and I would use the word hostile. The care I recieved was extremley profesional, and the member of staff was really caring and compassionate to me, but leaving the clinic I felt embarassed as I had to go by the same 2 members of staff again at the front desk, and it would certainly put me off going back to that particular clinic.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-07-10T15:24:28.4366667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-07-15T10:37:55.563","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Ayrshire & Arran","count":12},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/775851","id":"775851"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/775851/responses","id":"775851"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/775851/healthservices","id":"775851"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/775851/tags","id":"775851"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sa9-sexual-health","id":"SA9-sexual-health","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/embarrassed","id":"embarrassed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/coil","id":"coil"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/intimidated","id":"intimidated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kindness","id":"kindness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professional","id":"professional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sexual%20health","id":"sexual health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassionate","id":"compassionate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reception%20staff","id":"reception staff"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/777226","id":"777226"}]},{"id":776480,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Disjointed and rushed","body":"Had a colonoscopy.

I was then told to wait in the waiting area and I finally got called in by the the nurse 20 minutes later than what I had scheduled. The nurse came across very intimidating and cold, almost as if she wasn’t in a good mood. I was having a medical abortion so she was explaining the process to me but It was completely rushed and unorganised. Unfortunately her presence was not friendly at all, and as you can imagine I was already nervous about the whole process so her demeanour made me feel more anxious. After she quickly explained everything in minutes, I  had an ultra-sound scan and after that she was then looking at the ultra sound photos in front of me, I could clearly see the photos and as you can imagine I did not want to see that during such a distressing time. I was out of there within 10 minutes. Overall, the entire experience was awful, I was not treated like a human being, I felt disrespected and not cared for. I would never go back to this clinic and would not recommend unless you have thick skin. I hope the Romford clinic can take this onboard and treat their future patients with more kindness, patience and respect as this can really take a toll on someone mentally. I still feel sad about the whole experience to this day.

Following this, between April and June, I had 2 biopsies of the area. Both visits to hospital were daunting experiences in the midst of the Covid pandemic.  \r\nFollowing the results of the biopsies I met my surgeon Dr. Gurunathan (Consultant Head,Neck and ENT Surgeon) and his assistant Laura in Daisy Hill. This was an extremely worrying and confusing time for my family and I but I was much more relaxed after meeting Dr. Gurunathan and his team who explained the process and procedures to me in great detail.  \r\nWithin 24 hours I received a call personally from Dr. Gurunathan to confirm that my operation would be in 7-days time. He again explained to me the procedure and allowed me the opportunity to ask any questions or raise any concerns. He put my mind at rest and also kindly contacted my wife to assure her and speak directly to her. This personal touch at such a busy time for the NHS was most welcome and this attention to detail left us confident that I was in the safest possible hands.  \r\nI was admitted to Craigavon Area Hospital to have the tumour removed from my parotid gland. While I was naturally frightened by the whole process I must say that I will be forever grateful to the many staff of Craigavon Area Hospital who cared for and looked after my every need. Due to the pandemic I was admitted to the maternity ward of the Craigavon Area Hospital where each and every member of staff were fantastic and made me very relaxed and comfortable. There were too many staff to mention or even recall their names but I do hope that this message of thanks is relayed to them all.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-07-10T20:03:29.98","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-07-15T12:56:27.92","readBy":[{"name":"Southern Health and Social Care Trust","count":8},{"name":"Public Health Agency","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/775893","id":"775893"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/775893/responses","id":"775893"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/775893/healthservices","id":"775893"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/775893/tags","id":"775893"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_32024_120","id":"ZT003_32024_120","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/attention","id":"attention"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20about","id":"Cared about"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ent","id":"ent"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/maternity","id":"maternity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/neck","id":"neck"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/operation","id":"operation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/welcome","id":"welcome"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/relaxed","id":"relaxed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thanks","id":"thanks"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/776571","id":"776571"}]},{"id":776365,"author":"MyNameIsMatt","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"All thanks to the amazing work by the Orthodontic department","body":"Ever since I was little I was always bullied for the way I looked due to having a severe under bite.  \r\nWhen I first went to the hospital I was at around the age of 14 I was told I was looking at around 6 or so years for me to get the surgery I desperately wanted as my jaw was still growing, as sad as that made me I pushed through the bullying and started treatment with the clinic.  \r\nEvery single person at Good Hope Hospitals orthodontic department was incredibly nice and treated me very well, the closer I got to the surgery the better I felt about my appearance and my mental health was improving as well.  \r\nWhen I was around 18-19 I had a particularly bad experience on the bus home from college where a group of girls were laughing at and taking pictures of me, after years of similar experiences with bullying this was the straw the broke the camels back and I went home crying it'd gotten to the point where I was scared to go outside. I never interacted with anyone person to person and my mental health was probably at its lowest point and I wanted to just not \"exist\" anymore.  \r\nAt this point it would have been another 1-2 years until the surgery was likely to occur and I was seriously depressed, after the episode on the bus I vented my frustrations to the team at the orthodontics department and they were incredibly sympathetic.  \r\nDr Panesar arranged a telephone call with a previous patient who had gone through the same ordeal as me in order to help me connect with other people in my situation. Dr Panesar at this point suggested an experimental treatment that could bring the surgery forward by a few years and then they would perform the bracework after instead of before surgery.  \r\nI immediately was ecstatic to hear that this was a potential possibility and said I wanted it if it was possible, later on the department had arranged a meeting with the surgeon who would be performing the procedure and he and Dr. P talked me through everything that the surgery entailed and if I was still willing to do it and I proceeded with the surgery, when the day finally came around I was put to sleep and woke up with an entirely new face, needless to say I cried tears of joy that day as everything that had affected me my entire life and kept me up at night was gone, after years of hating myself and my appearance.  \r\nIt took a while built I was actually able to the thing I heard about my whole life called \"Confidence\" within a year of the surgery I went from failing classes and sitting at home to getting the highest grades possible, my first Job alongside my studies and a girlfriend.  \r\nI've never been so happy in my entire life and it is all thanks to the amazing work performed by the Orthodontics department at Good Hope Hospital and the amazing surgeon Mr Williams. I owe them everything. Thank you, for everything.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-07-14T15:41:09.8733333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-07-15T13:43:00.403","readBy":[{"name":"Wye Valley NHS Trust","count":2},{"name":"University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/776365","id":"776365"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/776365/responses","id":"776365"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/776365/healthservices","id":"776365"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/776365/tags","id":"776365"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rrk15","id":"RRK15","score":5},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rrk98-orthodontics","id":"RRK98-orthodontics","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bite","id":"bite"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/depressed","id":"depressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ecstatic","id":"Ecstatic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good","id":"good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/jaw","id":"jaw"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/orthodontic","id":"orthodontic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/orthodontics","id":"orthodontics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing","id":"amazing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confidence","id":"confidence"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happy","id":"happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hope","id":"Hope"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/well%20treated","id":"well treated"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/777852","id":"777852"}]},{"id":776363,"author":"CFK94","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Crohn’s treatment","body":"The level of care I receive is excellent.

Apart from one nurse who has been lovely, its a shame the rest of that team can't be lead by their example in terms of compassion and empathy.  \r\n18 months ago I was taken to A&E with unbearable abdominal pain. I could barely walk and was prone to passing out and stumbling for the pain. I sat unconscious  \r\nin the waiting room for two hours without a care. we were called in, a quick exam in A&E and was then told to go to the acute medic ward and wait for a surgeon. I left after three days of waiting (sent home and told t come back each day). 4 days later I was in Scotland for work, 1 day later I was in a Scottish emergency surgery room having my ruptured appendix removed.  \r\nNovember last year I was there as next of kin to my partner but I won't discuss their treatment on here as its very personal.  \r\nNow, July, as we speak, my partner is currently laying in a bed in the Brokham ward, waiting for emergency surgery, having been kept off any oral food or water for 4 days now, and we sit eagerly awaiting the news that their emergency appointment will be cancelled as the surgeon has finished for the day and the on call team are being kept free for 'Actual Emergencies\" which is word for word how we have just been spoken to by the nurse on shift.  \r\nSo as we draw to a close on day 5, no food or drink until the very last moment. I direct this story directly the Board of Directors of the SAHS NHS Trust.  \r\nAnd for the record, we are not an isolated case. I have seen the patients on this ward feel forgotten, abandoned and safe to say all seem to be in a great deal of physical and mental pain.  \r\nMy partner is going to self discharge as we write this. And if anything happens to her as a result of her non existent care, I will be holding those responsible to account.","criticality":"strongly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-07-11T13:25:58.6766667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-07-15T13:50:09.097","readBy":[{"name":"Surrey and Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust","count":21}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/775938","id":"775938"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/775938/responses","id":"775938"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/775938/healthservices","id":"775938"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/775938/tags","id":"775938"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rtp04_100","id":"RTP04_100","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rtp04_180","id":"RTP04_180","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rtp04_300","id":"RTP04_300","score":1},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/abandoned","id":"abandoned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/isolated","id":"isolated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/abdominal","id":"abdominal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appendix","id":"appendix"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency","id":"emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency%20surgery","id":"emergency surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/empathy","id":"empathy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/forgotten","id":"forgotten"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gynaeocology","id":"gynaeocology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lovely","id":"lovely"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassion","id":"compassion"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/one%20staff%20member","id":"one staff member"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/spoken%20over","id":"spoken over"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/776682","id":"776682"}]},{"id":775926,"author":"Trabea","authorRoleId":4,"authorRole":"a relative","title":"Trying to get my elderly mother discharged","body":"My mother was admitted to hospital to have an operation to remove cancer. It was totally successful. She’s been confused for a couple of years and we were told that this could be due to her medication or the cancer.  \r\nAfter her operation she was declared fit and well by her doctor but the discharge liaison nurse told me that my mother had had a diagnosis of dementia two years ago. Now they won’t let her come home. My father was her full time cater until recently.  \r\nDuring lockdown due to the Covid 19, they were shielding and we would call and drop off shopping but weren’t really that involved as my dad has always done a wonderful job of caring for her and she is still doing a lot for herself. She was due to go into hospital to have the cancer removed and we were all very nervous. On the morning she refused to go. My dad called me at six in the morning but I was asleep. I woke at half six and called him back on his mobile. No answer. I called the house phone and my mother said he’d gone back to bed. I went straight to their house. He’d taken an overdose.  \r\nHe was taken to hospital and thankfully made a full recovery. He said he was just frustrated that he couldn’t get her ready for such an important occasion and that despite numerous hospital appointments, tests and scans we were no nearer finding out why she was acting so strangely. We were told she didn’t have dementia. He’s very ashamed of what he did.  \r\nThe hospital released him and I spoke with them and they said they believed that it was due to being isolated during lockdown and the frustration at no diagnosis for my mother. Now the hospital have said she was diagnosed in 2018. I have all the correspondence from the hospitals and there is no mention of a dementia diagnosis. They are keeping her in hospital and whilst I can’t fault the medical care they are giving her, her mental health is really suffering. We want her home and she is desperate to be home. She’s in a room on her own due to covid, there’s no windows and she just sits in a chair all day. I feel she would benefit by being home, I’ve said that my sister and I will support my dad with all aspects of her care but they want her to go to an assessment unit. She calls me several times a day and is distraught. She just wants to come home and we want her back. I understand that we will need outside support and we will jump through hoops to get her home. There’s nothing physically wrong with her now and she has been discharged by her doctor. However, she’s still languishing in that hospital room. She thinks she’s done something wrong and that she’s in her prison. It’s breaking our hearts. What can we do. I fear for her mental health and my father’s. What can we do?","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-07-11T05:37:09.1433333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-07-15T14:43:37.84","readBy":[{"name":"Sheffield University Medical School 2020","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/775926","id":"775926"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/775926/responses","id":"775926"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/775926/healthservices","id":"775926"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/775926/tags","id":"775926"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rwf03","id":"RWF03","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confused","id":"confused"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cancer","id":"cancer"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dementia","id":"dementia"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/desperate","id":"desperate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diagnosis","id":"diagnosis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/elderly","id":"elderly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/operation","id":"operation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/overdose","id":"overdose"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wonderful","id":"wonderful"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/776756","id":"776756"}]},{"id":775945,"author":"Zebbie","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"My journey with lock down and drinking","body":"My journey with lock down and drinking more than I wanted too during lock down  \r\nDrinking more than usual because of lock down made me realize that I needed a bit of help but felt a little nervous to reach out for help until I thought how much easier it would be than trying to cut back or stop on my own.  \r\nI would like to thank everyone one that has helped me through this journey, for all their support, kindness, encouragement and for never judging me.

My maternity care has been provided under the community midwife programme \"Best Start. I cannot fault the care I have received throughout my pregnancy from my assigned Midwife. My midwife has been a consistent source of support throughout, making me feel comfortable & at ease from the very first appointment, offered valuable advice and kept me very well informed throughout. In light on the current Covid situation, I felt fearful & concerned through the later stages of my pregnancy, my midwife kept in regular contact, reassuring me & keeping me well informed of any changes etc. The one to one midwife care I received has without a doubt made my pregnancy experience a more positive one especially in the correct situation.  \r\nHowever, when labour started it was confirmed at my routine midwife appointment that day. When things progressed I made contact with the \"on call\" midwife who was already at a delivery with another patient. After being advised to contact maternity triage directly, I did so expecting to be greeted with the same compassion & understanding as I had with the community team. That wasn't the case, I was questioned regarding what level my pain was at, to be told throughout the telephone conversation I didn't sound like I'd had any pain or even contractions. Which was not the case. I felt I wasn't being taken seriously and was belittled. Being advised that it's was my first bay, things would be slow, if I came in my partner would be sent away etc. I was shocked, at my most vulnerable I expected to be taken seriously and be treated with some compassion. It was later confirmed that I was in fact ready for hospital and in early stages of labour. I felt nervous arriving at the ward due to the uncomfortable & unpleasant manner I was greeted with when calling. However, that was not the case. My experience with the team was fantastic, the assigned midwife was lovely & took great care of me until the \"Best Start\" on call midwife took over, who just happened to be my own midwife.  \r\nOverall I've had a fantastic level of care provided, especially my midwife but I do feel the admission to hospital was upsetting and an experience that could have been avoided.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-07-11T22:07:07.48","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-07-15T14:53:06.407","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lanarkshire","count":7},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":1},{"name":"Ulster University, MBBS (Medicine) 2021","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/775978","id":"775978"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/775978/responses","id":"775978"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/775978/healthservices","id":"775978"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/775978/tags","id":"775978"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l308h_501","id":"L308H_501","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nervous","id":"nervous"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/shocked","id":"shocked"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/belittled","id":"belittled"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/concerned","id":"concerned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/continuity%20of%20care","id":"continuity of care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/delivery","id":"delivery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fearful","id":"fearful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kept%20informed","id":"kept informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/labour","id":"labour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lovely","id":"lovely"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/maternity","id":"maternity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20taken%20seriously","id":"not taken seriously"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pregnancy","id":"pregnancy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/telephone%20triage","id":"telephone triage"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/triage","id":"triage"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassion","id":"compassion"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassuring","id":"reassuring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/assigned%20midwife","id":"assigned midwife"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/776992","id":"776992"}]},{"id":775988,"author":"L1234","authorRoleId":3,"authorRole":"a parent/guardian","title":"Fantastic consultant","body":"My Daughter has been under the care of Mr kilpatrick ( hand specialist at Glasgow’s children’s hospital) since she was a baby.

Then the Dr called and told him he needed another one but they could not do it at the surgery. Understandable, but they gave him a bit of paper to organise it a the hospital but with no instructions on how to organise it! It took me an hour to find out it has to be done on line, my partner is not computer literate. I managed finally to do it for him, he is vulnerable, if this was an old lady or guy with no support, how are they meant to do it. I am also sadly registered at the practice, I am immune compromised, I have only ever had one appointment in 3 years. My hospital consultant told me the Doctors should have told me to self isolate during this period. The GPs never advised me or contacted me and I have only recently found this out! I know how difficult it is for the NHS at the moment as in my role at work I deal with hospitals across 25 countries. The service or lack of service at this GP was at best awful and at worst unacceptable. I shall be contacting the Primary Care Trust and moving from this practice as soon as possible. All anyone wants when they are not feeling well, is some support and guidance. None of this has been provided to date.

Next ordeal was a biopsy, the thought of this absolutely terrified me, previously I was not too happy just having a blood sample taken, basically I am a coward when it comes to medical matters. All the staff at the biopsy were brilliant, very patient, understanding and genuinely caring. The biopsy was no where near as bad as I feared it was going to be.  \r\nNext on the agenda, Chemotherapy! Maybe I was lucky, the only after effect I had was severe constipation, alright I did not feel brilliant for a few days after each session, but that was all. My consultant is fantastic even taking the trouble to schedule my sessions so that I would be at my best for my daughters wedding.  \r\nAll that's now history and three and a half years later, I have come to terms with the fact there is no cure for my cancer, only control, I feel better than I have for years, this I am convinced is partially down to the excellent treatment I have received in the hospital coupled with the unfailing friendiness and patience of the staff, For me the only downside of hospital appointments has been car parking! .","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-07-12T17:22:23.38","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-07-15T15:36:48.157","readBy":[{"name":"Royal Devon University Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust","count":15}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/776011","id":"776011"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/776011/responses","id":"776011"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/776011/healthservices","id":"776011"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/776011/tags","id":"776011"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rbz12-oncology","id":"rbz12-oncology","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/accommodating","id":"accommodating"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bad%20back","id":"bad back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/biopsy","id":"biopsy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/caring","id":"caring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/chemotherapy","id":"chemotherapy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/constipation","id":"constipation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/consultant","id":"consultant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/prostate%20cancer","id":"prostate cancer"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/understanding","id":"understanding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/patience","id":"patience"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/feel%20better","id":"feel better"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/777179","id":"777179"}]},{"id":776012,"author":"rickwriter","authorRoleId":1,"authorRole":"a carer","title":"home care after leaving hospital","body":"My wife fell & fractured her hip in June.

A week later I was contacted and made an appointment for my 12 week scan and was told I would be contacted for my 8-10week bloods.  \r\nApproaching week 6 I contacted the EPU as I hadn't heard about my bloods to be told to contact a week later. A week later (week 7) I was told wait longer which was frustrating.  \r\nUnfortunately I experienced symptoms of a miscarriage a few days later . Not knowing what to do I turned to the Internet and the general advice was to attended Aand E. I was turned away and told to take painkillers for my pain and keep an eye on my bleeding. I was given a number to call for an EPU appointment which was made a few days later.  \r\nOn the day of the scan I was told I had a miscarriage and told to wait for the Dr. I waited 2.5 hours to see the Dr but had clearly been missed off the system as other patients after me had been and gone. To wait by yourself alone (due to covid) was torture. I was then told by the nurse that I wouldn't be seeing the Dr (assuming this was due to being seen so late) and was given information on miscarriage.  \r\nThe day after my scan appointment to confirm my miscarriage I was called by the midwife to arrange my bloods which I had been calling weeks before to book in to which I had to heart wrenchingly say I had miscarried.  \r\nBefore and during my miscarriage I have been experiencing pain on my right side which is constant and changes in severity when changing positions /walking /taking a deep breath. I called the EPU 1 week after my miscarriage and the midwife made me an appointment to see the Dr the same day. This brought a sigh of relief as it meant I could have my pain investigated and see the Dr to which I should have seen the week before.  \r\n15 minutes later I was called by the Dr to cancel my appointment due to covid and told that they were cutting down appointments which were not necessary. I was told to contact in 3 weeks if the pain continued. I went on to explain the pain was present weeks prior to the miscarriage to which was dismissed. I felt the Dr was insensitive and made me feel 'stupid' for even contacting the clinic. I am aware of the global pandemic but feel like the level of care and empathy has been substandard throughout.  \r\nBeing in the medical field I am aware that empathy and understanding is needed, especially during emotional times of miscarriage. Due to my experience, If and when I become pregnant again I will be avoiding Harlow.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-07-13T10:44:10.2033333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-07-15T15:58:44.983","readBy":[{"name":"Princess Alexandra Hospital NHS Trust","count":1},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2020)","count":1},{"name":"The Miscarriage Association","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/776070","id":"776070"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/776070/responses","id":"776070"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/776070/healthservices","id":"776070"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/776070/tags","id":"776070"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rqwg0_502","id":"RQWG0_502","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frustrating","id":"frustrating"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/alone","id":"alone"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bleeding","id":"bleeding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cancelled%20appointments","id":"cancelled appointments"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dismissed","id":"dismissed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emotional","id":"emotional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/empathy","id":"empathy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/miscarriage","id":"miscarriage"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sensitivity","id":"sensitivity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/understanding","id":"understanding"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/788448","id":"788448"}]},{"id":776576,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Consistently Good Practice","body":"The clinic has always  been an important element of our general wellbeing.

I went to visit him having arranged this with a member of staff one morning while he was there. The member of staff I spoke to informed me that I would be able to use the family room to see my dad from 16:30-17:00.  \r\nI had not seen my dad since he had become so acutely unwell and, needless to say, was anxious to see him. The last few months have been some of the most difficult my dad, my mum and I have ever experienced; largely due to my dad becoming so unwell. I arrived at 16:30 as arranged and waited outside In the rain having pressed the buzzer for reception. No response. I then pressed the buzzer for Rowan 1, which I also got no response to. I was waiting for 8 minutes with no response which was upsetting in itself as it was eating into time with my dad.  \r\nI would like to add at this point I am a student nurse and have 6 years experience as a health care assistant so I am certainly not oblivious to short staffing, busy wards and time constraints, however being on the receiving end of being left anxiously waiting to see a loved one for so long is not a nice experience. I also understand emergency situations occur meaning staff have their time further taken up. However, I saw plenty of staff around when I actually arrived - one of which was sat down around a nursing station area where I assume the buzzers are answered. Then, a person who looked like a doctor was leaving the building and without saying a word just swiped me into the building. How fortunate is it I have no intent to harm vulnerable patients as this would have been easy access to say the least.  \r\nI then walked round to the ward as I assume I had to collect my dad and take him to the family room as I wasn’t given instructions to state otherwise. I was, again, allowed on the ward freely and could see my dad instantly as I arrived on the ward - he was looking upset and panicked. As I went to walk to get him and he was walking towards me a very abrupt and stern member of staff put their arm in front of my dad to stop him walking towards me and told me “quickly, come in”! “Shut the door quick!” And also tried to physically stop me entering as though my dad was an aggressive man trying to randomly leave the ward? When I explained that this was my dad and I was visiting him this staff member said they thought I was staff, and shouted that I had to get out! And walked towards me intimidatingly to usher me out. Again, how poorly regulated and how fortunate I wasn’t someone with intent to harm a vulnerable patient group.  \r\nBy this point my dad was saying “they’ve told me I don’t have a visitor” before the door was shut on us both. I would like to point out my dads section was lifted at this point. I understand now that visitors are not allowed on the ward having spoken to my mum who has visited several times, however this was not explained to me prior and no one would let me in the building or answer the buzzer to explain where I had to go. My dad was then escorted out to meet me where I was “greeted” by another abrupt and stern member of staff who literally shouted “TWO METRES” (as we walked on opposite sides of the corridor to one another).  \r\nWe were escorted to the family room where our time together had already been eaten into to then be greeted by a confused family member who rudely asked what we were doing there. Through an unpleasant interaction we found we had each been told that we had booked the room. The staff member heard this and said nothing.  \r\nMy dad, extremely upset, anxious and depressed having attempted suicide multiple times over the past few months in some horrific ways was mortified and already distressed by being told by staff that he never even had a visitor today - there had been a very clear cut lack of communication amongst staff. By this point I ended the visit with him and was too upset to even attempt speaking to the rude and unapproachable staff member that had escorted my dad out of the ward. I would also like to mention I was told to wear a mask upon entering the hospital and the family member who interrupted the time I had with my dad was not wearing one and had her arm around her family member in front of the staff member. I, on the other hand, had been shouted at like a child “TWO METERS” whilst walking on two separate sides of the corridor.  \r\nMy dad has described the hospital as a “prison” and told me “it depends who you get” “they are so disorganised and don’t communicate nicely” when I asked if the staff were treating him kindly. While I understand it is a secure unit for adult males who have been sectioned, this is disturbing to hear.  \r\nAs a an experienced student nurse I am beyond mortified and disgusted. Ironically, I had bought a box of chocolates and a card to give to staff as a gesture of appreciation for “caring” for him. I appreciate the hard work and determination it takes to be a nurse. How I wish I would have saved my money.  \r\nI believe the staff on Rowan 1 need training on communication and how to speak to and treat people like autonomous, adult human beings. Pure insult to injury has been added to a truly traumatic time for us as a family. To be clear, I will be taking this as far as it needs to be taken and will not stop before we are given an apology and are told what is going to be done about the issues I have raised. I, for one, will always advocate for vulnerable patients who may not be able to speak up for themselves. There is no excuse for poor care, period.  \r\nI have also witnessed staff members stood outside the ward smoking cigarettes and chatting away on their phone on their break where family members are entering and leaving. I agree with my dad in that the staff appear disorganised and unprofessional.  \r\nAfter I wrote the above, I was shockingly informed by my mum that just before my dad left Rowan 1 he had a staff member come to him in a confrontational manner saying they had “beef\" with him, accusing him of refusing his meds 3 times that morning, and in my dads words, was “in his face”. My dad was sleeping that morning due to sleeping tablets he has was given the night before having an effect and that is the reason he didn’t take his medication.  \r\nNeedless to say I was disgraced to say the least. My dad gave me the name of the member of staff who acted in this disgusting way towards him and I rang the ward wanting an explanation. A manager called me back after being in meetings all day and said, stuttering over themselves and clearly constructing a story as they went, my dad had maybe been taken the wrong way because the member of staff said “no beef\" and had told him not to worry about not taking his medication that morning. The manager confirmed they were not there when it happened and they were going off what the staff member had told them.  \r\nMy dad would NEVER lie about something like that and is an extremely anxious and none confrontational person. Having seen how the staff there talk to people and how rude and unprofessional they came across to me I find it perfectly believable.  \r\nI hope and pray that no one else’s family has to endure that kind of behaviour and go through what we have gone through and the hell my dad has had to endure at the worst time of his life.  \r\nI am contemplating taking this to the care quality commission or at least the NMC. I hope members of the public see this and speak out at the first sign of something off on that ward.  \r\nThere are other scenarios I would like to complain about however I will leave it here as these are the ones that have stuck most in my head and upset me so much.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-07-09T07:52:45.0133333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-07-15T16:18:48.043","readBy":[{"name":"Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust","count":29}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/775447","id":"775447"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/775447/responses","id":"775447"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/775447/healthservices","id":"775447"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/775447/tags","id":"775447"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rhanm-rowan1","id":"rhanm-rowan1","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/aggressive","id":"aggressive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxious","id":"anxious"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confused","id":"confused"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disgusted","id":"disgusted"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/traumatic","id":"traumatic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/approachable","id":"approachable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/distressed","id":"distressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/instructions","id":"Instructions"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professionalism","id":"professionalism"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attitude","id":"staff attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vulnerable","id":"vulnerable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appreciation","id":"appreciation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/family%20kept%20informed","id":"family kept informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/consistency%20of%20care","id":"consistency of care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/response%20to%20buzzer","id":"response to buzzer"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/conflicting%20information","id":"conflicting information"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/spoken%20over","id":"spoken over"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/776698","id":"776698"}]},{"id":776088,"author":"Beltrami","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Tooth extraction","body":"Amazing care at the Albion Dental Hospital in Glasgow today when I was getting my tooth extracted.
