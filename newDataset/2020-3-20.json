The GP that we met with was extremely good, listened to the concerns, conducted a thorough examination, and explained treatment options. Their approach was very reassuring, and presented as really interested and invested in us. I have always had a very satisfying experience within this surgery but when dealing with sensitive issues and having worries about family it was reassuring to have been met with such approachable and receptive professionals.

I understand that doctors are busy, but I have always felt that they were very brusque and dismissive, didn't give me a chance to explain my symptoms and medical history, or clearly go over the steps I should take. I always left appointments feeling upset and still confused about the best thing to do for my health. The doctors seemed to approach problems by prescribing anything they could and then getting me out the door as soon as possible. I don't feel as though I was treated as an individual and always felt that they would prefer that I wasn't there at all. Again, I'm sure the doctors are just busy and see people with bigger problems than mine, but they always made me feel like an obstacle rather than a patient.

I have been self isolating for the past week because of a health conscious diction specified in the 'vulnerable' category. I was able to keep 2m away from people from the entrance to the X Ray Dept. The receptionist was very professional and friendly. Thank her for that. I stood away from the two women waiting and was listening to the latest from the First Minister and Scottish politician. A member of staff came to turn up the volume which was fine.However they went on to make a flippant comment which I found inappropriate. We know nothing about what's happening. This did not Instil confidence. As a member of NHS staff myself I was taken aback because we are sent an email Daily Digest and Newsflash. Also there was an open session on at the hospital that day.  \r\nAll else was fine. I would have liked reassured that the plastic basket was anti bac between patients.  \r\nToday I went to Outpatient area 2 to see the surgeon. There were at least 20/30 people waiting all sitting in close proximity. The whole area was very quiet and people could have been split up. Chairs could have been removed to create distance. My partner and I waited down the short corridor at 2a area. The surgeon was very professional and clearly experienced. The student nurse was lovely. And they were all very respectful. My partner is a wheelchair user and plenty of space to accommodate that. Thank you.  \r\nThen we went off to X-ray again.  \r\nThis time there was a sign in the desk about Covid 19 and symptoms and the same lovely receptionist asked the relevant questions. There was a sign that said 'if you are self isolating....' to inform. I did that and they had NO idea what to do but did go to check, came back and asked us to sit amongst the busy waiting area!  \r\nWe were then offered a potentially infected laminated waiting number which we declined. We waited in the corridor.  \r\nThe nurse who came to fetch us was lovely. This nurse offered to push my partners wheelchair but since we saw them wipe their nose on their bare arm, we declined.  \r\nAnother blue plastic basket to navigate. Had it been cleaned since I was there the other day?  \r\nConsultant and the nurse were informative and supportive and I thank them. The bourse was painless yay!  \r\nBack to Waiting area 2 which was quieter but tried to maintain the requisite 2 metres with difficulty.  \r\nOffered a phone call with results instead of a visit. Good call!  \r\nThanks where thanks are few. But shocking in the lack of precautions. I've been offered home working and I'm glad I dont have to go back into hospital until after this crisis.  \r\nI hope you understand that I am not an anxious person. I am an NHS Staff member and am thinking maybe I shouldn't have retired so early!!","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-03-19T20:21:59.06","progress":"Made change","dateOfPublication":"2020-03-20T10:48:30.657","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Ayrshire & Arran","count":14},{"name":"NHS Education for Scotland","count":1},{"name":"Scottish Government","count":1},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/749581","id":"749581"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/749581/responses","id":"749581"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/749581/healthservices","id":"749581"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/749581/tags","id":"749581"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/a111h-xrays","id":"A111H-xrays","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/consultant","id":"consultant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/infection%20control","id":"infection control"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mammogram","id":"mammogram"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurse","id":"nurse"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/receptionist","id":"receptionist"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/some%20staff","id":"some staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/student%20nurse","id":"student nurse"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ultrasound%20scan","id":"Ultrasound scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vulnerable","id":"vulnerable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting%20area","id":"waiting area"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/x-ray","id":"X-ray"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/no%20confidence","id":"no confidence"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/753522","id":"753522"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/753611","id":"753611"}]},{"id":749265,"author":"March2020","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Emergency eye appointment","body":"I had an appointment recently at the Eye OP clinic. It was an emergency appointment and I had been told it would be busy so I had no problem with having to wait.  \r\nMy concerns are as follows:  \r\n1) I saw no staff member either wash or gel their hands during the duration of my time there (over 2 hours - most in the waiting area). This also included the staff who attended to me both nurse and doctor. In our current climate where every member of the public visiting the department was asked to gel their hands I felt this was not acceptable.  \r\n2) There were a lot of elderly patients there and they were given little assistance, no water and it was not obvious that there was any water available for anyone to drink  \r\n3) On being taken through to the doctor it was very clear that they were busy as at the start of the consultation the doctor was trying to make a phone call. They didn't have the correct number and went out then someone else came in without knocking to give the number. Another member of staff entered the room, no apology for the interruption, dropped something on the floor and then took it out of the room unwashed, uncleaned (a similar item was used to put a lens on my eye for examination). The doctor doing my assessment did not at any time wash or gel their hands and the doctor was examining my eyes. I didnt feel fully listened to at the start of the consultation - the doctor kept speaking about the wrong eye and I had to correct them. The doctor then got the details of my emergency optician appointment wrong even though I had just informed them when it had been. And then got the day of the start of symptoms wrong again even after I had just told them.  \r\nI understand when a department is busy staff can be distracted but I feel that if they need to make calls, access equipment from other rooms this should be done before a patient is taken through and/or knocking on a door when a consultation is taking place is not acceptable. They also need to pay attention to the details the patient provides them with during the consultation as this is the only time that patient will have with that member of the healthcare team.  \r\nI feel that my management and discussion around the issues I was having were treated very lightly as if it was an inconvenience for me to be there. I did not feel information about the diagnosis was given that well - it was almost as if it didn't matter. Well it does to me!  \r\nThere was one nurse who I felt was professional and caring working that afternoon","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-03-18T10:16:11.9433333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-03-20T11:22:46.58","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Grampian","count":4},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":1},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2020)","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/749265","id":"749265"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/749265/responses","id":"749265"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/749265/healthservices","id":"749265"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/749265/tags","id":"749265"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/n101h_130","id":"N101H_130","score":0},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20listened%20to","id":"not listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/eye","id":"eye"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/eye%20examination","id":"Eye examination"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hand%20washing","id":"hand washing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20hygiene","id":"staff hygiene"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/749668","id":"749668"}]},{"id":749664,"author":"A happy wife","authorRoleId":4,"authorRole":"a relative","title":"Husbands Gastric Illness","body":"My husband was recently admitted to Fvrh for an ongoing gastric condition that flares up every few years. There is no cure at present and sometimes he responds to medication, other times he does not. He was originally admitted to CAU, then up to SAU, then along to B32 (where he met a fab nurse he called Joe, who’s care and bubbly demeanour was fab). He was then moved down to a 3 bedded bay in Day Surgery where he spent 1 night before being moved yet again to a single room round the corner. 5 moves in 5 days, which wasn’t ideal.  \r\nEvery new ward he went to, he had to explain his condition all over again to the staff, which he found quite draining. He spent the next full week in his room in Day Surgery and as hospitals go, it was like having private care. The staff in Day Surgery are some of the most wonderful staff you’ll meet. The care, attention and concern they showed towards my husband and myself was second to none. They kept his spirits up with their friendly chat and stories. Nothing was too much of a bother and in fact one nurse took the time to sit down with him and discuss a plan of action with regards to his fluids and vitamin Iv’s. She was instrumental in getting him the hydration and energy therapy he had been on during a previous hospital admission and which we felt he needed at that point.  \r\nThere are too many staff members to each name individually but everyone from the fantastic nurses, auxiliaries, domestics and housekeepers (who kept him going with what dinner choices he couldn't manage to eat: ), and kept him topped up with black tea, are all just a credit to the NHS.  \r\nEven after he had a gastric feeding tube inserted by the lovely Louise, the staff kept popping in to ask if he was ok, did he want to try something to eat or drink, did he need anything? Excellent overall care.  \r\nAfter much discussion with Kay, a lovely dietitian, a plan for discharge was put in place. On the day he left, Arlene went out of her way to help him down to the main entrance with all his bags and waved us off.

The nurse was lovely and very reassuring. I came away thinking I was silly for worrying and would feel ok about going for another one in the future.  However I was called back for further testing and my second visit left me feeling shaky and numb. I see others on here have mentioned the warm welcome at reception, I found no such welcome. Soon after I arrived my name was called and I was ushered into a changing room. I asked the nurse if they could tell me why I had been called back as the letter I received was vague, and was told in a very brisk tone, it will be explained to you later. Once the mammogram was done I was called in to see the consultant. Here I was told that they wanted to do more tests, a scan and also a biopsy as they were not totally happy about something the mammogram had picked up. I explained I was nervous about the biopsy. The consultant did not have any of my previous history or test results from years before available during this consultation, even though I had discussed this with the first mammogram nurse several weeks before. Why was this information not available? The consultant did reassure me that they would request this information but did not think it would be of much help. We discussed the findings and then I had the scan. The scan was not conclusive enough and I was informed a biopsy would be needed. It all seemed to happen rather quickly, no time to think. The consultant re-assured me it would not hurt and that I would be fine with the procedure. The nurse was incredible kind and they both talked to me to help calm my nerves. It was at about this point that the whole situation became too much and I just couldn't stop the tears from flowing. The nurse was lovely and offered tissues but the consultant then said 'why are you crying now?' I have say I struggled to know how to respond. I'm lying there half dressed, feeling I must agree to this biopsy, I'm scared stiff, having just mentally peeled myself off the floor because the implication of this procedure is, I might have breast cancer and the consultant wants to know why I'm crying now! Was there a specific point at which I was supposed to cry? The final two nurses I saw were lovely especially the one who took the final mammogram. I know the staff are very busy and they have a lot of appointments to get through and for them it must be just patient after patient, but for the person who has just been told 'there is something on your scan that we are not happy with and needs further investigation' it has just become one of the worst days of their life. Being efficient is one thing but being kind makes all the difference. I left that day to walk back to the car and my teeth were chattering in my head even though I wasn't cold and I was shaking uncontrollably. When I think back on it now, I think I was in shock. I'm in no hurry to return but unfortunately I will have to.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-03-18T21:50:26","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-03-21T07:45:14","readBy":[{"name":"University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust","count":1},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2020)","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/749763","id":"749763"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/749763/responses","id":"749763"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/749763/healthservices","id":"749763"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/749763/tags","id":"749763"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rweae","id":"RWEAE","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nervous","id":"nervous"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scared","id":"scared"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/biopsy","id":"biopsy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breast","id":"breast"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breast%20cancer","id":"breast cancer"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cancer","id":"cancer"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/head","id":"head"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mammogram","id":"mammogram"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scan","id":"scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/welcome","id":"welcome"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happy","id":"happy"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/753091","id":"753091"}]},{"id":749762,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"REQUIRES UPDATING PROCEDURES","body":"I was very pleased to learn I was going to North Downs Hospital as I have been previously and treated extremely well.

I was sent away with a couple of dressings and aftercare instructions and my worries about it bursting and causing infection lifted. I only wish I could find a GP like this lady, she is a credit to her profession and the hospital.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-03-20T23:20:28","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2020-03-21T12:03:07","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/749769","id":"749769"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/749769/responses","id":"749769"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/749769/healthservices","id":"749769"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/749769/tags","id":"749769"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rcf22","id":"RCF22","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/aftercare","id":"aftercare"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/antibiotics","id":"antibiotics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/concerned","id":"concerned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dressings","id":"dressings"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/infection","id":"infection"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/leg","id":"leg"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lump","id":"lump"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/normal","id":"normal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20concerned","id":"very concerned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20ease","id":"at ease"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"}]},{"id":749768,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Fantastic, thank you!!

Could not recommend them enough and the consultant/ surgeon who carried out the procedure. 1 year on and I am more mobile and able to do things that were previously limited to me.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-03-18T19:36:37.2833333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-03-22T15:20:01.997","readBy":[],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/749378","id":"749378"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/749378/responses","id":"749378"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/749378/healthservices","id":"749378"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/749378/tags","id":"749378"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/nvc04","id":"NVC04","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/all%20staff","id":"all staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/caring","id":"caring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/content","id":"content"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helpful","id":"helpful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kept%20informed","id":"kept informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/knee","id":"knee"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/knee%20replacement","id":"knee replacement"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/operation","id":"operation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain%20relief","id":"pain relief"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/patient-centred","id":"patient-centred"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/quality%20of%20care","id":"Quality of care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/rehabilitation","id":"rehabilitation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgeon","id":"surgeon"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/visiting%20time","id":"visiting time"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20for","id":"cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happy","id":"happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported","id":"supported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/752871","id":"752871"}]},{"id":749810,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Outstanding!","body":"I visited the Breast Unit today.

I was given a phone call consultation a week or so prior and they managed to fit me in but the dates were extremely limited and I am so grateful for them for managing to find an appointment for me. We booked a hotel as we live 2 hours from the clinic and I went on the first day. The wait times were long which didn’t help with anxiety but it’s understandable considering how busy the staff are. I was had the first part of the procedure done which was really hard for me and I could not thank the staff enough for being there for me and helping me through it. Not once did I feel judged, I was given so many options, and even when having the first part done they made me feel so comforted and listened to as I was extremely scared. The second morning I came back and had to wait but again I had no complaints about this it’s just to make people aware to be prepared for that. The second part was done under general anaesthetic so I do not remember but when I woke up I was in a lot of discomfort and the nurses were so caring they ensured I would not leave until I was as comfortable as can be. I just want to thank all of the staff that week at BPAS Richmond. That was one of the hardest things I’ve ever had to do and not something I ever thought I would have to decide at 21 but your compassion and care is what got me through it and I will forever be grateful for that.

A long complaint letter about the poor treatment I had received on my stays in St Peters. I swore not to ever step foot in the place again, it was so horrendous, mainly about the attitude and lack of caring \nof staff.  \nHowever, I feel very strongly I must write again. On Friday 14th Feb. I had to attend your  A & E department. I wasn’t looking forward to it but from the moment I walked into the A & E department I felt the difference. I anticipated abruptness and feeling a nuisance and what did I get? I haven’t stopped telling people since.\nThe whole process was so organised. Every person I came into contact with, whether it be doctors (2) medical staff or not, made me feel I mattered.  I came into contact with about 12 people in different roles. They were all caring and concerned for my comfort at every stage. Regardless of the fact that my process took 8 hours, the length of time due only to the wait between each different department I went to, I didn’t mind waiting. I felt at no time that I had been forgotten.  I had a thorough investigation to find out what was giving me so much pain and they finally got there leaving me very relieved and arrangements were made via my doctor for me to receive the necessary treatment I need. \nTwo people went out of their way to help me, (even though it wasn’t their job!). One young lady from the pharmacy and the other one of the reception staff. \nWhat can I say? This should be a prime model of how to run an \nA & E department.

I was very disappointed and thought that the doctor would give me the tablets that I needed to help me quit so my journey to quit would start from leaving the surgery so I thought, the doctor told me that it would take at least another 2 weeks for the smoking clinic to contact me with an appointment and get the tablets, my decision to quit now started to disappear.  \r\nWhat's the point when you ask for help and get made to wait even longer, 2 weeks later I had a letter from the quit smoking clinic to call them and make an appointment I did this and attended only to be told by the health professional that they were really sorry that I had to wait and the doctors surgery should have given me the clinic number to call instead of waiting for the doctor, I had my health check with the clinic staff member and now I was informed that I had to take a letter back to my doctors to collect my prescription for the tablets 🙄  \r\nSo I handed them into reception as the pharmacy bit was not open this was on a Wednesday around 1pm the receptionist reassured me the tablets would be ready to collect by Friday afternoon, I was away for that weekend and said would it be ok to collect it on the Monday afternoon, I was told yes they will definitely be ready by then, so I thought great at last I can start my journey to quitting, how wrong was I.  \r\nThis is not the first time that wrong information has been given. I went to collect my tablets to be told that they didn't have them the letter I gave them on the Wednesday had been scanned into the computer but a doctor had not seen it yet and has to see it before they can do the prescription then they needed 2 days to order it in, I will not be using your dispensary it due to my experiences. I have for a long time now only ever collected the paper prescription and took it to my own chemist who can give me my medication on the same day.  \r\nI feel the staff at this surgery have given out the wrong information in the past and when that happens its very unprofessional.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-03-02T17:05:58.43","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-03-23T08:47:56.603","readBy":[],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/746218","id":"746218"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/746218/responses","id":"746218"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/746218/healthservices","id":"746218"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/746218/tags","id":"746218"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/f81137","id":"F81137","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frustrated","id":"frustrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dispensing","id":"dispensing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/information","id":"information"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/smoking","id":"smoking"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unhelpful","id":"unhelpful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wait%20time","id":"wait time"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20disappointed","id":"very disappointed"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/845891","id":"845891"}]},{"id":749829,"author":"Alfysmum","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Having my baby","body":"I had my baby last week following the ward change over to ward 15.  \r\nI was nervous about the change but the staff were fantastic, they took it all in there stride and remained positive during such uncertain times.

Having never even had a general anaesthetic I was extremely nervous. The process was seamless and I was kept aware of every step I had to take. Within an hour I had seen the Surgeon and the anaesthetist and was prepped for surgery. They immediately sensed my nervousness and put me at ease. I didn’t cope well with the anaesthetic and was very sick for a few hours. The care and attention I received in the following few hours  whilst in recovery was outstanding and for which I am very grateful. If I have one criticism it was the lack of information on post op after care. I wasn’t really informed about changing dressings or when to see my Doctor etc. I would have absolutely no hesitation in recommending this hospital. I received 5 star treatment.

Because the blood sample was diluted with the liquid in the tube, the results showed that she needed a blood transfusion. A doctor came in to see her first thing this morning asking if she had any idea why her blood count had dropped so much. My daughter explained that the nurse had used the feeding tube to take the blood. She told her not to use that tube because she knows it shouldn't be used for that purpose and  it can only be touched under extreme sterile conditions but the nurse over ruled her and said it would be fine.
