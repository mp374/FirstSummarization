I was put into a room on my own as they suspected covid. A member of staff was monitoring my baby and left me on the machine for 3 hours, I kept telling them I needed the toilet they said no I have 2 stay on the monitor and to think about my baby. I was in so much pain I kept telling them and they did not listen.  \r\nAfter 3hours a doctor checked my cervix and my waters had broke and I was at 4cm and my baby was distressed. They monitored my baby for 12 hours. The next day after a painful night and 3 failed epidurals they decided I needed a emergency csection.  \r\nAfter the birth I wasnt allowed to see my baby, my partner asked a staff member if he could go home and get a shower and come back they said yes it was ok. Once he went they came in and told me he couldnt come back now hes gone. I met my son the next day and he was on antiboitics through a drip later in the day he needed it topping up and the childrens ward did not want him on the ward as I was suspected covid and they wouldnt come into my room either it was very stressful. One of the staff spoke to them and they sent someone over to do it outside my room.  \r\nMy test came back covid negative and I had a infection somewhere they did xrays, ultrasounds but they did not do a vaginal swab. I blame it on not letting me get up to go to the toilet. My son was jaundice it was a scary situation for me being a first time mum all alone. He had treatment in the incubator and was screamimg and not breathing right he was scared so they brought a mat light down for him to lay on. Later in the night a member of staff came in and said another baby needs that light he will have to go im the incubator I said my son needs this he stopped breathing in the incubator they said if you dont let me take it childrens ward will take it. I begged and begged, in the end they found one somewhere else.  \r\nI did want more children but after this happening I cannot go through that ever again some of the staff members were very rude on the recovery ward I would never recommend anyone to have their baby here after my experience.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-06-27T07:52:15.6566667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-07-01T10:59:56.347","readBy":[{"name":"Doncaster and Bassetlaw Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/774170","id":"774170"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/774170/responses","id":"774170"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/774170/healthservices","id":"774170"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/774170/tags","id":"774170"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rp5dr_501","id":"RP5DR_501","score":1},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scared","id":"scared"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/alone","id":"alone"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/birth","id":"birth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cervix","id":"cervix"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/distressed","id":"distressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency","id":"emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/infection","id":"infection"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/jaundice","id":"jaundice"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/774544","id":"774544"}]},{"id":774221,"author":"DaisyChain75","authorRoleId":3,"authorRole":"a parent/guardian","title":"Diagnosis pathway","body":"I moved to Crewe in May 2019. My son was 6 years old at the time (he's now 7, nearly 8) my family and I came from Telford, where he was on a waiting list for a diagnosis process for ADHD which wasn't going to proceed for a long long time due to staffing issues. Once we moved to Crewe, I had a referral in place for him immediately. I waited a couple of months and finally got his initial appointment expedited due to the nature and severity of his symptoms. He was seen in August 2019 after his appointment was expedited. His current school and myself, then waited a month before we got the infamous 'Connor's questionnaire', which were promptly filled in by both of us. Time ticked on and I hadn't heard anything going into January. I phoned the paediatric team, who told me they acknowledged the forms in December and that the next step on my son's diagnosis pathway would be about 6 months from then taking it to about June time.  \r\nSometime in February before Coronavirus lockdown came about, I asked the team to please expedite his appointment again (after all, there was obviously a reason for his first one to be so urgent). I was told I'd need a GP to write to them to confirm reasons. First GP I asked refused to get involved. I then asked another who sent correspondence regarding my concerns. I heard nothing, so contacted the team again who told me they couldn't even see any correspondence and that if they thought his appointment should be expedited again from what the doctor wrote, then they would have done. I waited yet again, then lockdown occurred. I contacted them again only to be told they were now only dealing with already medicated patients!! I asked another GP to write to them and I STILL haven't heard anything!!!!!! He should have been seen by now and I know that Coronavirus/Covid-19 has turned the whole world upside down, but to hear nothing at all is EXTREMELY irritating. In the meantime, I have found out, they only want to go down the ASD diagnosis route and not ADHD too which is absurd! Nobody in Telford would even acknowledge he had ASD traits and only wanted to diagnose ADHD. I'm mum and I know he struggles with both disorders.  \r\nThe outcome for him, was to medicate to hopefully help control his impulsivity etc. which is of major concern.  \r\nThere seems to be nowhere I can turn to to be able to help him. PALS haven't even replied to me.  \r\nTo get no response at all from anywhere or anyone is very worrying and my family and I feel really let down.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-06-28T17:17:28.7","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-07-01T11:13:42.063","readBy":[{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2021)","count":1},{"name":"Mid Cheshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/774221","id":"774221"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/774221/responses","id":"774221"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/774221/healthservices","id":"774221"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/774221/tags","id":"774221"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rbt20_420","id":"RBT20_420","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/concern","id":"concern"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/adhd","id":"adhd"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/asd","id":"ASD"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication%20between%20services","id":"communication between services"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diagnose","id":"diagnose"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diagnosis","id":"diagnosis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/paediatric","id":"paediatric"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pals","id":"pals"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pals.","id":"PALS."},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/urgent%20referral","id":"urgent referral"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wait%20for%20appointment","id":"wait for appointment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/coronavirus","id":"coronavirus"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/777288","id":"777288"}]},{"id":774503,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Great Service","body":"The care I received from the Urology team was great.

The Castle Practice is by far the best! The first thing to say is that when you need a doctor the reception staff will try to get an appointment for you, they may ask a few questions but this is only so they can place you with the right doctor and not just anyone! When you see a doctor they will give you time and supply you with the correct advice/treatment, or directed you through the necessary steps to complete the treatment. The support staff are always ready to listen and help people and do so in a caring manner! It's very easy to make a complaint, and sometimes the answer is not the one a patient wants, but at the Castle Practice they will leave no stone unturned to try to solve an issue. They show compassion and really care about their patients! During this unique time of Covid 19, Corona Virus, the Castle Practice has given over the surgery as a Covid Unit and all of the staff included the medical team have been running from three different sites. The doctors have used all the technologies at their disposal from their own homes.

They suggested we call the out-patient co-ordination but no one answered after trying numerous times.  \r\nI spent the day with my daughter in June and was alarmed at her mental state and also her condition, she was constantly shaking, her heart was racing and her skin was oozing. My husband and I decided to take her to A and E where she stayed for 3 days.

Although it took almost an hour for an ambulance to arrive once it did the team acted swiftly and compassionately towards my Dad who was desperately ill by this time.  \r\nObviously with Covid restrictions I was unable to accompany him to the hospital which was very distressing not only for myself but also for my father.  \r\nOnce at Ninewells the consultant Alistair who cared for my father kept me fully updated as to his condition and also had to make the very difficult phone call to me to tell me that sadly my father had passed away.  \r\nAlistair explained that I would be allowed in to see my Dad but unfortunately I myself had tested positive for Covid 19 and was unable to see my father in hospital so my last memory of my Dad was him leaving to go to Ninewells  \r\nI cannot praise the staff enough who looked after my father at what must have been an extremely difficult and frightening time for them all and to have to advise families of a death under these restrictive circumstances must be very upsetting. Even after my fathers death Alistair contacted me again later in the day to ensure that I was okay and I also got the opportunity to speak to Paula the nurse who held my Dads hand as he died. Her words and those of Alistair have been a huge source of comfort to me to know that my Dad was not alone and someone was with him has helped me hugely.  \r\nI have worked for NHS Tayside for over 20 years and am incredibly proud to work for an organisation that has shown determination and true courage in facing and managing this pandemic.  \r\nI will forever be indebted to these incredible individuals for making a heartbreaking situation a little bit easier.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-06-29T10:05:54.0733333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-07-01T13:32:50","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Tayside","count":20},{"name":"Scottish Ambulance Service","count":17},{"name":"Scottish Government","count":1},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/774268","id":"774268"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/774268/responses","id":"774268"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/774268/healthservices","id":"774268"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/774268/tags","id":"774268"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/scot-ambulance-emergency","id":"scot-ambulance-emergency","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/t101h_180","id":"T101H_180","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20about","id":"Cared about"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/caring%20staff","id":"caring staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/consultant","id":"consultant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/indebted","id":"indebted"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurse","id":"nurse"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/paramedic%20care","id":"paramedic care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/passed%20away","id":"passed away"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassionate","id":"compassionate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wait%20for%20ambulance","id":"wait for ambulance"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid-19","id":"covid-19"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/774541","id":"774541"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/774639","id":"774639"}]},{"id":774243,"author":"larjag","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Melenoma care in lockdown","body":"I was diagnosed with stage 3 mestasis melenoma at the end of February and despite the pending lockdown this worked in my favour in terms of the speed of care offered. I was already reviewed by the melenoma clinic  \r\nAnd had first hand experience of the excellent, person centred and dedicated care offered by Advance melenoma Nurse Ashleigh who has been a god send for the last few years but in particular 2020 no words or amount of thanks could describe how grateful I am for the support she has given me emotionally and also her response to my physical care and treatment has been consistently attentive, informative and proactive. Ashleigh is very active in engaging me in my care plan and respond promptly to any phone and email communication. If there was a nomination for a nursing award she would 100% get my vote as she is everything I would hope from a nursing practitioner and more.  \r\nMy consultant Mr Rahman worked closely with Ashleigh and I seen scans, tests and surgery all actioned within two weeks of confirming recurrence.  \r\nI had my surgery in March and thereafter was cared for in plastics and burns. The staff from cleaning staff, health care assistances and amazing nurses, doctors and consultants have almost become my second family during lockdown having spent 12 days post surgery as an i patient followed by a Series of outpatient Appointments at dressings clinics. Then due to a infection A further week in April and three weeks in June back on ward 214.  \r\nThe only thing I can say about all staff of 214 is that they are AMAZING, they clearly work well as a team and the ethos they have created in Their ward is felt and is incomparable to any previous hospital care I have received.  \r\nAll nursing staff are very person centred and as well as offering highly competent and attentive physical care they take time to chat and ensure emotional well-being If patients. Their is a nice feel to the whole ward and even when busier this care has not faltered. Nothing ever feels to much to ask of them and they actively encourage you to buzz them whenever help is needed. The nurses are friendly, approachable and warm In their practice and are very informative and Strong advocates in ensuring I was well informed in my care plan.  \r\nAll my stays have been during lockdown and I am aware this has brought all kinds of hurdles to be navigated however this isn’t obvious to patients, they offer inclusive care and were able to offer regular support and updates to my Family when I felt to unwell to do so and this was over and above their role but so very appreciated and instrumental in my recovery.  \r\nBeing a patient isn’t something one hopes or plans for especially for 6 weeks however I have felt so well cared for and my Ongoing recovery Has only been achievable thanks to the melenoma and plastics team. I have got to know the staff during this period and joke that they are now my lockdown family having seen them more than anyone outwith my household.  \r\nWhilst I am looking forward to getting home and returning to care as an outpatient this review is only a small bit of my gratitude and I hope that anyone who is due similar surgery or care in ward 214 feels reassured that they will be in safe and caring hands of a highly person centred, skilled and caring multidisciplinary team.  \r\nThank you all so very much.  \r\n","criticality":"not

I have to admit I was really scared going into any hospital but as I had suffered a heart attack I had absolutely no choice.  \r\nOn the whole i noticed a bit of a step-up in relation to infection Prevention & Control practices in general but, in the short time I was an in-patient I witnessed several different events where the practices of medical staff would definitely have spread Covid-19 if it had been present in the wards.......and who knows really whether it was or not?  \r\nThe concerns relevant to Wishaw General are as follows:  \r\nNo new patients were screened for Covid-19 on admission. I know this because I wasn’t and when I asked others they confirmed that they weren’t either. On admission to the A&E department I expressed my fear and I was told “Don’t worry, you’ll be fine, there’s no Covid in here” How do they know that if they weren’t checking new people coming in? To make sure I was as safe as possible I requested that I go into a side room.  \r\nThere were clear notices up on walls in side rooms in A&E telling staff to remove PPE before leaving the room.......not once was this rule followed! And I’m not just talking about nurses, senior medical practitioners were just as bad! I find this very concerning. As a senior manager of a reputable Care at Home provider I teach Infection Prevention and Control procedures to Social Care staff and failure to follow Health Protection Scotland (HPS) guidelines on appropriate use, donning of and disposal of used PPE is considered a very serious risk to patient/client health and safety.........and then I find myself blatantly exposed to this same risk!  \r\nWhen in the Emergency Care Ward where visitors are not supposed to be allowed in I witnessed a relative of one patient being allowed in to set up their relative’s phone charger (I believe it was Grandparent/Grandchild) And not only this, but after the visitor was let in they discovered they had brought the wrong phone charger so went away and came back again with the correct one about 30 mins later! This in my opinion was irresponsible and totally unacceptable. I had been rushed into hospital by ambulance so had no opportunity to bring in any essentials I would need. My daughter drove 20 miles from her home to mine and then another 10 miles to Wishaw General to get me basic essentials and she had to hand these to a nurse at the main entrance ........ which is perfectly acceptable in the current climate; why I ask is a visitor allowed right into the ward with a phone charger? I actually overheard the patient asking their visitor how they managed to get in and they said they waved their work ID badge and no-one asked anything. I just hope that same visitor was not in contact with anyone Covid-19 positive as consideration for other patients in the ward was not evident........but then, where were the medical staff’s priorities either?  \r\nIt’s all very well the DHSC putting out guidelines which are supposedly there to keep us all safe, but who is monitoring/policing any adherence (or otherwise) to these guidelines in any case? .... from what I have seen it looks like no-one is! It seems that as a patient I was the mercy of the standards and integrity of the person/s looking after me in the ward ..... scary!  \r\nAs someone who takes Duty of Care very seriously I expect you not only to investigate my concerns but let me know what steps you will be putting in place to monitor practice! this is the very reason people like me, the general public, do not want to be anywhere near hospitals during the pandemic","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-06-17T15:56:19.3366667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-07-01T15:05:49.957","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lanarkshire","count":5},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/772765","id":"772765"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/772765/responses","id":"772765"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/772765/healthservices","id":"772765"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/772765/tags","id":"772765"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l308h_180","id":"L308H_180","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l308h_320","id":"L308H_320","score":3},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fear","id":"fear"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scared","id":"scared"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/heart%20attack","id":"heart attack"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/infection%20control","id":"infection control"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medical%20care","id":"medical care"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/775462","id":"775462"}]},{"id":774381,"author":"Heart racing","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"The whole process was so efficient","body":"I am a local GP & had two episodes of a very fast heartbeat.

I saw them once and never again. The Psychosis Team were having staffing problems!  \r\nIn August 2019 I was allocated another care coordinator. I saw this one only twice. Once with their agenda to discharge my case back to the GP, presumably based on my health records as I had no opportunity to get to know them. I explained that if I was not monitored regarding my medication, then I would obey the voices and stop taking the Olanzapine. I felt that care coordinators would know if I was not taking my medication and section me if I did not. This had been a deterrent in not obeying the voices. My care told them that he would be left picking up the pieces. We got no feedback on this. The feedback that I got was the care coordinator was to discuss with their manager about discharging the case.  \r\nOn the next visit in August I was informed by the care coordinator that my case was to be discharged back to the GP. I just gave up! They said they would send me a discharge letter (I never received it until this week, following making a complaint about it). I have not had any annual GP checks stated in it.  \r\nWithin the last few weeks I have made an official complaint via PALS about the above.  \r\nNeedless to say, it does not take a genius to work out what happened next, I had no perceived deterrent and obeyed the voices, I immediately stopped taking the Olanzapine (it‘s been a year now). I was very firm with my carer and said he needed to keep it to himself or we would fall out big time.  \r\nI went through some terrible withdrawal symptoms for two weeks or so, but persevered: increased amounts of hallucinations, stomach cramps, sweats, head aches, irritability and not sleeping at night (I recently discovered that this could have been life threatening).  \r\nAfter this I found when I am not having the regular hallucinations I am having periods, when I am functioning intelligibly very well again. I would be extremely resistant to taking anti psychotic medication again and I have overcome any fear of a deterrent anyway.  \r\nYes, my carer has struggled to help me cope when I have experienced some disturbing hallucinations and when I have heard voices telling me to self harm. I feel he needs more ongoing support with this and is one of my reason for writing to you know.  \r\nDuring recent weeks I have had a recurring visual, very disturbing hallucination. I am still persevering with this without medication.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-06-24T11:22:05.0466667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-07-01T15:11:25.11","readBy":[{"name":"Plymouth University, MClinRes 2022","count":1},{"name":"Tees, Esk and Wear Valleys NHS Foundation Trust","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/773654","id":"773654"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/773654/responses","id":"773654"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/773654/healthservices","id":"773654"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/773654/tags","id":"773654"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rx3mm","id":"RX3MM","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/access%20to%20mental%20health%20services","id":"access to mental health services"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anti%20psychotic","id":"anti psychotic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/continuity%20of%20care","id":"continuity of care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/discharge%20process","id":"Discharge process"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ongoing%20support","id":"Ongoing support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/psychotic","id":"psychotic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/self%20harm","id":"self harm"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/terrible","id":"terrible"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support%20for%20carers","id":"support for carers"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/774730","id":"774730"}]},{"id":774389,"author":"gratefulme","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"You guys are awesome","body":"Huge thank you to Mr Lamb and to Avril the nurse for your kindness and compassion today.

Aimee looked after me here and from the moment I met her I felt instantly relaxed in her care. She was warm and friendly and exactly what I needed in those moments, as a first time mum at a hospital alone without my husband during this pandemic! I knew Aimee would take good care of me and ensure I was looked after.  \r\nThe hours went on and I progressed enough To be admitted to labour ward where my husband could join us. Luckily for me, Aimee got to stay with us on Labour ward instead of going back to antenatal - this made my day, week, month year!!! My husband and I were over the moon, he could tell how much I trusted Aimee and he also knew I was safe in her care.  \r\nAs we went through the night, I was progressing well and using the birth pool and gas and air. Aimee was there with us holding my hand whilst my husband was busy holding the fan and water bottle! My blood pressure increased meaning I needed medication and unfortunately had to leave the pool. This was all explained to me carefully and I understood everything, again Aimee was there with us constantly talking to me and telling me how well I was doing.  \r\nAimee had to finish her shift around 8am and unexpectedly my labour ended in a c-section at 12:29, when our baby son was born.  \r\nI missed having Aimee there, despite having two other great midwives take care of me, I felt a special connection with Aimee. Luckily she was on the postnatal ward that evening so I saw her again, and again, she was just fantastic. I truly believe she was made to do her job.  \r\nShe is a kind and caring person and any woman who meets her and who she helps during labour is extremely lucky. She will always be very special to my husband, son and I.  \r\nAimee is wonderful at what she does and truly made my experience of labour enjoyable, calm and assuring.  \r\nI had a not so great experience with another member of staff on Postnatal ward the day before I was discharge. I have since been advised that this member of staff is temporarily here to help during Covid-19. Whilst this experience was upsetting for me, it just reaffirmed what amazing care I had received from Aimee and other midwives (Lizzie and Anna included who were  \r\nalso lovely!) during my stay in hospital.","criticality":"minimally critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-06-29T16:08:51.7966667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-07-01T15:30:03.85","readBy":[{"name":"York and Scarborough Teaching Hospital NHS Foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/774326","id":"774326"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/774326/responses","id":"774326"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/774326/healthservices","id":"774326"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/774326/tags","id":"774326"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rcb55_501","id":"RCB55_501","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/antenatal","id":"antenatal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20pressure","id":"blood pressure"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/continuity%20of%20care","id":"continuity of care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/contractions","id":"contractions"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/experience","id":"experience"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fortunate","id":"fortunate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good","id":"good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kindness","id":"kindness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/labour","id":"labour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lucky","id":"lucky"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/midwives","id":"midwives"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain%20relief","id":"pain relief"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/safe","id":"safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing","id":"amazing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/calm","id":"calm"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassion","id":"compassion"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/relaxed","id":"relaxed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wonderful","id":"wonderful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/explanations","id":"explanations"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/one%20staff%20member","id":"one staff member"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/774622","id":"774622"}]},{"id":774387,"author":"Serpico","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Giving me my life back","body":"Went through my Cardiac Artery Bypass Graft 4 years ago at another hospital, never really felt right when I came out but for 1st year I put everything down to recovery process, still felt unwell for the next 3 years and had issues with GP getting referred back to cardiology.

I was dilating steadily but contractions slowed down when I got into the birthing pool. They suggested breaking my waters to speed things up so I agreed. By 5 or 6am I was fully dilated but nothing was happening and the midwife was clearly perplexed, tired and wanted me to have it before she finished her shift at 8am. She kept saying \"but the head is SO low!\". She suggested an intermittent catheter - that my bladder must be full and that was stopping me wanting to push. She fiddled around trying to insert this catheter FOUR times. In the end she had to get a colleague to do it. I am told by my friend who is a nurse, that three attempts at anything is the golden rule. Anyway - it was unpleasant and I wasn't very happy about it but by this point I could hardly speak I was so tired and sore. By 8am a more senior midwife swapped with her and must have realised I needed help as she kept going to the door to speak to someone and eventually transferred me to the delivery ward.  \r\nOnce on the delivery ward the obstetrician took one look and in about 30 seconds said \"this baby is facing sideways, he won't be coming out without some help\". I couldn't believe that no one had realised this, I'd been up for nearly 30 hours and none of the midwives had apparently noticed he was wedged sideways. They suggested an episiotomy and forceps and very rapidly got me into theatre. The obstetrician, head midwife/nurse and the anaesthetist were delightful - professional, funny, sincere and made me feel like I was finally in safe hands. They also didn't muck about and got on with it, which was a huge relief. My baby was 9.8lbs - every midwife I had seen for the last 9 months had said \"oh no, it's not a big baby, I can tell by looking at your bump\"....  \r\nI can't fault this team and was relieved to finally be in their hands. I do not understand why I wasn't moved earlier? Why didn't any of the midwives know the baby's head was sideways? Why was I left for as long as I was. My baby was delivered at 11am.  \r\nI had lost too much blood to be sent home so had to go to the horror that it the Treliske postnatal ward. I thought it was their job to check on me and my baby, not for me to call them when I needed help. They said the baby needed a feed every three hours. I was exhausted but set my alarm to feed him but he wasn't hungry. I told them this in the morning and was chastised for not waking him up / changing his nappy and making him feed. I had never had a baby before! No one told me this is what I needed to do and I had hoped that the nurses / midwives would take it upon themselves to check on me and my baby through the night. Instead, I was left on my own and then told off in the morning because I didn't know what I was doing.  \r\nOne midwife (some of them were lovely) showed me how to feed lying down, then another midwife came in a few hours later and told me off for having the baby in the bed with me. Confused and conflicting advice from the same team. Once the catheter was removed, I was told to pee in a pot and bring it back for them to look at. I did this and proudly brought my pot of pee back and flagged the attention of a maternity support worker to tell her. She said it was nothign to do with her. I said - well, your colleagues told me to do this so here it is\". She looked flustered and walked away, pee in hand. Later on I realised she hadn't recorded it because I was asked before I was discharged whether I had managed to pee after the catheter was removed. I had a thermometer shoved in my ear with no warning plenty of times, and every time told my temp was low. When I asked what that meant they said \"it could mean an infection but these machines aren't very reliable\". When I had heard this line about 6/7 times, I asked them to go and get a machine that worked and for heaven's sake tell me what my temperature was. It was like something out of a sketch show.  \r\nThe poor girl opposite me had just had a c section after being in labour for 3 days and when she asked them to help change the baby because she'd been sick, they told her to do it herself! It was appalling. All these poor women in floods of tears, without their partners, feeling like they were an imposition and not being looked after. Not only had we all had a terrible delivery, we'd been awake for HOURS.  \r\nA junior gynaecologist came to see me to feel my uterus and ask me a few questions about bowel movements. When I asked him questions about infection risk, where exactly the incision was etc. he said, honestly, that he was so junior he actually didn't know the answer to a lot of my questions. He was frightfully nice but just clueless and again, I felt neglected and like I wasn't getting professional, experienced care.  \r\nI had to hassle and hustle to be discharged. They said in the morning they were going to discharge me once my iron levels had come back but they had 'paperwork' to do. I wasn't discharged until 8pm and this was after constant constant badgering of staff to ask how long the paperwork might take and if they had spoken to the relevant consultant etc. When I was finally discharged, I was walking up the corridor and realised there was still a canula in my arm and had to ask them to take it out.  \r\nI do understand it must be a staffing issue. There were some lovely midwives on my ward, who had an excellent bedside manner (\"do you might if I stick this in your ear to take your temperature\" instead of shoving it in with no warning). But, I got the general sense that under-resourcing has led to a level of apathy in the staff and that perhaps there is a systemic problem with the culture there. Bedside manner costs nothing. Hiring maternity support workers (surely there are plenty of people in Cornwall who are in desperate need of a job and not qualified midwives) who can change sheets, pass babies, check in on the women, take blood pressure - surely?! Instead, from some of the staff, I witnessed sloppy, slapdash, cavalier and simply unemphatic behaviour.  \r\nI was relieved to be home but then proceeded to bleed large lumpy blood clots from my urethra - apparently from the trauma of the catheterisation. I adore my baby and yes, the stitches hurt and I was tired etc. but the thing I was in tears about every evening for a week was the intermittent catheterisation that caused this bleeding. I felt I had been prodded and poked by someone who clearly wasn't competent enough to get it right in three goes.  \r\nI knew Treliske postnatal ward had a bad rep - it's all over the internet but I thought since it had been in special measures, that it would be OK if I ended up there. It must be a management and culture problem.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-06-30T09:31:01.96","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-07-01T16:18:18.39","readBy":[{"name":"Royal Cornwall Hospitals NHS Trust","count":15},{"name":"Kernow Maternity Voices","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/774374","id":"774374"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/774374/responses","id":"774374"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/774374/healthservices","id":"774374"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/774374/tags","id":"774374"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/ref12_501","id":"REF12_501","score":2},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appalling","id":"appalling"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confused","id":"confused"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/neglected","id":"neglected"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bladder","id":"bladder"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bladder%20catheter","id":"Bladder catheter"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bleed","id":"bleed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breastfeeding%20support","id":"Breastfeeding Support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/delightful","id":"delightful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/desperate","id":"desperate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/episiotomy","id":"episiotomy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/exhausted","id":"exhausted"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/feeling","id":"feeling"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/humour","id":"humour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/in%20safe%20hands","id":"in safe hands"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/labour","id":"labour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/maternity","id":"maternity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/midwives","id":"midwives"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/obstetrician","id":"obstetrician"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/perplexed","id":"Perplexed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/postnatal","id":"postnatal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professionalism","id":"professionalism"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/safe","id":"safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/some%20staff","id":"some staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stitches","id":"stitches"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/team","id":"team"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/temperature","id":"temperature"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/terrible","id":"terrible"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/urethra","id":"urethra"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/uterus","id":"uterus"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happy","id":"happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/relieved","id":"relieved"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sincere","id":"sincere"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/conflicting%20advice","id":"conflicting advice"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/catheter%20insertion","id":"catheter insertion"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/774654","id":"774654"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/774717","id":"774717"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/774726","id":"774726"}]},{"id":774402,"author":"Happy New Parents","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"A perfect birthing experience for Mum, Dad and baby","body":"In June 2020 we gave birth to our first child.

I must say firstly that I appreciate and understand the difficulties of Covid-19 as I  have also been working during the pandemic.  I finally plucked up courage and spoke to a receptionist, asking if I could see a doctor.  I was told that I would get a telephone appointment, which was fine, but this could be anytime between 8.30am - 5.00pm.  I explained to the receptionist that I was still working and could the doctor possibly ring me, before I left for work.  I was told this was not possible and could I be reached by another number.  I explained that I wasn't able leave where I worked during work hours and that I didn't want to discuss my personal details, in front of colleagues.  The receptionist said she would put me down anyway, which I thought was a waste of time for the doctor and myself not being there after 10.00am, so I declined the appointment.  As mentioned not everybody has been furloughed and of course the surgery is not open, on a Saturday.  I am hoping that the problem I have is not going to get worse and become life threatening, but who knows, at my age?  Again, I appreciate the difficult situation we are all experiencing at the moment, but surely there must be some leeway, regarding individual patients needs?\nFrom a worried and frustrated patient.

I recently returned from New Zealand and they do video appointments as standard. It seems very inefficient and old fashioned to be using online forms then calling back by phone (and without prior appointment). In my case I just wanted to quickly consult with a GP and if you had online video appointments this would be much easier for all concerned.\n\nI wrote an email to reception complaining and they did call me back and then made an phone appointment with a GP (again with no time given!) and the GP did call me and I was able to take the call when they happened to call. The GP did not seem aware that I had filled in the econsult form. \n\nGoodness knows how much this level of inefficiency costs the taxpayer and NHS! Multiple calls, emails and forms before even just getting to speak to a medical professional who could help me quickly, once I did finally get to speak to one. \n\nIn this day and age, with all the amazing digital tech we have at our disposal, this is unacceptably wasteful of everyone’s time.

I had also undergone a swab test and some blood tests.  \n\nThe duty doctor told me that all the results had come back as normal and that I needed no further treatment. I told him very clearly that I was feeling sick, dizzy and very shakey and that I felt that I could still have an infection at site of the hysterectomy. \n\nThe doctor was dismissive and said I needed no more treatment. I asked what I should do if I still felt so unwell. I asked should I go to A and E.  I again said I thought my problem was connected to my hysterectomy.  At which point the doctor said that I was forcing him into prescribing antibiotics.  He gave me a prescription, with much ill will, and finally said that if I was still ill I should go to A and E, as there we’re no further tests he could do.\n\nThe doctor’s opinion was that I forced him to prescribe antibiotics, but I was merely trying to get treatment for a problem that had left me feeling very unwell and frightened.\n\nI understand in these difficult times that it is not possible to have a consultation with the same doctor every time, but I do feel even duty doctors should show some empathy for their patients.\n","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-07-01T14:54:45","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2020-07-01T19:14:42","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/774585","id":"774585"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/774585/responses","id":"774585"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/774585/healthservices","id":"774585"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/774585/tags","id":"774585"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/g85022","id":"G85022","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frightened","id":"frightened"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/antibiotics","id":"antibiotics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood","id":"blood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20test","id":"blood test"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20tests","id":"blood tests"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/connected","id":"connected"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dizzy","id":"dizzy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hysterectomy","id":"hysterectomy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/infection","id":"infection"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/normal","id":"normal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/test","id":"test"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tests","id":"tests"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"}]},{"id":774583,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Parking ","body":"I visited this hospital this morning i drove my mother there.\nI saw many signs asking me to register my vehicle registration number to get free parking so accompaned my mother into the hospital (due to her age she is not comfortable using technology) when i arrived in the building I saw the the sign saying the parking permit scheme has been suspended \n\nThere was no signs outside the hospital building telling me of this fact - I had no need to go into the hospital myself I could have stayed in my car \n\nI was wondering while the scheme is suspended you can cover the signs \n\n","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-07-01T15:10:56","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2020-07-01T19:15:43","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/774583","id":"774583"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/774583/responses","id":"774583"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/774583/healthservices","id":"774583"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/774583/tags","id":"774583"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/r1j06","id":"R1J06","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/parking","id":"parking"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/signs","id":"signs"}]},{"id":774582,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Empty hospital.

It was very distressing and no emotional compassion was showed by staff what so ever. Not even a kind word to say I’m sorry for your loss just oh you have to pay.
