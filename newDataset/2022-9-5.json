[{"id":970914,"author":"kilonp97","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Given confidence","body":"I was referred to a Registered Mental Health Nurse for 8 weekly sessions to meet the objectives of improving my mood so that I would be more willing and able to go outdoors without feeling anxious and nervous.  \r\nPrior to commencing my online meetings I was very sceptical about attending this specialist type of treatment as I really felt I could cope on my own and that I would not benefit from someone telling me what or how to do things to make me feel and cope better. I felt it would be difficult for me to open up and speak to someone.  \r\nHowever, I have really enjoyed the sessions with my RMN who has been so kind, considerate and compassionate from day one. She made me feel at ease from day one and I feel I have built up a great rapport with her which led me to looking forward to and enjoying each session. It takes a special type of person to fulfill the role of those designated to do this job and my RMN certainly, without a doubt, is one of these genuine and caring nurses.  \r\nMy sessions have been very beneficial and by showing me different strategies, frameworks and techniques you have helped me to retrain my thoughts by implementing them and value their importance and use. They also helped me realise I did have a purpose in life which had been a big trigger point of my depression and thus a big benefit on the road to my recovery. Realising through talking and using the tools the cause, depth and manifestation has helped me to have a different and better outlook on life. Due to everything you gave me over the weeks it has gave me lots of benefits which has enabled me to move on, get over past hardships and as I feel so much better since I started my treatment I am able to look to the future. You were able to detect at the first session just how severely depressed I was which I was in denial of but when you compare my mental state now from then the proof of how these sessions work are there to see.  \r\nThank you for all your help and kindness.  \r\nThere are no negative comments about my treatment as I know and feel we have met all the objectives set at our first meeting. I am just a little sad there is no follow up to check all is going well but the treatment has given me the confidence to get help when/if I realise I am needing it.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-08-30T16:31:00.36","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-09-05T08:27:53.093","readBy":[{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2022)","count":1},{"name":"NHS Borders","count":3},{"name":"NHS Education for Scotland","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/970914","id":"970914"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/970914/responses","id":"970914"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/970914/healthservices","id":"970914"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/970914/tags","id":"970914"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sb9-community-services-oamhes","id":"SB9-community-services-oamhes","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/considerate","id":"considerate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/coping%20strategies","id":"Coping strategies"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/depression","id":"depression"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/follow%20up","id":"follow up"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kind","id":"kind"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/talking%20therapy","id":"talking therapy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassionate","id":"compassionate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confidence","id":"confidence"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20at%20ease","id":"put at ease"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scepticism","id":"scepticism"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health%20nurses","id":"mental health nurses"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/972556","id":"972556"}]},{"id":972537,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Great Care ","body":"Attended A&E  was triage  quickly , by 2 lovely members of staff .

They said that it wasn't their job to chase reports and it is up to the patient to do this, begging the question exactly what do the admin management team there do and why is this policy in place as it can only harm?  \r\nSurely this is the job of the GP admin team to chase up because I have called everyone I can and there is only so much I can do; I don't understand all the ways the NHS communicates and the GP does. It feels like all the time I get bounced between the two and at the same time my health is getting worse. I can't do this I feel too unwell .  \r\nIt turns out that there is a direct email and telephone number the GP can use for the hospital GP liaison team that the public cant use.

She has now run out of essential medications. She tried several times to contact the surgery via telephone and spent hours in queues to no avail. In the end after spending 45 minutes stuck at number 2 in a queue I drove her up to the surgery where the receptionist informed us that there were two people answering phones - she pointed to two empty seats behind her which was quite comical. No one picked up a phone in the 15 minutes we were there, so the phones - during the time they advertise us to call in, after 10am - had been left unmanned for over an hour. There may be a lack of gp's, but there is not a lack of receptionists in the uk - It not hard, you are obviously making excessive profit running a service at its bare bones - employ more.\n\nAs regards the prescription, we were told the items needed to be re authorised, which will take 5 days.

After a lengthy wait in A and E I went home. I was called by the doctor and told she would require various tests and scans. I was told I would be contacted first thing in the morning  \r\nNo communication! I tried to get through for 20 mins to eventually be told nothing had changed just the same injuries. I said I knew nothing and was incredibly upset to hear she had :  \r\n3 spinal fractures  \r\nHead injury  \r\nHaemothorax  \r\nUTI and covid  \r\nShe was taken to the surgical receiving ward 4A and had to be put into isolation.Communication is shocking, when you ask to speak to the staff I feel it is evident they can’t be bothered  \r\nI found out by chance the other day she also has a flail chest /4 broken ribs  \r\nI know they are incredibly stressed and short staffed and morale is low but how would they feel if that was their mother?  \r\nHer eyesight is poor so she can’t read a book.  \r\nI asked a nurse to check if her TV was working, to be told it probably wasn’t. I asked again if she would check, same reply. I was told I would need to get her an iPad  \r\nMum needed a bed pan, she can’t get out of bed, only to be told by a clinical support worker that she wasn’t the only patient on the ward and she would have to wait.  \r\nI know things are bad in the NHS but when did the compassion go?  \r\nI now have Covid and cannot visit my mum. There is just mum and I. So I call her and every time I call she cries and tells me she can’t take it anymore, it’s awful, like prison, she just wants to die.  \r\nI called the ward again to be answered with that’s a wee shame, I told them I was worried about her mental health, same reply.  \r\nMum has now been moved to the orthopaedic ward and what a difference. Much better room, she has a view, still no TV but she has her iPad  \r\nShe is still in a bad way but I must praise a nurse called Jackie. I wish she could be cloned!!  \r\nShe listened to my concerns, made phone calls to check on things and she called me back. She spent time talking to mum and listened to her, no one has done that so far. She made small but significant changes which have lifted mums spirits greatly. She explained about little things they could do, when I feel no one else bothered  \r\nSo Jackie, thank you so very much, what a difference you have made!!  \r\nWe need to do something about the state of the NHS . We need to boost staff morale and staff numbers to help those staff who are so stressed and overworked they have forgotten how to care.  \r\nTo help retain staff because so many are leaving a profession they have been in for years.  \r\nBut thank you Jackie for restoring my faith.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-09-02T18:11:06.5766667","progress":"Story has a

Our hospital appointment for the results is not until mid-September. Our life recently has been one of extreme worry and concern.  \r\nAfter the test, we have been playing the waiting game and imagining the worst outcomes from the test. I had to contact our GP who tried to help us get an earlier appointment for the diagnosis.

It can be very hard to get an appointment or get through on the phone lines. Some of the reception staff are very rude and cold. Constantly see different doctors depending on who is working that day and who is available. Can be very hard to follow up on long term health problems or ongoing medical treatment because of the different staff. Male doctors won't help with anything specifically regarding women's health problems so two appointments are required instead of one. The Physio is lovely and very helpful. The health care assistant and nurse are very pleasant. I like that prescriptions can be delivered to local chemists. Frustrating and inconvenient that the nurse only works in the morning for getting certain tests done or leaving in samples. The recorded message is far too long on the phone lines. Can't leave any form of message for the GP which would improve care and communication.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-08-26T00:39:44.7666667","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2022-09-05T12:20:00.32","readBy":[{"name":"Ulster University, MBBS (Medicine) 2021","count":3},{"name":"Patient and Client Council","count":1},{"name":"Public Health Agency","count":1},{"name":"Ulster University, Faculty of Life and Health Sciences","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/969911","id":"969911"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/969911/responses","id":"969911"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/969911/healthservices","id":"969911"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/969911/tags","id":"969911"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/nigp-pe1152","id":"nigp-pe1152","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frustrated","id":"frustrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/consistency","id":"consistency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dismissed","id":"dismissed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dismissive","id":"dismissive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gynaeocology","id":"gynaeocology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/impatient","id":"impatient"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/in%20pain","id":"in pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/no%20appointment","id":"no appointment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/practice%20nurse","id":"practice nurse"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/prescriptions","id":"prescriptions"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tests","id":"tests"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/urology","id":"urology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting%20room","id":"waiting room"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting%20time","id":"waiting time"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hca","id":"hca"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/women's%20health","id":"women's health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reception%20staff","id":"reception staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/busy%20phonelines","id":"busy phonelines"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/some%20of%20the%20gps","id":"some of the gps"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/still%20needing%20answers","id":"still needing answers"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/onsite%20physiotherapist","id":"onsite physiotherapist"}]},{"id":972614,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Caring Staff","body":"Within 3-4 weeks of being referred by optician I had my first cataract procedure and a week later the second.

However we were shocked to be given the diagnosis of lung cancer with bone & pulmonary metastasis and that palliative care was the only option.  \r\nMum was admitted to ward 6 from the acute medical ward for ongoing care. During her time on ward 6 mum received excellent care from one of the staff nurses. When this nurse was on shift and caring for my mum, a point was always made of updating us on mum’s condition and was always attentive to mum’s needs. They were kind, compassionate and professional at all times and is a credit to the ward. We are thankful that they were on shift a fair amount of time while mum was there as unfortunately our experience of care on ward 6 was not always positive.  \r\nMy mum was in a lot of pain but other than when the nurse mentioned was caring for mum her pain control was lacking. Most times we visited we had to ask for pain relief for mum and mum would say she couldn’t get staff’s attention as buzzer not always at hand.  \r\nOne particular day when I visited I found my mum lying on a dirty sheet and only partially covered by another also dirty sheet, she was in the same nightgown as the previous 2 days and as was the case a lot of times her IV infusion pump was alarming and not infusing. This really upset me as that is just basic care needs regardless of the fact it was a busy medical ward. My mum was bed ridden and totally dependent on staff for personal care and pain control and her condition was deteriorating rapidly. I decided at this point that I needed to make my feelings known and I asked to meet with medical staff too as mum’s pain relief was becoming more of a concern and she just wasn’t getting the care she needed and I felt she should be moved elsewhere. Thankfully I was listened to and the following day her first nurse was back caring for mum and phoned me first thing in the morning to say my concerns had been passed on and that a bed was available at Roxburghe House if I wanted mum moved. I was so relieved to hear this news and that this nurse was caring for mum again that day but I asked that they went ahead with the transfer.  \r\nMum was transferred to Roxburghe House and from admission until her sad passing she received outstanding care. All staff members were caring and compassionate and mum was finally comfortable and peaceful.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-09-02T20:30:10.87","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-09-05T12:34:06.763","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Tayside","count":14}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/972086","id":"972086"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/972086/responses","id":"972086"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/972086/healthservices","id":"972086"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/972086/tags","id":"972086"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/st9-roxburghe-house","id":"ST9-Roxburghe-House","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/t101h_430","id":"T101H_430","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/t101h-acute-medical-unit","id":"T101H-acute-medical-unit","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/t101h-palliative","id":"T101H-palliative","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bone%20cancer","id":"bone cancer"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/concerned","id":"concerned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dependent","id":"dependent"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hip%20replacement","id":"hip replacement"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lung%20cancer","id":"lung cancer"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/osteoarthritis","id":"osteoarthritis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain%20management","id":"pain management"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain%20relief","id":"pain relief"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/palliative","id":"palliative"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/personal%20care","id":"personal care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professional","id":"professional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pulmonary","id":"pulmonary"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassionate","id":"compassionate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kept%20updated","id":"kept updated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/attentive%20nurse","id":"attentive nurse"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dirty%20sheets","id":"dirty sheets"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/palliative%20care%20staff","id":"palliative care staff"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/973382","id":"973382"}]},{"id":972088,"author":"Teacher Mel","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Highest praise for all of the staff","body":"Admitted today for wide incision and node removal for breast cancer.

When I call them they tell me they can't help me and that I need to go onto their site. When I go to their site, I need special logins so that I can access the make an appointment section. To get the logins, I need to call them. I call them, they say I need to wait for my logins, which will be sent by email. I waited 6 months for those logins. Everytime I called in betweem they were of no help. The logins they send could not be more confusing, they send a an \"ID\", a \"username\", a \"password\" and a \"passphrase\". When I try to login using my password and username gain no access. After 5 attempts my accound becomes locked. Only way to unlock it? Why you have to call them of course. Guess how far I got? \n\nThis surgery should be a ashamed of how of complicated it has made it for a person to gain access to health care.

I explained that I can never get hold of the doctors, and once I finally get in the call queue, there are no appointments left for the day so I’ve asked for an appointment in advance. I had explained what the problem was to with my sons eyes and she replied “well they look fine to me!”\nI never realised the receptionist could give a medical diagnosis like that. She had then booked my baby in for an appointment a week later without even taking his name. \n \nWhen it was time for my baby to have his first round of injections, I was advised by the nurse he was unable to have his rotavirus treatment. This was because the practice had failed to log his results from his newborn blood spot test on the system however I’d had my copy of the results for weeks. After his 3rd round injections, I kept receiving appointments for his last round of jabs. I’d informed the health visitor and she said to ignore the letter, it’s obviously an error and the appointment will be cancelled when his the practice log his last round of jabs on the system. I kept receiving more and more letters and was then told that he’d have to be revaccinated. I’d then gone into the practice and the receptionist is having argument with me that I’ve wasted NHS time and the appointments could of been given to someone else. However, I did exactly what a health professional told me to do with ignoring the letters as this was an error, and I wouldn’t have been sent the letter if the practice had actually logged the vaccines on the system.

Going around in circles, keep getting cut off when in the waiting list. So far this morning have had to listen to the same answer phone message, from 2 different drs, 7 times. Unable to speak to anyone. Too busy, so no messages being taken. 111 were helpful, said dr would ring me at 9. Didnt happen. Tried again, this time 111 said it would be a 3 hour slot starting at 9 am! Didnt happen! I have been with this surgery all my life, and have never felt less cared about.I hate to have to write this kind of review. The Drs themselves are wonderful, but the system is a brick wall!","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-09-05T11:12:07","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2022-09-05T14:57:06","readBy":[{"name":"Healthwatch Cornwall","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/972704","id":"972704"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/972704/responses","id":"972704"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/972704/healthservices","id":"972704"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/972704/tags","id":"972704"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l82052","id":"L82052","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20cared%20for","id":"not cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bronchitis","id":"bronchitis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20about","id":"Cared about"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/uncomfortable","id":"uncomfortable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20for","id":"cared for"}]},{"id":972688,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"No way on telephone or online to contact","body":"Tomorrow we have an appointment that we need to confirm.

Another hour and we were number 14 in the queue. Another hour and position in the queue is 5. (How many people work answering the phones and how long do they take with each call??) We used another line to contact the department (while leaving the first on hold) and spoke to four answer phones of different secretaries. We tried to call PALS. No answer. We have emailed PALS, no answer. It looks like we will need to get in the car and drive 30 minutes, park in the hospital car park, go into the department.... at which they will say they have to talk to the patient.... who can easily phone but not easily travel today.
