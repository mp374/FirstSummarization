She liked it but wasn't sure, then recently it's became an adults with disabilities care home and she goes for respite. She's actually going and sitting in the dining room with everyone instead of having dinner in her room, as she does this at home, and she went to the lounge and went and joined in doing art in the art activity room.  \r\nThe staff are great with my daughter, she gets lots of hugs and she's happy to tell me who they are. I've never seen her come out of her shell so much and they take her to activities - ie cinema, out for walk, bowling etc.  \r\nI can go away for my wee break knowing she's getting well looked after and also the fact she's happy for me to leave her for once, the staff love her and have lots of patience with her and she's even got a soft spot for the cook.  \r\nI'm so glad I got my daughter in to this respite, it gives me a break from my her, which I need at times, and also gives her a wee break without me. I'm much happier now and the fact my daughter's happy to go to respite is a bonus and the staff are so friendly and helpful to the parents.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-08-09T17:47:53.4366667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-08-15T00:20:00.03","readBy":[{"name":"Falkirk Health & Social Care Partnership","count":5},{"name":"Office of Michelle Thomson, MSP for Falkirk East","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1102264","id":"1102264"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1102264/responses","id":"1102264"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1102264/healthservices","id":"1102264"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1102264/tags","id":"1102264"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/s37000013-thornton","id":"S37000013-thornton","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/activities","id":"activities"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/adhd","id":"adhd"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disabled","id":"disabled"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/down's%20syndrome","id":"Down's syndrome"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hearing","id":"hearing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helpful","id":"helpful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/rheumatoid%20arthritis","id":"Rheumatoid arthritis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/well%20looked%20after","id":"well looked after"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/patience","id":"patience"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thankful","id":"Thankful"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1105070","id":"1105070"}]},{"id":1104562,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"The Reception Area","body":"The reception area is your first impression of the surgery and it's extremely poor!

We are now nearly a week on. After trying to cope with paracetamol at home called FMAU. Due to symptoms including chest pain (MSK now confirmed) I was sent to A&E for investigation then sent up to FMAU - I was in from 11:00 am to 7:00pm between the two departments.  \r\nReturned the next day for more blood results. Was told at 2:45pm I was being admitted and the plan was pain relief and more tests. Couldn't fault how they were really trying to get to the bottom of the whole thing. I was became more and more distressed due to noise and light sensitivity even after the paracetamol IV.  \r\nFMAU was becoming very overwhelmed at this stage it was after 7:00 pm & I was still sitting in FMAU. At this point I had told my story to two different doctors. Feeling like I was back at square one I hadn't a clue what was going on. I hadn't been offered even a glass of water and I sent my next of kin home.  \r\nOne lady was on a trolley in labour waiting to be taken round to the labour ward. Another lady in labour getting gas and air sounding very distressed due to her pains - this is simply not good enough. They deserved privacy not sitting in a ward full of other people in discomfort. The buzzer for the door constantly going and staff chasing their tails unable to cope due to trying to find beds. Relaying on students to try and fill the gap of an already stretched service.  \r\nSo after 8 hours I was finally given a bed to \"Rest\" in a bay with mums & babies. Being told my CT scan will be at 4:00 am. Well I think I would sleep better in a children's soft play area. Everyone is being thrown in wherever they can go.  \r\nNot enough staff, not enough beds, not enough space  \r\nI am glad this will be my last child as I wouldn't want to go through all this again. As I fear this will only get more severe and with there only being one place to give birth in this trust now. You might get better facilities in a vets.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-08-11T22:35:47.7966667","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2023-08-15T08:10:47.26","readBy":[{"name":"Northern Health and Social Care Trust","count":5},{"name":"Patient and Client Council","count":1},{"name":"Public Health Agency","count":1},{"name":"Ulster University, Faculty of Life and Health Sciences","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1103486","id":"1103486"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1103486/responses","id":"1103486"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1103486/healthservices","id":"1103486"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1103486/tags","id":"1103486"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt002-ahh-fmau","id":"ZT002-ahh-fmau","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scared","id":"scared"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/beds","id":"beds"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/drinks","id":"drinks"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/labour","id":"labour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/maternity","id":"maternity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/maternity%20ward","id":"Maternity ward"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/noise","id":"noise"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain%20relief","id":"pain relief"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pregnant","id":"pregnant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/privacy","id":"privacy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/space","id":"space"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tests","id":"tests"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20shortages","id":"staff shortages"}]},{"id":1103488,"author":"cratersh47","authorRoleId":4,"authorRole":"a relative","title":"Lack of care","body":"My father arrived at A&E at Lewisham Hospital at 8:00pm last week.

I spent a total of eight months there, of which the first two were spent fighting the original infection, complicated by an abdominal problem which manifested at the same time.  \r\nI was then informed that I would be transferred to the specialist Spinal Cord Injury Unit at Musgrave Park for rehab. I hope I'm not misrepresenting the approach taken at the Ulster when I say that Physio and OT were made aware of my presence and that I might benefit from their attentions, but that as I was scheduled for rehab elsewhere it was not a priority. I should stress that I make no criticism of that policy, it makes sense in the context. Nor would I be critical that I had no regular contact with Physio during this time.  \r\nMusgrave's SCIU is the only such unit in the province, so I ended up waiting 6 months to be transferred, time which might have been wasted, indeed during which my condition may well have regressed, were it not for the intervention of one of the OTs. Jessica took it on herself to ensure I had some opportunity to start regaining strength and balance.  \r\nOn my first time out of bed in two months I was a giant rag doll, unable to sit upright for more than a few seconds. Jessica and her colleagues provided an armchair so that I could work up the number of hours I could manage upright; they had me practice basic motor skills and daily tasks like teeth cleaning and started my working towards using a board to do transitions. They were constantly professional, respectful, caring, encouraging and fun. They secured a wheelchair for me which meant I could get off the ward and get outside for the first time in months. Sometimes, if unable to come herself, Jessica had a student work on relaxation techniques.  \r\nThe upshot of this is that I arrived at Musgrave in much better shape physically and emotionally than would otherwise have been the case. There is no absolute rule, but generally 3 months is the allotted span for rehab there. Had I not benefitted from the help of my friends in OT I would estimate it would have taken me my first five or six weeks to get to the same level This in turn had a knock-on effect on what I've been able to achieve and the level of independence I can aspire to in future.  \r\nI am enormously indebted to Jessica and her colleagues.","criticality":"not

At my first appointment I met Alice and we talked about why I had been referred and what I would like to achieve. Alice warned me it would be work and to think about if this is something I wanted to tackle, and also asked if my partner would come along to the sessions with me.  \r\nMy partner then attended all the subsequent sessions. There was plenty of tears, some laughter and a lot of hard work. We had homework from every session!  \r\nWhat we thought were our initial goals shifted over the 12 sessions, and it was exactly what we didn’t know we needed. We both felt so comfortable with Alice and were never made to feel silly or ashamed. In fact is was quite the opposite. It felt like Alice really saw us both and we found the experience transformative, validating, and it has allowed us to off cast of some heavy weights we didn’t know we were carrying. We attribute this to Alice’s skill -they were warm, friendly and extremely professional.  \r\nI thought 12 sessions, one every two weeks gave us enough time to digest each session before the next one. It was a good length of time over all as it ends up being several months’ worth of therapy. I feel like I would have liked more sessions but really I know we didn’t need them. Alice had prepared us to move on.  \r\nAt the final session we were given yet more homework, and Alice helped us figure out how to continue the work we had been doing. We went on holiday not long after our sessions finished and used the time to read the books Alice recommended. It gave us the time and the space to discuss them outside of our usual routine, and have conversations in a way we would never have been able to before this journey. I am very grateful for all the support we received from Alice and this very special service.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-08-15T08:45:39.89","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2023-08-15T08:50:54.903","readBy":[],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1104578","id":"1104578"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1104578/responses","id":"1104578"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1104578/healthservices","id":"1104578"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1104578/tags","id":"1104578"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/tah-rss","id":"TAH-RSS","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gynae","id":"gynae"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/length%20of%20sessions","id":"length of sessions"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/relationships","id":"relationships"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sexual%20health","id":"sexual health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/therapist","id":"therapist"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/validated","id":"validated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"}]},{"id":1103503,"author":"authenticsf94","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Still waiting for MRI results after 10 weeks","body":"I was diagnosed with bowel cancer in May and sent for an MRI at the start of June.

After taking painkillers of different types for at least 10 yrs and wearing a support sacroilliac belt 24/7 using tens machine and Ibroprofen gel and buying a mobility scooter; it was a great result only after three visits and doing the exercises at home regularly that I have found relief I thought I would never have.  \r\nSince seeing Isobel I have managed to reduce my painkiller intake , stopped wearing the belt (only after perhaps heavy lifting or activity), use of the scooter has also reduced around the supermarket.  \r\nWorking together with sobel has been a great experience!!  \r\nThank you so much","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-08-12T12:04:23.87","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-08-15T09:45:21.523","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Dumfries and Galloway","count":3}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1103517","id":"1103517"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1103517/responses","id":"1103517"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1103517/healthservices","id":"1103517"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1103517/tags","id":"1103517"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/y144h-physiotherapy","id":"y144h-physiotherapy","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diagnosis","id":"diagnosis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/excellent%20care","id":"excellent care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/exercises","id":"exercises"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/great%20experience","id":"Great experience"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mobility","id":"mobility"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/painkillers","id":"painkillers"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/physio","id":"physio"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/physiotherapy","id":"physiotherapy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/relieved","id":"relieved"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stuck","id":"stuck"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1104608","id":"1104608"}]},{"id":1103531,"author":"crater65","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Very happy with the way I was treated.","body":"A few days ago I had an appointment for a vaginal ultrasound.

Why are they asking you what do you want after telling staff repeatedly in assessments and waiting 7.5 months for something from them, and with a GP referral telling them. They can change goalposts because they can. I have seen 3 different people and I want to wear a sweatshirt that says Not Again.Do not expect to get treated, you won't get treated.With them, it's like a heart surgeon having to ask someone else what to do all the time - would you want that surgeon to operate on you? You come away not feeling reassured. I am not saying that they don't come across as nice people but I don't care. I want help and I want it asap. You will get assessments and delays to the point where you will completely lose the will to live and they will furnish you with a reason that will make you feel way worse than when you first approached and you will start to doubt yourself and why would anyone put themselves through such upheaval and distress just to access help. They cause you to deteriorate. It's not rocket science but mental health can wait and wait and wait at St Marys. This is how they operate - tough. Why is such a crucial service allowed to get away with this?The place is mainly backed up by answer phones and if you can find one person who know staff members or where the hell they are located, good luck. Nobody knows who anyone is. I have been transferred numerous times to the wrong departments (answer phones) and it is confused with St Mary's hospital at times too. It's little things but they need to get their \"reception\" act together and certain teams are totally confusing to their own staff! This is not a timely service. It wastes time on assessments and faffing about. What is the cost of this? Assessments I have found awful and so far in my case; they have not got me anywhere and I do not know what to do because I can't face another one.Assessments are hugely triggering but there is no support post assessment whatsoever. I have had no outcome - after 7.5 months I have no date or idea when my 4th!!! assessment will be. (They want another one). I expect to be told eventually that they can't treat me and they will have some reason. (Sorry if I'm cynical but I have had zilch progress - nothing is happening and I'm at my wit's end).They tell me they want to get it right but I'm sick of being asked to put my hand in the meat grinder again. I can't see any light at the end of the tunnel.I'm afraid to tell them what I think to their face because they have all the power over my treatment and they know this and I know this.It's all about the service and the least important person is the patient (despite what they say) and telling them anything about what triggers you is a waste of time, a complete and utter waste of time.I should have walked out of the last assessment.Would I recommend them - no. I'd like to see something concrete from them after putting me through this process. I can't go through another \"assessment\" because I feel demolished after the last one and I'm getting nowhere with how things are being set up supposedly to help me.","criticality":"moderately

I was number 2 in line and still it took 46 minutes to get through to someone.\r\n\r\nThe prior week I went into the surgery to book a same day appointment not aware that they no longer offer bookings onsite. The receptionist kindly booked an appointment for 11:10am as I was there already she said. I asked if I could wait and remained on site and was told yes. At 11:22am I approached the same reception to query the appointment as the time had passed and I wasn't called. She looked on the system and said she didn't understand what happened but would check. Other people were in line so she asked me to have a seat. She then attended to two people and although I made a point to sit in her line of vision, she seemed to have forgotten me eventhough she also passed by me twice. Another 30 minutes, I rejoined the reception line and was approached by another member of staff who had noticed I had been in the surgery for over 2 hours. This person seemed concerned and proceeded to help by asking another receptionist to check. Apparently, I was noted as not attended even though I never left the surgery, this was due to that I was never checked in by the first receptionist and same one who said she didn't know what happened and would check. This more helpful member of staff apologised and proceeded to check with the doctor to let him know and ask if I could be seen. The doctor saw me and I'm grateful. I was however upset that the first receptionist could not own her error and be honest and take the same actions as the member of staff who helped instead of being dishonest and then ignoring me. \r\n\r\nI've been with this surgery for nearly 20 years now but in recent times its become more challenging and confusing to deal with.

When I was suffering a loss of confidence I was continually re-assured and even the criticism was good-hearted.\r\nThe only downside was the pressure exerted on me to vacate the bed. Strangely this first arose when I was suffering a period of hypotension, had little confidence regarding my mobility and was certainly not suitable for safe discharge. My wife and I had a proposition for my discharge but it seemed that only the hospital's plan was acceptable so the pressure continued. Fortunately, however, thanks to a perceptive, skilful and flexible tradesman, we were able to make changes at home and  test them to ensure that all safety issues were covered. I was therefore able to be discharged, probably some 48hrs earlier than following hospital strategy. I was able to save a not insubstantial sum of money and the stress and hassle of purchasing new furniture along with the removal/storage of existing furniture. More importantly, I returned home to continue my recuperation in near-normal circumstances - a huge psychological bonus.\r\nOverall, I felt that I was in best place and could not have received better care.\r\nThank you Team NGH, you were superb!","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2023-08-11T21:07:55","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2023-08-15T11:34:15","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1104657","id":"1104657"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1104657/responses","id":"1104657"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1104657/healthservices","id":"1104657"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1104657/tags","id":"1104657"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rhqng","id":"RHQNG","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stress","id":"stress"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/better","id":"better"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mobility","id":"mobility"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/normal","id":"normal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20good","id":"not good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/safe","id":"safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/test","id":"test"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confidence","id":"confidence"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/loss%20of%20confidence","id":"loss of confidence"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thanks","id":"thanks"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/assured","id":"assured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/no%20confidence","id":"no confidence"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/motivated","id":"motivated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20safe","id":"very safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/under%20pressure","id":"under pressure"}]},{"id":1104661,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Appointment cancelled ","body":"I've got appointment in one month in advance and received message that my appointment been cancelled without my permission,also I've been calling to reception and they have been rood to me,thinking to change GP\r\n","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2023-08-11T21:11:10","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2023-08-15T11:34:23","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1104661","id":"1104661"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1104661/responses","id":"1104661"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1104661/healthservices","id":"1104661"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1104661/tags","id":"1104661"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/e85680","id":"E85680","score":null}]},{"id":1104656,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Excellent service and team ","body":"I was incredibly pleased with the care I received at Withington Hospital. \r\n\r\nAfter sustaining an injury at work, the plastics team were able to see me the next morning and I had my surgery the same afternoon.

The result is that I'm back on a waiting list since April to be seen, and living with around 17 hours of pain each day, when in reality and my past history I don't feel I should have been discharged.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-08-13T10:56:19.7933333","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2023-08-15T12:20:30.163","readBy":[{"name":"Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust ","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1103910","id":"1103910"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1103910/responses","id":"1103910"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1103910/healthservices","id":"1103910"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1103910/tags","id":"1103910"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rhqhh_502","id":"RHQHH_502","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frustrated","id":"frustrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20cared%20for","id":"not cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/worried","id":"worried"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/growth","id":"growth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gynae","id":"gynae"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ovarian%20cyst","id":"ovarian cyst"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scan","id":"scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting%20time","id":"waiting time"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/left%20in%20pain","id":"left in pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back%20to%20square%20one","id":"back to square one"}]}]
