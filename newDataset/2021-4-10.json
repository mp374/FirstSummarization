My mother spend two hours trying to get through to the surgery yesterday to chase up her second Covid injection as her three months since the first one ends on 19 April and she has heard nothing. When she finally got through she was told that appointments are not being made for that far in advance (just over a week - really?!) and was told by the receptionist that she would have to wait for her text and then, as she does not have a smart phone she would have to phone back to make her appointment. So another two hours on hold awaits her, assuming she can actually get through at all - when she booked her first injection, she sat in a telephone queue for an hour, selected the option on the automated system 'to book a Covid injection' at which point it just told her that 'this service is not currently available' and cut her off. She tried this four times on different days and at different times of the day. I have no idea when this service 'is currently available'. She then she got wise and selected the option to speak to a receptionist and then waited another hour to do so - a handy tip for anybody else trying to book their jab. Still, her telephone provider will be very happy, as it's earning well out of this. It's simply not acceptable to blame this lack of service on Covid. I have friends  of the same age who are lucky enough to be registered at a practice in Rainham, and not only are they able to get through to make an appointment of a GP consultation when they need to, the GP has also called them unbidden to check in on them. Needless to say, they have had both of their jabs. Patients registered at The Thorndike Centre can only dream of this kind of service, but it is obviously achievable by other busy practices affected by Covid.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2021-04-09T08:58:51","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-04-10T11:09:07","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/838073","id":"838073"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/838073/responses","id":"838073"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/838073/healthservices","id":"838073"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/838073/tags","id":"838073"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/g82095","id":"G82095","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/injection","id":"injection"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lucky","id":"lucky"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happy","id":"happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid","id":"covid"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20happy","id":"not happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%2019","id":"covid 19"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/838576","id":"838576"}]},{"id":838072,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Above & Beyond","body":"I visited Dermatology early today without an appointment and in a state of panic after undergoing a procedure yesterday.

On going after effects explained with reassurances that all will get better in time, hence thank you is not enough for Budbrooke Medical Centre and of course all the wonderful people working for the NHS.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2021-04-09T23:26:48","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2021-04-10T13:00:55","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/838086","id":"838086"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/838086/responses","id":"838086"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/838086/healthservices","id":"838086"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/838086/tags","id":"838086"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/m84069","id":"M84069","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/concern","id":"concern"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cancer","id":"cancer"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cancer%20treatment","id":"cancer treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/earache","id":"earache"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/excellent","id":"excellent"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pharmacy","id":"Pharmacy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ultrasound","id":"ultrasound"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wonderful","id":"wonderful"}]},{"id":838092,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Amazing practice ","body":"Had vaccination today very well organised and amazing staff keeping people safe and reassuring them if worried 10+ stars!","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2021-04-09T21:01:04","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-04-10T13:01:30","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/838092","id":"838092"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/838092/responses","id":"838092"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/838092/healthservices","id":"838092"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/838092/tags","id":"838092"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/f81057","id":"F81057","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/worried","id":"worried"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/safe","id":"safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vaccination","id":"vaccination"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing","id":"amazing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20worried","id":"not worried"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/891252","id":"891252"}]},{"id":838091,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Unable to get through on the telephone","body":"i have recently been given medication following a telephone conversation with a doctor who seemed to think I had missed a previous call.

I understand at the time i got told it takes 2 weeks to be registered which was fine at the time. I am 12 weeks pregnant and i got a call from my midwife saying i have a urine infection and need antibiotics. I told her i have just registered and have been told it will take 2 weeks. she told me to contact the practice and explain the situation and just get an email from them so she can send the information so that i can get my prescription to which i did. my midwife then contacted me this morning to say she had a reply back from the practice to say im not registered patient at the practice. I then had to call the practice again explain the whole situation to then be told they will register me over the phone. Once they did that i then got told the doctor will call me on monday between 9am and 11am at this point i was getting annoyed and responded by saying i am pregnant i have an infection i need antibiotics you have the email from my midwife can a doctor just action it to which i got told they dont have the email as i wasn't registered. i responded by saying i am registered now over the phone so what if i get my midwife to resend the email to which they still said no and said we dont have any appointments today so it will have to be on monday. I then hung up the phone and called my midwife who was apalled by what i was told and said the fact the practice was saying they didnt have the email was untrue as she got a reply from them to say i wasnt registered. I then left it to my midwife to contact the practice. Once she had she called me back and she was annoyed she said she had an arguement with whoever she spoke to at the practice and instead she had contacted the hospital registrar and got the prescription done for me but i would have to pick it up from the hospital pharmacy. I understand they couldnt do anything by me speaking to them but this was another healthcare professional contacting them which is absolutely appalling and unproffessional. This also  meant that i had to take time off work finish work early to then go from ilford to leytonstone by tube and bus as i dont drive to go to the hospital and pick up my antibiotics. I am very upset and annoyed and lets say i will be looking to register elsewhere because if i was treated like this over the phone whats it going to be like when im registered and need appointments. I would not reccomend this practice to anybody!","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2021-04-09T19:20:22","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-04-10T13:12:44","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/838100","id":"838100"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/838100/responses","id":"838100"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/838100/healthservices","id":"838100"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/838100/tags","id":"838100"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/f86696","id":"F86696","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/annoyed","id":"annoyed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appalling","id":"appalling"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20upset","id":"very upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/antibiotics","id":"antibiotics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/infection","id":"infection"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pharmacy","id":"Pharmacy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pregnant","id":"pregnant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fine","id":"fine"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/945092","id":"945092"}]},{"id":838099,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Efficient ","body":"Went for my second AZ vaccine and was very impressed with the efficiecy and displine and way everything was organised.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2021-04-10T08:54:12","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2021-04-10T13:13:00","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/838099","id":"838099"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/838099/responses","id":"838099"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/838099/healthservices","id":"838099"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/838099/tags","id":"838099"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/e83053","id":"E83053","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/impressed","id":"impressed"}]},{"id":838098,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Answer the phone!","body":"While I understand that the NHS is extremely stretched, I’m still disgusted by the lack of empathy and communication I’ve received.

It would only accept card payments. After eventually reaching my partner to bring a card to use we eventually managed to pay fee guestimated.\nThis performance put me under great pressure to reach the outpatients department on time for my appointment. Being hot and bothered is not really an advisable state to be in when attending an Hospital appointment. Can I please ask that Buckland Hospital to considers the system used at Ashford and Canterbury Hospitals.  Importantly you only pay for the time of use of the car park instead of having to guess how long you will need to be parked there.
