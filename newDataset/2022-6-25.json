When phoning up a few weeks ago for an appointment with my doctor, I was only allowed to speak to a clinician who said they would refer me to the mental health team, yet I never heard anything. It took an a&e trip to get any form of service, and even after that and after explaining that counselling would be beneficial, I was referred to the wrong place (a crisis line) when i was told it would be counselling. When attempting to get my medication in the past, I was not allowed to go through the NHS app when ordering my prescription, yet when ringing I was interrupted many times by the reception team as they told me to order my prescription online even though I could not do so because I have to speak to a doctor first every time. It has led to me being without my medication for over a week multiple times, causing awful side effects. When I attempted to see a doctor due to having tonsillitis, I was told that it would actually be easier for me to phone 111 and go to a&e just for some antibiotics, rather than get an appointment with a practitioner. I changed to this GP when moving to Huddersfield for university in September and it has been disappointing from the start.

They are hugely helpful and it really works if you follow the steps.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-06-24T19:44:09","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2022-06-25T15:23:23","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/950874","id":"950874"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/950874/responses","id":"950874"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/950874/healthservices","id":"950874"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/950874/tags","id":"950874"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/e82031","id":"E82031","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/understood","id":"understood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20great","id":"not great"}]},{"id":950873,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Caring and considerate","body":"I am now in that position where my parents are coming to the end of their life .

From checking in to being seen, the staff were utterly amazing. My son was having breathing issues and was monitored and examined thoroughly the whole time we were there. The doctors were called out to an emergency and our wait became longer however the staff made sure we were comfortable and checked in on us informing us of delays. No issue with this as the severity of my sons illness clearly paled in comparison to the emergency. We were seen by 2 wonderful drs and looked after by a just as wonderful nurse. I was very exhausted so can’t remember their names (apologies). The staff never stopped and the waiting rooms in both adult and paediatrics continued to be full all day/night. It would be easy for any of the staff to be rushed/ stressed and very stand of fish due to how busy they were but I never felt this at all. I felt my son was cared for, they genuinely had concern for him and investigated his issues thoroughly enough that they were able to identify issues and set us on the right path to him feeling better.\nThank you for all you do.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-06-24T21:47:44","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-06-25T16:03:47","readBy":[{"name":"The Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/950883","id":"950883"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/950883/responses","id":"950883"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/950883/healthservices","id":"950883"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/950883/tags","id":"950883"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rtd02","id":"RTD02","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/concern","id":"concern"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20cared%20for","id":"not cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stressed","id":"stressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/better","id":"better"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breathing","id":"breathing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20about","id":"Cared about"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency","id":"emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/exhausted","id":"exhausted"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/looked%20after","id":"looked after"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/paediatric","id":"paediatric"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/paediatrics","id":"paediatrics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/rushed","id":"rushed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20for","id":"cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/comfortable","id":"comfortable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20looked%20after","id":"not looked after"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/952131","id":"952131"}]},{"id":950886,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Great doctors","body":"An exasperating and difficult experience trying to arrange a telephone triage. For a routine case the receptionist eventually, against my judgement,  referred me to an urgent service.  The urgent service duly phoned and,  as I had expected,  said they could not deal with routine cases.   They were very helpful and made a mutually agreeable evening appt for a telephone consultation.  I then received another receptionist's call not only notifying me that the urgent team should not have made the appt for me but also advising that 'appointments cannot be made for the benefit of the patients!!'.  I duly cancelled my request for a telephone triage only to get a triage call on the following working day from the GP.  Not expecting this my phone was on silent.  It was fortunate that I just happened to be looking at something on my phone when the call came in otherwise it would have been missed. \nI was advised by the receptionist that I HAD to consult to my own GP on either a Mon or Thurs, neither of those dates being suitable for me. \nWhen I did speak to my GP she was excellent and offered to see me in person the following day, a Tues, not a date offered by the receptionist.   My GP was extremely thorough and helpful.  I have nothing but praise for her.

Everything was clean and tidy and in ship shape order. \n\nI cant thank everybody enough for looking after me throughout my day surgery and I hope that they at least get hear this feedback to say what a great job they are doing.\n","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-06-25T08:45:11","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-06-25T21:01:22","readBy":[{"name":"University Hospitals Dorset NHS Foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/950901","id":"950901"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/950901/responses","id":"950901"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/950901/healthservices","id":"950901"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/950901/tags","id":"950901"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/r0d02","id":"R0D02","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/day%20surgery","id":"day surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/elbow","id":"elbow"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/looked%20after","id":"looked after"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/safe","id":"safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/welcome","id":"welcome"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hope","id":"Hope"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/no%20hope","id":"no hope"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20safe","id":"very safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20looked%20after","id":"not looked after"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20great","id":"not great"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/955376","id":"955376"}]},{"id":950908,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Chaotic micro management","body":"I had several mobility problems and went to see my GP in Nov 2021. Was referred to MSK London. From first offered appointment in March 2022, every single problem was handled at a different dates, at a different location with extremely varying levels of competence and a complete breakdown in communication between the various departments and locations. It doesn't help if doctors can't keep proper records. They don't listen and they certainly don't like being asked questions.\nSeven months on, I am told (for one complaint) \"I don't know what it is, so how about a cortisone injection?\". Really? In physiotherapy, isn't the usual approach \"if there is no trauma, then look for bad habits\"? Well, there never was any search for a change in lifestyle or (new) bad habits.\nWell, at least, thanks to hours of searching on the internet, I have found a way of getting through the night relatively painlessly. So that is not thanks to your services. And I am regaining some mobility, thanks to gentle, very gentle yoga classes (which I pay for) and a chance remark from a radiologist friend abroad which put me on the right track. Yes, a bad habit crept in as a result of Covid obliging me to work exclusively from behind my desktop computer. \nAs for one of the other complaints, there is been no improvement at all, despite telephone diagnosis and exercices. So perhaps the diagnosis is wrong. Perhaps it is not the gluteus medius and maximus at all, but the piriformis and the long dorsals???\nBut then, don't blame the physiotherapist who is forced to diagnose without being able to see the patient move or feel where and how much resistance there is in a joint.\nMind you, NONE of the persons I have met has actually bothered to look at how I move. Is that serious physiotherapy?????\nIt is a waste of my time, my tax money. And it must be very frustrating for more seriously minded medical staff too.\nSo after 7 months, I still don't know what is going wrong, why and what the best way might be to live with the pain crises. And can I avoid the problems getting worse? I have the impression that after a certain age, the NHS would rather see us inactive, discretely dying out of sight. And of course, we can't possibly remember things accurately. Well, I want my life back!\nBecause I had 4 problems and because these were tele-micromanaged, I have no idea to which appointments your customer satisfaction and health forms related. What I do know is that one of them has now embedded itself in my computer and pops up on the front page every time I open Google Chrome.\nAnd, eh, how about fewer leading questions on that form. Example: \"How many times this week did you need help\". That is presuming there is help at hand. Perhaps you should add: \"And was that help available?\".","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-06-24T15:52:38","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-06-25T21:01:31","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/950908","id":"950908"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/950908/responses","id":"950908"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/950908/healthservices","id":"950908"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/950908/tags","id":"950908"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/nmk","id":"NMK","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frustrating","id":"frustrating"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breakdown","id":"breakdown"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diagnose","id":"diagnose"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diagnosis","id":"diagnosis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dying","id":"dying"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hand","id":"hand"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/in%20pain","id":"in pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/injection","id":"injection"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/joint","id":"joint"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mobility","id":"mobility"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/physiotherapy","id":"physiotherapy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sight","id":"sight"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waste%20of%20time","id":"waste of time"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doing%20well","id":"doing well"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/worse%20than%20before","id":"worse than before"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid","id":"covid"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%2019","id":"covid 19"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/951445","id":"951445"}]},{"id":950904,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Helpful team of staff ","body":"I visited the surgery four times this month and all the staff I met were caring, thorough and helpful.\nI left each time feeling better and confident that they were sorting out my medical problems ","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-06-25T09:01:42","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2022-06-25T21:02:43","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/950904","id":"950904"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/950904/responses","id":"950904"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/950904/healthservices","id":"950904"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/950904/tags","id":"950904"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/m81063","id":"M81063","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/better","id":"better"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confident","id":"confident"}]},{"id":950903,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"An excellent practice","body":"The doctors, nurses and reception staff are all very approachable and appear to do the very best for their patients.

This man is incredible and we need more doctors like this in the UK!  \r\nI initially went in to discuss a lump I had discovered in my breast which I was very nervous about as was unsure what to expect at my appointment. He instantly made me feel at ease with his lovely chit chat and very informative about what to expect during my examination/appointment. Any further questions I asked were answered in full detail (he is very knowledgeable!) and I never felt like my appointment was being rushed.  \r\nDr Osen also made me feel very comfortable during my examination and carried himself with great professionalism. He also took his time during my appointment to understand more about my personal circumstances/ mental health which I was not expecting to be discussed in the detail that Dr Osen went into. This really means a lot to me! In the past I have doctors who have shrugged off mental health conversations and not checked in on their patients well being.  \r\nDr Osen showed great empathy and understanding towards my emotions -. I really needed that chat today and I have left my appointment feeling like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders... along with a plan from the doctor to identify the lump'in my breast and a plan to improve my mental health.  \r\nThank you so much Dr Osen - keep up the hard work because we need more people like you! You are amazing at what you do!  \r\nI would also like to make a comment to The Wick Health Centre in general because the team on reception are also wonderful and always very polite. I was seen incredibly quickly as well (which also includes the team booking appointments in for me at Homerton Hospital in super speedy time!).
