They are all very caring and great at providing rehabilitation as it was needed due to having a stroke not so long ago.  \r\nThis was a scary experience for me as it was my first one but staff have been very good at talking to me about this and trying to reassure me and support me through this difficult time. They have also been a great source of comfort and support to my family which really means a lot and shows that they not only take care of the patient but our loved ones as well. Margaret and Emily have been there for me throughout and they are my main nurses who come in and check on me and keep my family up-to-date. They have helped guide my family through the maze of supporting me after my stroke. They have worked very long hours with no complaints, and have always kept very positive on shift!  \r\nThe physios that also come in to me have been working very hard to help me get walking again and have been going beyond the norm to support me.  \r\nThey all had to work through these difficult times of covid with no complaints at all. Although I cannot wait to be discharge, the team has been absolutely fantastic and I wouldn’t want anyone else to care for me other than them. Thank you to all of them!","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-01-22T14:24:36.72","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-01-25T09:25:25.827","readBy":[{"name":"Southern Health and Social Care Trust","count":3}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1020702","id":"1020702"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1020702/responses","id":"1020702"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1020702/healthservices","id":"1020702"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1020702/tags","id":"1020702"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_32024-south","id":"ZT003_32024-south","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/above%20and%20beyond","id":"above and beyond"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/caring","id":"caring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/family%20support","id":"family support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/positive","id":"positive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/rehabilitation","id":"rehabilitation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stroke","id":"stroke"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fantastic","id":"fantastic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/physios","id":"physios"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/explanations","id":"explanations"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/great%20team","id":"great team"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kept%20updated","id":"kept updated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hard%20working%20staff","id":"hard working staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/over%20and%20above","id":"over and above"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1021822","id":"1021822"}]},{"id":1021808,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Best surgery","body":"All staff and doctors are very helpful.

The treatment was timely , fully explained and effective. The doctors , nurses and all staff were kind, caring, available ,efficient and very hard working. It’s impossible to pick out any one member of staff as nothing was too much trouble for anyone on any of the wards.\nThe communication between departments was excellent, everything was thought through, followed up and executed in a timely manner. Astounding for a service under such pressure. \nThe discharge support on ward 3c was exceptional. We wanted to get dad home as quickly as possible with a care package that kept him safe at home. This meant him staying in hospital for a couple of days after he was fit to discharge. In a very busy ward, we were helped to arrange an appointment at another hospital while: including arranging an ambulance transfer on a strike day. The assistance received from the discharge team to organise things including living aids, checks inside the hospital,medication advice was way above  and beyond you could ever expect in a service under so much pressure. \nWe can’t thank everyone enough for saving dads life , getting his infection under control and getting him safely home with the minimum of fuss and the maximum of goodwill . \n","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2023-01-24T23:05:26","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-01-25T09:33:01","readBy":[{"name":"St Helens and Knowsley Hospitals NHS Trust","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1021802","id":"1021802"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1021802/responses","id":"1021802"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1021802/healthservices","id":"1021802"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1021802/tags","id":"1021802"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rbn01","id":"RBN01","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/get%20fit","id":"get fit"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helped","id":"helped"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/in%20control","id":"in control"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/infection","id":"infection"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20good","id":"not good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/out%20of%20control","id":"out of control"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/safe","id":"safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20safe","id":"very safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/in%20the%20way","id":"in the way"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/under%20pressure","id":"under pressure"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1022718","id":"1022718"}]},{"id":1021801,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Very good and informative ","body":"It's the best explanation I have ever had of my forthcoming procedure at any hospital or doctors practice any where over my life time super well done pre op department all staff thank you","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2023-01-24T23:12:32","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-01-25T09:33:32","readBy":[{"name":"Lancashire Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1021801","id":"1021801"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1021801/responses","id":"1021801"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1021801/healthservices","id":"1021801"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1021801/tags","id":"1021801"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rxn02","id":"RXN02","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doing%20well","id":"doing well"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1022573","id":"1022573"}]},{"id":1021807,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Outstanding ","body":"Always a cheerful, patient and accommodating greeting and service from the reception /admin team.

Nursing staff lovely and good advocates.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-01-22T19:51:36.8933333","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2023-01-25T09:38:08.453","readBy":[],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1020753","id":"1020753"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1020753/responses","id":"1020753"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1020753/healthservices","id":"1020753"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1020753/tags","id":"1020753"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rwy01_180","id":"RWY01_180","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/concern","id":"concern"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/a&e","id":"a&e"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back%20pain","id":"back pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctor","id":"doctor"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nursing%20staff","id":"nursing staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain%20relief","id":"pain relief"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/planning","id":"planning"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attitude","id":"staff attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting%20times","id":"waiting times"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/walk","id":"walk"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassion","id":"compassion"}]},{"id":1021803,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Superb quality and professionalism ","body":"I moved to the area 4 months ago and was apprehensive about moving GP’s and the practice staff as well.\nAs I have a number of health issues, it has been a brilliant experience to be treated so remarkably professional and with kindness and understanding.\nI really feel as though the whole team care and my fears have been dispelled.\nI can wholeheartedly recommend this practice without any reservations.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2023-01-25T00:00:24","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-01-25T09:38:20","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1021803","id":"1021803"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1021803/responses","id":"1021803"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1021803/healthservices","id":"1021803"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1021803/tags","id":"1021803"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/m83020","id":"M83020","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/apprehensive","id":"apprehensive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doing%20well","id":"doing well"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1022748","id":"1022748"}]},{"id":1020847,"author":"melonyg67","authorRoleId":3,"authorRole":"a parent/guardian","title":"Thank you all for making it as stress free as possible","body":"I took my toddler son to A&E at PRI recently where he was diagnosed with a tibia fracture after a fall.

I used the words \"killing myself is an option\" and this was not even acknowledged.

The treatment I received was excellent, After an MRI scan several broken vertebra were detected.  \r\nMy pain relief was reviewed and adjusted, with good effective results. A consultant clearly explained that no hospital treatment other than pain relief was available, which would allow me to function until nature healed the bones.  \r\nI was then diagnosed with osteoporosis and future treatment would be arranged. The hospital then carried out comprehensive assessment of my ability to care for myself at home. I was told I was fully competent and safe and sufficiently mobile with aid of walking frame for independent living and my premises were safe and fit for purpose.  \r\nI was then told I would be discharged home. Shortly afterwards two porters arrived with wheelchair and I was taken to discharge lounge. All my belongings were assembled and checked correct, and I was given supply of new pain relief prescription and directed to comfortable chair and given hot drink to await ambulance. I felt my treatment up to this point was excellent.  \r\nAfter a short wait an ambulance driver called for me and I was taken to ambulance by wheelchair and transferred to seat in ambulance. I expected to be driven home a short distance about 3 miles. I was surprised to to be driven a much shorter distance and stopped in front of a large building with sign over Opal house. I had never head of this but assumed it was a secondary ambulance waiting area. I was wheeled inside past a reception desk although none of the staff spoke to me I was wheeled into a large lounge area and deposited in a rather uncomfortable chair at the rear. The ambulance man then left. I had no walking frame so I was unable to move from that spot.  \r\nAfter a wait of around 2 hours no one had attempted in any way to communicate with me other than catering assistant who offered hot drink. I had never before heard of Opal house with no idea at all of its function, or why I had been taken there. I understood that I had been formally discharged from Wythenshaw hospital to be taken home.  \r\nI eventually managed to attract the attention of someone in a nurses uniform, I enquired where was I and why, and when was my ambulance coming to take me home. They replied that I was at opal house for assessment. In further conversation I was told opal house was an assessment centre and had no direct connection to wWthenshaw hospital. Assessment was expected to take a week or more.  \r\nI was devastated at this and explained I had been fully assessed as safe for discharge home, and had been told by both a hospital consultant and a doctor that I was to be discharged directly home. There was never any mention of any sort of further assessment centre, or any sort of consultation, I did not know such an establishment existed. I said I wanted to leave and be taken home.  \r\nI was then told I could not leave and was cautioned not to attempt this as access door was locked and would not be unlocked for me. I then realised that I had been transferred without my knowledge or permission to some sort of unknown assessment centre, and I was now behind locked doors.  \r\nI repeated my desire to leave and be taken home immediately. The nurse then left, and some time later I was approached by another nurse in a different uniform which I assumed meant they were some kind of supervisor. They asked for confirmation that I wanted to leave which I confirmed. They then stated that I was self discharging and the NHS was had no further duty of care, nor would an ambulance be provided. However, as a courtesy, a taxi would be provided to take me home.  \r\nI was then completely confused, how could I self discharge from an organisation which a few minutes ago did not know existed nor had I completed or consented to any form of admission procedure?  \r\nSome 2 hours later with no sign of promised taxi I telephoned my son who was approaching end of his work shift, and asked him to collect me. When my son arrived I was again told I could not leave as the shift was changing - I did not see how this was relevant to allowing me to go. Some time later I was told I could go. I again protested that a small car was not suitable transportation for patient with severe pelvic and spinal injuries I also expressed my concern at anticipated difficulty of transfer from car to house in the dark with plummeting below freezing temperature a snow and ice covered sloping driveway. this was an obvious significant safety hazard for me. The reply was the NHS no longer had any duty of care and that no ambulance would be provided.  \r\nI then transferred myself with some difficulty from wheelchair to car and was driven slowly home. I was initially optimistic of my ability to walk with aid of frame from car to house with support from my son, the distance was a little less than that negotiated in hospital assessments. However the conditions were very different I was very very cold in flimsy hospital pyjamas. Just over half way I became exhausted and my legs started to buckle. My son was unable to prevent me falling to ground. My son then obtained assistance from neighbours who managed to get me into my living room. Probable damage from this fall has yet to be fully assessed.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-01-24T20:15:55.7266667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-01-25T10:27:14.733","readBy":[{"name":"Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1021544","id":"1021544"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1021544/responses","id":"1021544"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1021544/healthservices","id":"1021544"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1021544/tags","id":"1021544"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/r0a07_110","id":"R0A07_110","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/r0a07-opal-house","id":"R0A07-opal-house","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/concern","id":"concern"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frustrated","id":"frustrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/broken","id":"broken"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/concerned","id":"concerned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/excellent%20care","id":"excellent care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fall","id":"fall"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly%20staff","id":"friendly staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hospital%20discharge","id":"hospital discharge"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/in%20pain","id":"in pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/injury","id":"injury"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/legs","id":"legs"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mri%20scan","id":"MRI scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/osteoporosis","id":"osteoporosis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain%20relief","id":"pain relief"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pelvic","id":"pelvic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scan","id":"scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/spinal","id":"spinal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attitude","id":"staff attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surprised","id":"surprised"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vertebra","id":"vertebra"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting%20time","id":"waiting time"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/walk","id":"walk"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/walking","id":"walking"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/walking%20aid","id":"walking aid"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wheelchair","id":"wheelchair"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/transport","id":"transport"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/injuries","id":"injuries"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1024793","id":"1024793"}]},{"id":1020788,"author":"Anxious relation","authorRoleId":4,"authorRole":"a relative","title":"The care of patients","body":"I just read a story on your site from three years ago about the nursing care on one of the Vascular wards in Morriston Hospital, Swansea. I’m not sure what happened as a result of the author's concern at the time but things do not seem to have improved.  \r\nLike him I have found the vascular team helpful but the nursing regime is poor indeed. Not only has it been tantamount to negligent, the demeanour and attitude of some of the senior staff has been confrontational, defensive and failing to understand the case before discussing it.  \r\nThey have attempted to discuss my relatives case with us from a position of certainty when it has become self evident they have not read the notes or familiarised themselves with the detail.  \r\nCommunication and coordination of care has been poor. A determination to rush to prioritise discharge has blinded the nursing staff to the obvious.  \r\nSince expressing concerns through an intermediary things have improved somewhat but I can’t help feeling it’s because the nursing staff now feel under scrutiny.  \r\nIt is appalling that at a time of great stress we have had to divert energy and time to countering the deficiencies in the nursing by having to raise such concerns.  \r\nGiven the similarity between my experience and the author from 3 years ago I can’t help but feel nothing has been learnt and the deficiencies must be at a leadership and institutional level.  \r\nDealing with individual cases without seeing them as an example of systemic and leadership failure will not save people like us having to suffer repeated experiences of neglect and poor nursing care.  \r\nFor clarity I am not referring to ward R. It all falls far short of what we should expect from the nursing professionals.  \r\nI recognise the strain in the system and the pressure on individuals but we can’t allow this to be a hiding place for bad practice. In spite of the constrains we should be able to rely on professional and compassionate care for our loved ones when they are at their most vulnerable.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-01-22T20:56:18.1533333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-01-25T10:31:43.753","readBy":[{"name":"Swansea Bay University Health Board","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1020788","id":"1020788"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1020788/responses","id":"1020788"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1020788/healthservices","id":"1020788"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1020788/tags","id":"1020788"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/7a3c7","id":"7A3C7","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appalled","id":"appalled"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disappointed","id":"disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20upset","id":"very upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/failure","id":"failure"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/neglect","id":"neglect"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/negligence","id":"negligence"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nursing%20care","id":"nursing care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/loss%20of%20trust","id":"loss of trust"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lack%20of%20professionalism","id":"lack of professionalism"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lack%20of%20overall%20plan","id":"lack of overall plan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lack%20of%20coordination","id":"lack of coordination"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1022893","id":"1022893"}]},{"id":1020919,"author":"Erik12","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"I want to say unlimited thanks from all my heart.

It has always been my experience as a long time patient at this practice but more so in the past two years. This morning in particular I had such a lovely experience when I phoned the Escreet Grove surgery. I know I can’t name names but she will know who she is. The call was dealt with in a sympathetic, professional and caring way. The advice regarding making an Gp appointment going forward and actually getting another appointment booked with the nurse. The phone call to the surgery really solved my issues today.

Results again very speedy - consultant paged and appeared within 45 mins - proposed surgery, happened within 2 hours. All staff attentive, communications brilliant. Overnight stay with staff very visible, hands on and communicative. Slight delay before Physio appeared on Sunday but was well communicated by staff.  \r\nUnfortunately he then became unwell 3/4 days later - phoned NHS24 just after 6pm - had out of hours doctor appt at 7:30pm at RAH paisley - told to go to RHC glasgow - triaged within 1 hour and Ortho doc came about an hour later - slight delay in defining plan - but obs taken and cast removed - identified infection with full bloods then taken - results of high white blood count came back quickly, which initiated more tests and overnight stay required. A slight hiccup when pencillin administered very quickly - blood pressure and oxygen sats plummeted - doctors immediately appeared, assessed, monitored and reassured - made sure he was stable before moving on  \r\nAdmitted to ward 3C RHC (ortho) and again great experience - nurses were very busy ( full ward) but always had time to answer many questions, Doctors were brilliant, again always willing to answer questions communication between doctors, nurses, technicians, ultrasound, microbiology etc. could not be faulted - teamwork was brilliant !! For example, within 2 hours of doctor ward round - we had wheelchair technician appear, new brace appeared - all effortless ( from my viewpoint)  \r\nI felt I had to comment on such a positive, experience where all services obviously interacted so brilliantly. The doctors were brilliant, all so approachable, covered all bases medically with great communication skills (F1 doctor was brilliant with my son) Nurses were obviously very, very busy but always made time for us. At what could be a stressful time the staff made my son and I feel very well cared for by top notch professionals .

I enjoyed a very occasional drink, pre covid, however, knowing I would be driving to work everyday, I would only have a drink occasionally at weekends. I could take it or leave it.  \r\nDuring covid my drinking became more and more frequent. It was both a form of relaxation and escapism initially. But then one drink became two to a bottle of wine a few nights a week. I began struggling to get up for early morning teams meetings and when I did I couldn't think clearly and people would ask if I was OK, due to sounding coarse and croaky. My drinking became more and more frequent with larger amounts being consumed. It began affecting my work and family relationship.  \r\nMy emotions were all over the place and I felt lonely, low with a promise to myself almost every morning, that today was the day I would not have a drink and break the cycle.  \r\nOn really bad hangover days, it was easier to refrain, however, day two when the effects wore off, the craving around 4/5pm commenced. I'd feel guilty due to telling family I'd cut back and quit, but would then start again. I'd try to buy little bottles of wine and tell myself that's it, once it's gone, however, living very close to a shop made it easy to purchase more. I also began to drink in secret so my family weren't aware, but now realise, the only person I was really deceiving was myself.  \r\nThis had to stop. I referred myself to italk, not realising they don't support unhealthy alcohol related matters. They did however sign post me to local support groups, 1-2-1,and inclusion.  \r\nI began 1-2-1 meetings with inclusion which was embarrassing for me personally, that it had come to that, however, they were so friendly non judgemental and supportive, I actually looked forward to my meetings.  \r\nInclusion provided a multitude of areas to support me and my situation. They provided support for low self esteem and addictive behaviours, and to break cycles and build confidence.  \r\nIt hasn't been plain sailing, it's been hard at times, but I'm in a much better place, mentally and physically and not so hard or critical of myself. I've developed coping strategies, from meetings, courses and support. I've learnt to say no thank you, when in public places where colleagues push alcohol.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-01-23T13:56:08.12","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-01-25T13:24:31.98","readBy":[{"name":"Midlands Partnership NHS Foundation Trust","count":4},{"name":"Ulster University, MBBS (Medicine) 2021","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1020979","id":"1020979"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1020979/responses","id":"1020979"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1020979/healthservices","id":"1020979"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1020979/tags","id":"1020979"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rrex4-inclusion-hampshire-gosport","id":"RREX4-inclusion-hampshire-Gosport","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/embarrassed","id":"embarrassed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/alcohol","id":"alcohol"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bored","id":"bored"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/caring","id":"caring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/coping%20strategies","id":"Coping strategies"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/drinking","id":"drinking"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/flexibility","id":"flexibility"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/guilty","id":"guilty"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/knowledgeable","id":"knowledgeable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/listening","id":"listening"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lonely","id":"lonely"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/low","id":"low"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/non%20judgemental","id":"non judgemental"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/positive","id":"positive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professional","id":"professional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/understanding","id":"understanding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20supportive","id":"very supportive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%2019","id":"covid 19"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1022966","id":"1022966"}]},{"id":1021872,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Terrible service ","body":"Firstly, GPs at this surgery are fantastic, can't fault them. However receptionist staff are rude and intrusive. Every time I phone the surgery they want to know specifically what is wrong with you before they 'decide' you can have an appointment. What happened to patient confidentiality? I was particularly upset with the way I was treated when I took my daughter to surgery Jan 2023. I was told to put on a mask or I would not be able to see a doctor in surgery. No other patient in the waiting room had one on nor did any member of staff working behind the reception desk, which I have no problem with since covid is now something we have to live with. However, I felt singled out; my anxiety levels raised tenfold as I do not like confrontation but felt I had to question why me?? The enforcement of mask wearing in surgeries was dropped sometime in June 2022 so I'm not sure why they are continuing with this regimented way of practice. Because of this hostility, I have put off a cervical screening appointment which was due sept 2022. I have been online to make a formal complaint to the practice manager but there is no email option for this. Instead it invites you to speak to reception which is entirely the issue!!

Not so much anymore. Its very rare to get past the reception. When you do, great. But the issue with even just speaking with one seems to be getting worse. I tried on Monday as requested by the 111 doctor at the weekend. Who prescribed antibiotics for my chest, I've got emphysema.  I'm really rough, and was refused to speak with doctor. Told to wait till antibiotics have kicked in. We'll it's Wednesday now and I still feel ill. Can't breathe properly, I've increased my inhalers myself as I don't know what else to do, my voice has gone because of them I guess, Im coughing more but I don't want to call them again. I feel that rough but the thought of calling again for help and being biffed off by the receptionists depresses me. I've lost confidence in them. And after doing a recce of the local doctors no one is saying much better of any of the others. If you are not urgently sick (sick is sick surely) it's 3 weeks for an appointment , 2 weeks for a phone appointment. Seriously. What has happened to them since covid. Because that's when it all changed. And incidently, working in customer service myself, if you dobattend the surgery, I've seen personally, the receptionists finish their gossip before they turn to ask a patient how they can help. Really builds confidence. I'm looking for another doctor, unfortunately. I used to really feel happy here. Not anymore.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2023-01-25T05:39:29","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2023-01-25T14:30:23","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1021923","id":"1021923"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1021923/responses","id":"1021923"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1021923/healthservices","id":"1021923"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1021923/tags","id":"1021923"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/e83639","id":"E83639","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/antibiotics","id":"antibiotics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/better","id":"better"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/chest","id":"chest"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emphysema","id":"emphysema"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confidence","id":"confidence"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happy","id":"happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/worse%20than%20before","id":"worse than before"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/no%20confidence","id":"no confidence"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lost","id":"lost"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid","id":"covid"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20happy","id":"not happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20happy","id":"very happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%2019","id":"covid 19"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20great","id":"not great"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20ill","id":"very ill"}]},{"id":1021921,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Awful wait time","body":"i had a dislocated knee and damaged ligaments and they told me i had to wait 27 week’s ridiculous wait keeping me out of work and stopping me from being able to do anything","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2023-01-25T13:14:39","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-01-25T14:30:43","readBy":[{"name":"Northern Lincolnshire and Goole NHS Foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1021921","id":"1021921"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1021921/responses","id":"1021921"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1021921/healthservices","id":"1021921"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1021921/tags","id":"1021921"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rjl32","id":"RJL32","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dislocated","id":"dislocated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/knee","id":"knee"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1029229","id":"1029229"}]},{"id":1021050,"author":"kilowh68","authorRoleId":4,"authorRole":"a relative","title":"A fantastic team","body":"My mother was admitted to QEUH Ward 7d after a nasty chest infection. She was an impatient on the ward for 13 days and the care she received was exceptional, The staff could not do enough to help, every member of staff we encountered was fantastic.  \r\nThe first few days when she was undergoing tests the nurses would come in to reassure my mother and make sure she knew what was going on at all times and to ensure she wasn’t nervous. She was taken for a broncoscopy and I was allowed to go to the ward at 7:00 am to sit with her before the procedure. Every member of staff from the HCSW to the consultants were fantastic, and every nurse made time for my mother. I know how stretched these nurses are, and particularly respiratory during the winter, but it was never shown.  \r\nFantastic - I can’t thank them enough.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-01-23T15:59:04.7733333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-01-25T14:32:47.697","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":3}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1021050","id":"1021050"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1021050/responses","id":"1021050"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1021050/healthservices","id":"1021050"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1021050/tags","id":"1021050"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sj9qe-304","id":"sj9qe-304","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/all%20staff","id":"all staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bronchoscopy","id":"bronchoscopy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/chest","id":"chest"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/chest%20infection","id":"chest infection"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/consultant","id":"consultant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/exceptional%20care","id":"Exceptional care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fantastic%20staff","id":"fantastic staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/infection","id":"infection"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kept%20informed","id":"kept informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/respiratory","id":"respiratory"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support%20workers","id":"support workers"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tests","id":"tests"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fantastic%20team","id":"fantastic team"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20time","id":"given time"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1022982","id":"1022982"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1023675","id":"1023675"}]}]
