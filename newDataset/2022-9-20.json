Her behaviour and attitude reflects badly on this GP Surgery. She has somehow taken an instant dislike of me. I went in this morning (17th) and when she saw me she immediately turned her head away, said \"oh no,\" and whispered something to her colleague. I went to the window and after about 5 minutes of her ignoring me and staring into space, she reluctantly asked if she could help. My previous encounters with her had made me wary, so I told her, I would wait for the other Receptionist, who was on a phone call. She tried not to voice her displeasure or say anything inappropriate, but her body language, gestures and eye rolling let her down. I did not face her directly, but viewed her actions peripherally.  I dread going into the Surgery, in case she is on duty. Last week, I was actually standing by the window waiting and she called the man in the back of me. I objected and she sighed loudly and dealt with me first. She works in an environment where you have to be compassionate, empathic and sensitive when dealing with the public. I think she lacks people skills, which is blatantly evident. She needs more training in Customer care.

I called on Monday and asked for a visit, she asked me when I want and if the same day is suitable, I said that Tuesday is the best for me, she said that's great, I just need to call on Tuesday and they will give me an hour, I did so, but today I was told that the place is no longer available . (The conversation took place at 8:04 a.m.). When I said that I needed it as soon as possible because I no longer have the medicine that I take constantly, they found a place for me only on October 3rd.when I said that I was told to call the same day, she told me that there are no more places, I asked how come there are no more places in 4 minutes, she just tells me \"sorry\". This means I have to go private GP. I just don't understand why we pay for mandatory health insurance if services are not provided to me when they are vitally important to me? I wasn't even asked how long I've had the medicine for, or if it's been a long time since I've had it. Zero politeness, and I'm really considering moving my whole family to another one GP.  I just realized that the health of a person in GP means nothing. it's a pity that I had to choose this GP (to be more precise, I've never been to this GP, ) I wasn't even offered a doctor's consultation after re-appointment, even though they knew that I was constantly taking medication.

Reception can't find anything relating. Appointments ring 0830 explained I can't because in work.and we aren't aloud phones in work. Told nothing they can do as Drs say it has to be done this way. So because I work I get penalised by not having access to appointments. Shocking practice although receptionist have improved a bit.

I had 2 lots of prescriptions lost, was then told one of the prescriptions was at the chemist, went to the chemist and it wasn't there. Went back to the doctor's who told me to get the chemist to phone them as they would no longer issue any more prescriptions, they didn't even try looking for the other one and that was it she just glared at me until I moved away. The chemist looked at me as if I was crazy but finally did call the doctors and managed after half an hour to sort the problem out. I finally got my prescription, if it wasn't for the chemist I'd still be pulling my hair out after 2 weeks of trying to get hold of my original prescription. The chemist informed me that the one and only prescription sent were sent today just after I went back down to the doctors to complain that I couldn't get my prescription so they hadn't sent it in the 1st place. As a disabled widow on pensions who has to rely on her car this has cost me a fortune in petrol, time, energy and pain. Where is the doctor could have given me a written prescription as I had a face-to-face doctors appointment anyway today on the 5th of sept. But as they had already lost my written prescription that someone had printed off for me on Friday but I physically and financially could not afford to go back to the doctor's yet again to pick it up, it had to wait until Monday when I was going to the doctor's anyway so when I went to the reception desk they said that they couldn't find it so that was the 3rd prescription that they had actually lost. This has never happened to this degree but it does actually happen on almost a buy monthly basis, that they will either lose prescriptions, forget to issue prescriptions and they won't let me go back to a paperbase prescription that I can keep an eye on. They're saying that they just don't do that anymore but they definitely should cause it worked fine for me before.

And a doctor call back is a joke. I have been given a call back from a doctor (15min talk over the phone) after what I have been told that they need to see me but the doctor I was speaking to is going home so I will get another call back. I have been seen by paramedic with severe allergy reaction (email was sent to the gp) and my conditions were getting worse but in the emial it did not include a word urgent therefore as I have been told by the receptionist if I feel is that bad just go to a&e and don’t bother calling them. I will definitely change to a different GP. \nPlus noticed few times my kids conditions and doctor call backs were not noted on a system.\n","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-08-31T14:03:09","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2022-09-20T09:06:04","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/975156","id":"975156"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/975156/responses","id":"975156"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/975156/healthservices","id":"975156"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/975156/tags","id":"975156"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l81077","id":"L81077","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/allergy","id":"allergy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/worse%20than%20before","id":"worse than before"}]},{"id":974681,"author":"Niamhh1","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"more meal options","body":"The food is not great at all, I had problems with the food in Craigavon and it’s clear to see that there isn’t much difference here in lurgan.

I was again told slight shading in bowel but nothing to worry about.  \r\nI got a phonecall several months ago from a dietician who asked me how my chronic disease was affecting my day to day life and I said I don't have chronic disease, they went over all my personal details and confirmed I did indeed have chronic disease.  \r\nI spoke to my GP as my stomach was causing me to lose control of my bowels and I was having accidents.

I began feeling very vulnerable and unsure about everything, but she was very caring, patient and understanding, and helped me 'where I was at'. She went at my pace, gave me time and space while always being there, and never pushed me. She helped remind me of tools I already used in my life, and gave me some new and interesting perspectives or tools to try alongside that, which I found worked, and gave me options. She also just listened to me while I talked about what bothered me. I can't think of anything that could be better about the service based on my experience.
