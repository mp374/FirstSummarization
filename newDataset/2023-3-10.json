[{"id":1040189,"author":"Traditionalcanbegood","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"NHS staff attitude","body":"I had to take my wife to Aberdeen NHS Accident & Emergency department and arrived at about 12.50pm. After 3 hours of waiting I spoke to the reception staff asking about how long we may be expected to wait. The young staff member was cheery and said my Wife was next to be seen. I was pleased to hear this, commenting that it was a bit frustrating to see other patients arrive in A&E then be called to be seen by Doctor moments later and we had been waiting three hours.  \r\nIt was then that another staff member in this reception jumped into the conversation, commenting that this was because these patients had called the 111 helpline and made an appointment to be seen by a Doctor and this service was common knowledge and had been widely promoted in the press for the past three years. I was a taken back by this personal verbal assault and told them that I may seem old fashioned but the sign above the door said Accident and Emergency and that my first thought was not to call a NHS helpline to hear what I already knew, that my Wife needed medical help fast.  \r\nThis didn’t seem to phase them at all and I thanked the first staff member for their help and left. In this department there were constant announcements over the speakers that verbal abuse of any kind is not tolerated towards NHS staff (as it should be), yet there should be a notice that this works both ways. I am sure some may say the NHS are overworked and understaffed, but the attitude by this person was rude and vulgar, everything you don’t need in a time when stress levels are high to start with and stemming not from a complaint but a simple observation. Their comments were unnecessary, as was the smug attitude and I feel that this person should go on some patient empathy training, and after all that to find my Wife had been waiting three hours with a broken knee.  \r\nThe story does have a positive ending and shows the polar differences in staff and their attitudes, as the Doctor who helped my Wife was so thoughtful and thorough in their diagnosis and care, someone who the reception person could take a lesson from.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-03-09T23:58:39.9966667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-03-10T08:14:47.717","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Grampian","count":5},{"name":"ACVO TSI","count":2},{"name":"Aberdeen City Health & Social Care Partnership","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1040189","id":"1040189"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1040189/responses","id":"1040189"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1040189/healthservices","id":"1040189"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1040189/tags","id":"1040189"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/n101h_180","id":"N101H_180","score":3},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frustrated","id":"frustrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/a&e","id":"a&e"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/accident","id":"accident"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/courtesy","id":"courtesy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctor","id":"doctor"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency","id":"emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/empathy","id":"empathy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attitude","id":"staff attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting%20time","id":"waiting time"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1040471","id":"1040471"}]},{"id":1039545,"author":"MrsBura","authorRoleId":3,"authorRole":"a parent/guardian","title":"Such an invaluable resource","body":"We were really struggling with our baby who was refusing all solid food, it was very distressing to watch him become so emotional over us trying to encourage him to eat, we were deflated and upset at why he wasn't progressing with his eating.  \r\nOur health visitor referred us to the early years workers, and we met with Pauline.

I asked questions & I asked was it as painful as a colposcopy which I had 8 years ago and was painful! Was informed no pain as Local Anaesthetic (LA) will be given and mild painkillers is all you need.  \r\nI asked about sedation and was told I don’t need it and it’s not something they do, asked about gas & air was told yes 🙌 can have this, at this point I was informed about General Anaesthetic (GA) but after doctor explained that it’s not painful and managed with paracetamol I was made to feel foolish, asking for LA and happy with what I was told - mild pain.  \r\nExplained past history and previous Gynaecologist suggested always spray with LA Anaesthetic first with gas & air, reassured wouldn’t need it but was there if I felt I wanted it.  \r\nOn the day explained all my history and asked for gas & air, explained my back injury. Informed what was discussed with Gynae doctor & 8 years ago what was suggested. Doctor reassured me no pain or mild, they said yes you can have gas & air no problem.  \r\nBut during the hysteroscopy I was refused gas & air by the doctor, when shouting out in pain nurse tried to give me gas & air and doctor shout at them that it won’t make any difference.  \r\nDoctor did not explain what surgical tools they would be using or when they were about to do something (informed me afterwards). Was inappropriate about moving down the bed and made a joke about it. Was inappropriately laughing with nurse about boyfriends, not sure what the joke was but felt uncomfortable and unprofessional.  \r\nNo one in the room introduced themselves - didn’t get anyone's name, was told the doctor's name once in reception.  \r\nWasn’t listened to and didn’t consent to what was happening, being touched without being informed beforehand. Handled roughly when doctors moved me on the bed to give LA and then doctor left the area they were injecting stood over me and said do you want to cancel this. I said I just want pain relief or gas & air. They angrily said give me some (gas & air) also told me they'd given me extra LA.  \r\nDidn’t ask on a scale of 1-10 where your pain during the process  \r\nDidn’t ask if I was comfortable with my back issues  \r\nDidn’t care afterwards that I was in a lot of pain confused and in shock, shaking & high blood pressure  \r\nNurse on reception told me that I would not be in pain, mild discomfort, and I could have gas & air also she went and got the doctor to come in to reassure me I could have gas & air but this didn’t happen.  \r\nNurse informed me any tags or small fibroid would be removed today, never happened.  \r\nBiopsy was taken but no time scale given on results or where to get results - doctor verbally told me you do not have cancer & to be grateful for that, if they informed me I didn’t have cancer then why do a biopsy.  \r\nAsked why fibroid was not removed as the nurse had suggested , doctor told it’s like removing a house brick, not that easy. Why was this the medical term for explaining something to me? I understand anatomy and physiology & felt the doctor was being patronising and didn’t explain anything.  \r\nI was not helped out of the room or checked on while getting off the table, no extra support was given for my back. Despite me asking the nurses in the room, they watched me in distress & pain, one nurse tried their best to help but was told off. I asked two of the nurses why they didn’t they help, why don’t they give me gas & air, why did they allow me to suffer? (I was in too much shock to ask the doctor to stop). Nurse didn’t answer me just looked down and smiled sadly.  \r\nWith gas & air and LA I still felt excruciating pain and doctor said no you can’t have felt it, I gave you extra LA, I know pain and I felt pain.  \r\nI informed the nurse that checked me in that I was denied gas & air and wanted an explanation as to why, as I was confused with what they agreed to 20 mins ago didn’t happen, they did the opposite. The nurse asked the doctor and in my view the doctor lied with their reason.  \r\nPost op 1x A&E 3 x GP, ongoing trauma and back.  \r\nPain & stomach issues and time off from work.  \r\nThis doctor informed me I could go the gym & back to work the same day, they also advise that 90% of women feel no pain and the rest mild.  \r\nI felt threatened & scared, doctor standing over me looking angry 😡, I feel abused & misinformed  \r\nI’m not the only person, I have found a support group, I believe there are thousands of women who have the same experience, and it’s going unreported.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-03-09T18:55:06.8566667","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2023-03-10T09:55:04.867","readBy":[{"name":"Liverpool

Resource Centre, Glasgow initially in November 2021 and was a patient there till August 2022.  \r\nOn that appointment a psychiatric nurse came over straight into my face, making me lower my face mask and looking down my throat, insulting me by disbelieving what I said to him and taking advantage of my fragile mental state. He broke the Covid distance rules and entered, without my consent, into my private space, where I felt threatened and intimidated. He was there to do a psychiatric assessment, not abuse me and look down my throat. For a healthcare worker to do these things to a patient is diabolical.  \r\nAt that same appointment they did not listen to a word I said, made light of my problems and never took into the consideration the severity of my mental health, where I was extremely suicidal and wanted to kill myself. They asked irrelevant questions, were rude to me with judgemental outbursts, and did not allow me to talk in full about what I wanted to say.  \r\nThey also left me, a very suicidal person, to leave the premises without any contact details about anyone or anywhere, in case I needed to contact someone if I needed mental health support. They said I had Asperger’s syndrome, even though only ASD professionals can diagnose that.  \r\nWhen I finally got to speak to a psychiatrist, they phoned me fifteen minutes late and took only twenty minutes of what was meant to be an hour-long telephone consultation. I felt they did not take into account the fragile state of my mental health and my willingness to commit suicide. They did not provide the medication required nor strongly state the need for me to be on anti-depressants. I felt the psychiatrist did absolutely nothing to help me.  \r\nIn a year of dealing with them, I only got one 20-minute phone call and one half-hour webcam appointment. I felt they did not listen to a word I said, did not take into consideration the seriousness of my mental health and did not diagnose me with the problems I clearly have. I believe the professional I spoke to broke my confidentiality by putting our conversation on the NHS staff website. I have seen the records now and they are a distortion of what I said. I believe my problems were totally ignored, and I did not feel any empathy for the horrors I have endured in life. I need serious mental health support, but they did not provide this, did not help or diagnose my problems.  \r\nI have all the symptoms of schizophrenia and anyone can see that, but not them. I have no diagnosis and no treatment for this condition. I am left to suffer alone.  \r\nThen without my knowledge or consent I was removed from Arndale services and despite my doctor and myself trying to find another mental health service, I have been unable to get any necessary treatment or support for what is now over seven months because Arndale and HSCP are refusing to allow me to attend another mental health service anywhere in Glasgow or East Dunbartonshire. I therefore have been left to suffer with all my mental health problems for over seven months now without a proper diagnosis, support, treatment or any help whatsoever.  \r\nI have serious problems with my mental health and right now I have no mental health support whatsoever, from anyone or anywhere.

There’ve been a few referrals to other departments, but the advice for the GI issues - after antihistamines, low dose PPI and otc meds didn’t help - was to try a high dose PPI for around three months as this is what the gastroenterology department would do as a first treatment option given my child’s symptoms. If there was no improvement my child would then be referred to gastroenterology and would be seen quicker by them as there’s already been a first round of treatment.  \r\nMy child took the high dose PPI; GI symptoms got slightly worse during that time. A referral to gastroenterology was finally made.  \r\nMy child’s GI problems got worse after the referral was made and the general paediatrics consultant has been in touch by email and phone with a gastroenterology consultant on a number of occasions about the new symptoms and about getting an appointment for my child as the doctor was surprised that my child hadn’t been appointed yet.  \r\nThe general paediatric consultant has now left and I was advised to check with the gastroenterology department myself about an appointment (NHS appointment letters have been lost in the post before so I usually phone appointment booking or the departments directly if I’m waiting on appointments).  \r\nWhen I phoned gastroenterology earlier this week, I was told the waiting list for routine appointments is 30+ weeks, and if the symptoms have changed/worsened since the original referral then my child would need a new referral. This was all news to me!!! At no point was this ever mentioned to me before!  \r\nI explained a couple of times that the gastroenterology consultant knows about my child, but the secretary said that they emailed this consultant and the consultant told them that a new referral is needed. The secretary also told me that they can’t discuss any medical/clinical issues with me. I would have to go back to the GP (who hasn't been involved in my child's care since June 22) or general paediatrics.  \r\nI’m very upset about the lack of care and misinformation given by the gastroenterology department.  \r\nMy child’s new general paediatrics consultant has kindly given me a phone appointment next week to discuss the gastro issues/referral.  \r\nIn the meantime, my child is suffering from bad GI issues every single day and night…","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-03-09T11:07:02.78","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-03-10T10:22:48.15","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":5}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1039822","id":"1039822"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1039822/responses","id":"1039822"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1039822/healthservices","id":"1039822"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1039822/tags","id":"1039822"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sj9-children-gastroenterology","id":"sj9-children-gastroenterology","score":1},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/angry","id":"angry"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lack%20of%20care","id":"Lack of care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appointments","id":"appointments"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gastro","id":"gastro"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gi","id":"GI"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/referral","id":"referral"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting%20list","id":"waiting list"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1040413","id":"1040413"}]},{"id":1039848,"author":"Ail28","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"This is an excellent service","body":"Today I attended for removal and reinsertion of a Mirena coil and I would like to call out the staff for their excellent care.  \r\nI was welcomed and taken to the treatment room by a professional nurse, had a consultation where I was listened to and offered advice.  \r\nThe actual treatment itself was carried out by Dr Willocks and was over very quickly and pain free.

patient","title":"Fantastic labour experience well beyond anything I expected.","body":"After a rapid labour with my first child, I was hoping that the best case scenario for my second baby would be a stressful and chaotic but ultimately safe experience.  \r\nOn the night we rushed to hospital, the labour and delivery team were extremely busy, having just finished managing an emergency situation at the point we arrived.  \r\nIn spite of this, the standard of care we received was excellent from start to finish and allowed me to have a fantastic labour experience well beyond anything I expected.  \r\nI was initially met by Georgia at maternity assessment. She had a kind and reassuring manner which instantly put me at ease, and this is something I really valued as a someone who had struggled with anxiety throughout my pregnancy.  \r\nHannah was the midwife in charge of our care in the delivery room along with student, Rebecca. Due to my expectation of a rapid labour, I hadn't written a birth plan and hadn't given any thought to creating the right environment. I was purely focused on a safe delivery.  \r\nHannah could have given herself an easier shift after a stressful night by accepting this but instead, she took the time to discuss my choices for pain relief and was able to organise a water birth which I had never imagined would be possible due to the very short timescale we were working with. She even managed to bring a laptop in for us to have some music and this along with her expert guidance throughout the delivery allowed me to feel calm and in control during a very positive birthing experience.  \r\nAfter my son was born, we continued to receive excellent care from Emma and when we were transferred to the ward, my husband and I commented several times on how fantastic the team were who looked after us and our baby.  \r\nThe standard of care from the QEUH maternity team has been consistently high from every midwife, sonographer and doctor I have met in this department throughout my pregnancy despite the challenging work environment and pressures the team are facing each day.  \r\nI am very grateful to everyone who looked after us and played a role in bringing our baby boy into the world!

We were red flagged and seen quickly and the nurses were so reassuring and productive despite the pressures put on them.  \r\nThank you to the amazing nurses/Drs who looked after us on Castle Mey Ward- You’re doing such an amazing job and we are lucky to have you.  \r\nUnderstandably, no under 5s are allowed on the ward, but there’s an amazing space in outpatients on the ground floor that I was able to spend time with my 2-year-old whilst dad spent time with baby on the ward.  \r\nWe were also introduced to THE HUB, where they offer tea and coffee and there’s activities /singing etc for the kids and he was even able to choose a book to take home with him.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-03-09T11:23:18.6933333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-03-10T10:35:49.753","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lothian","count":8}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1039828","id":"1039828"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1039828/responses","id":"1039828"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1039828/healthservices","id":"1039828"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1039828/tags","id":"1039828"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/s225h_180","id":"S225H_180","score":5},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/s225h-cmward","id":"S225H-CMWard","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/a&e","id":"a&e"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breathing","id":"breathing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctors","id":"doctors"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fever","id":"fever"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/productive","id":"productive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting%20time","id":"waiting time"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/well%20cared%20for","id":"well cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassuring","id":"reassuring"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1041525","id":"1041525"}]},{"id":1039891,"author":"charlesfx23","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Excellent care in the hospital","body":"Respiratory and cardiology units at Forth Valley units are/were excellent in their care for me in last few months.&nbsp;","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-03-09T13:43:55.53","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-03-10T10:41:26.28","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Forth Valley","count":6},{"name":"Office of Michelle Thomson, MSP for Falkirk East","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1039891","id":"1039891"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1039891/responses","id":"1039891"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1039891/healthservices","id":"1039891"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1039891/tags","id":"1039891"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/forth-valley-royal-cardiology","id":"forth-valley-royal-cardiology","score":5},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/forth-valley-royal-respiratory","id":"forth-valley-royal-respiratory","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cardiology","id":"cardiology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/more%20beds","id":"More beds"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/respiratory","id":"respiratory"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20well%20looked%20after","id":"very well looked after"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1040387","id":"1040387"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1040720","id":"1040720"}]},{"id":1039842,"author":"papajt35","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Community Heart Failure Nurse","body":"Started using the service after heart failure diagnosed last April -

I ended up having quite a traumatic birth and was in theatre for an emergency forceps delivery.  \r\nI wanted to say a massive thank you to some members of the team that were involved in my care during the labour and recovery.  \r\nFirst, Senior Charge Midwife Sharon was absolutely lovely to me, my mum and my partner when we were in the labour suite, she was so patient and went out of her way to make me feel more comfortable even though the department was busy. She was so positive and reassuring and took the time to explain everything that was happening.  \r\nStudent midwife Jade was incredible with me as well, she was so professional and caring and made me feel so comfortable around her - she will make an amazing midwife.  \r\nI don't remember a lot from theatre but one of the members of staff that has stuck with me since the birth is John from the theatre team. Despite it being a stressful environment for me and my partner, he was by my side the whole time, constantly reassuring me and encouraging me to keep going. I can't thank him enough.  \r\nHealthcare support worker Hannah and student midwife Fiona from the infant breastfeeding team who came to see me after the labour were absolutely incredible. They spent a lot of time with me on the ward when I was struggling with breastfeeding, again just taking the time to explain things to me and reassure me makes such a difference. They were both so lovely, patient and knowledgeable and I am now home and breastfeeding successfully after thinking I wouldn't be able to, all with the help from them.  \r\nDespite it being a scary time for me and my partner and some slight downsides elsewhere in my care, the people I have mentioned above did make the experience more bearable.  \r\nSorry for the long feedback, I just really hope the positive comments get passed on to those that I've mentioned.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-03-09T13:34:39.1866667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-03-10T10:54:00.563","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Grampian","count":12},{"name":"Plymouth University, MSc Midwifery 2022","count":1},{"name":"ACVO TSI","count":1},{"name":"Aberdeen City Health & Social Care Partnership","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1039884","id":"1039884"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1039884/responses","id":"1039884"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1039884/healthservices","id":"1039884"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1039884/tags","id":"1039884"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/n161h_501","id":"N161H_501","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/birth","id":"birth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breastfeeding%20support","id":"Breastfeeding Support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/caring","id":"caring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/delivery","id":"delivery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/encouraging","id":"encouraging"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/forceps%20delivery","id":"Forceps delivery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/labour","id":"labour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/maternity","id":"maternity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/midwives","id":"midwives"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/patient","id":"patient"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professional","id":"professional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/well%20looked%20after","id":"well looked after"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassuring","id":"reassuring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/explanations","id":"explanations"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/comfortable","id":"comfortable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/theatre%20team","id":"theatre team"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/aberdeen","id":"aberdeen"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1071328","id":"1071328"}]},{"id":1039811,"author":"SEZZYD","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Having a polypectomy under general anaesthetic","body":"A scan picked up a polyp and I was invited to have a hysteroscopy without anaesthesia. I didn't read up too much about the procedure, just read the leaflet given to me.  \r\nWow, it proved intolerable painful. They couldn't even get properly through my cervix. They tried twice and then said it wasn't happening and offered me a general anesthetic.  \r\nWithin 12 days I was back in hospital in Day Surgery. I had the procedure and it's been relatively painless, no real bleeding and a fine fine team of doctors and nurses cared for me. However it's worth remembering that a GA has a profound affect on the body.  \r\nI felt pretty rough for 3 hours afterwards. I think my salivary glands stopped working and I needed anti-sickness meds. However if you find gynaecological investigations unpleasant and painful you can ask to have it done under GA.  \r\nIf you've got a polyp you must have it removed and it's only 18 hours after my op and I feel reasonably good.

As the days progressed, even the shyest of people gained confidence and engaged with others in a group setting.  \r\nI have made some really good friends who I will stay in contact with because they understand your journey.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-03-09T15:01:55.2233333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-03-10T12:15:35.793","readBy":[{"name":"Midlands Partnership NHS Foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1039937","id":"1039937"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1039937/responses","id":"1039937"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1039937/healthservices","id":"1039937"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1039937/tags","id":"1039937"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rrex4-inclusion-dcds","id":"RREX4-inclusion-dcds","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/alcohol","id":"alcohol"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/detox","id":"detox"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/humour","id":"humour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kind","id":"kind"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lucky","id":"lucky"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/meeting","id":"meeting"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/welcomed","id":"welcomed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confident","id":"confident"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported","id":"supported"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1041715","id":"1041715"}]},{"id":1039952,"author":"Nikita817","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Feel good about moving forward","body":"Had a really supported meeting about my reduction  \r\nI love Evie my support worker  \r\nCaroline was great with support and my reduction plan  \r\nDidn't feel rushed and feel good about moving forward","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-03-09T15:50:08.3233333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-03-10T12:18:52.123","readBy":[{"name":"Midlands Partnership NHS Foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1039952","id":"1039952"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1039952/responses","id":"1039952"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1039952/healthservices","id":"1039952"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1039952/tags","id":"1039952"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rrex4-buckinghamshire-aylesbury","id":"rrex4-buckinghamshire-aylesbury","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/alcohol","id":"alcohol"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/recovery","id":"recovery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support%20worker","id":"support worker"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported","id":"supported"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1040518","id":"1040518"}]},{"id":1038284,"author":"Marcia7","authorRoleId":1,"authorRole":"a carer","title":"Telephone triage appt system- very unsafe in mental health","body":"The GPs decided that all appointments, routine or urgent have to go through telephone system only.  \r\nNow, if you ring there is also a message saying the same and so when you have severe mental health symptoms where using the phone is unmanageable and triggers more symptoms, this is what you have to do. Or you don't get any GP appointment. Including when suicidal. Including where you might have hallucinations. Including when you might be in a very dark place.  \r\nMy close relative has very poor mental health, lives alone, doesn't have support workers or carers or a psychiatrist and there is no safe crisis care in mental health in this area. We all live out of London and cannot provide the care she needs and shouldn't have to be the link to a GP who has decided to cut off very vulnerable patients this way.  \r\nThe GP like all GPs has a register of all patients with severe mental illness and it's not as if they don't know her situation as many times she's been in hospital. She also has poor physical health that anyone without a severe mental health condition would get seen for but she can't now because her GP has cut her off this way.  \r\nWhat this phone only system does to her is this:  \r\nStops her being able to make any contact because she gets psychosis and now the GP refuses to let patients go in and make an appointment or email even when disabled or have poor mental health;  \r\nMakes harmful dangerous voices she hears even worse and more risky - which is why she doesn't have a phone in the first place;  \r\nTells her that she doesn't need help when symptoms are florid and she is unsafe because the GP isn't at all accessible;  \r\nTells her not to take medication because her not seeing a GP means no one monitors this;  \r\nTells her no point seeking help if and when her life is at risk. She has attempted suicide in the past.  \r\nClearly any GP knows full well that having a telephone only system stops very many being able to get a GP appointment but went ahead and did it anyway . Clearly looking on review sites they have been told and any GP worth their salt knows this - it is obvious and very basic healthcare to know the above if you are a busy London GP training practice.  \r\nHow can any GP think this is OK.  \r\nReally terrified something awful is going to happen to her and we get a knock at the door from police.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-03-06T19:58:01.1166667","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2023-03-10T12:20:00.62","readBy":[],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1038284","id":"1038284"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1038284/responses","id":"1038284"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1038284/healthservices","id":"1038284"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1038284/tags","id":"1038284"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/f83023","id":"F83023","score":1},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/crisis","id":"crisis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/terrified","id":"terrified"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/access%20to%20appointments","id":"access to appointments"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/alone","id":"alone"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appointments","id":"appointments"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20risk","id":"at risk"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disabled","id":"disabled"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disabled%20access","id":"disabled access"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/email","id":"email"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/empathy","id":"empathy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/link","id":"LINk"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20illness","id":"mental illness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/psychosis","id":"psychosis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/safe","id":"safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/suicidal","id":"suicidal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/suicide","id":"suicide"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/telephone","id":"telephone"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/triage","id":"triage"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/triggers","id":"triggers"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/basic%20needs","id":"basic needs"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unsafe","id":"unsafe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cut%20off","id":"cut off"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/no%20phone%20call","id":"no phone call"}]},{"id":1040409,"author":"warmfy49","authorRoleId":3,"authorRole":"a parent/guardian","title":"Thank you for giving us our daughter back","body":"When our teenage daughter attempted suicide we felt our world collapse.  \r\nWe felt heartbroken, helpless, hopeless and overwhelmed.  \r\nThe CAMHS Intensive Treatment Team (CITT) service were on board immediately on discharge.

They offered me Aberdeen or Glasgow waiting lists. I asked how the assessment process went and they explained I would be invited for an assessment, go home, then back another day for surgery. I then said I was not willing to travel to Glasgow on 2 separate occasions. They then said that they had not explained themselves correctly and said if I choose to go on the Glasgow waiting list I would be assessed and operated on the same day. They stated that the waiting list is much longer for Aberdeen than Glasgow  \r\nAfter that explanation, I agreed to go to Glasgow, but found out when my pre-assessment forms came through the post, that what I had been told was incorrect.  \r\nAlthough the accommodation provided in Glasgow was excellent, as was the care I received, had I been correctly informed, I would have saved myself time and stress, and just gone to Aberdeen. This process of outsourcing clinics is a good compromise, one I do support, but Grampian Health Board has picked up the tab for hotel accommodation and travel expenses which could have been avoided.  \r\nWhen I called Grampian Waiting List Clinic, after I received the pre-assessment forms and appointment date for Glasgow. I spoke with a lovely member of staff. When I explained my story (prior to going to Glasgow) they stated that this has been happening quite a lot.

He explained all the tests fully as we went along and I felt very comfortable throughout.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-03-09T10:23:51.0166667","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2023-03-10T12:34:57","readBy":[],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1039797","id":"1039797"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1039797/responses","id":"1039797"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1039797/healthservices","id":"1039797"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1039797/tags","id":"1039797"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/b120h-physiological-measurement","id":"b120h-physiological-measurement","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appointment","id":"appointment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cheery","id":"cheery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lovely","id":"lovely"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/outpatient","id":"outpatient"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/personable","id":"Personable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professionalism","id":"professionalism"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reception","id":"reception"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tests","id":"tests"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/person%20centred","id":"person centred"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/physiology","id":"Physiology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/full%20explanations","id":"full explanations"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/comfortable","id":"comfortable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/daunted","id":"daunted"}]},{"id":1040186,"author":"Smudger69","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Poor experience at Clinical Assessment Unit","body":"I was referred by GP to the above with serious sepsis due to an infection and was told that I would be put on IV antibiotics when I get there.

I was still feeling unwell and went to my GP today, they asked if I got IV antibiotics to which I said no. I was also told that my inflammatory markers were over 100 when they should be between 0-5 and my ecg heart rate was high.

The receptionist was helpful and friendly.  \r\nUnderstandably, the department was very busy but the triage nurse got to Toddler within a half hour of our appointment time. It took about 45 minutes to then to see the doctor, who checked from elbow to the tips of Toddler's fingers for injuries. She was friendly and kind to Toddler, who was a little unsure and afraid of the unfamiliar examination room. Thankfully there were no breaks or fractures, but the doctor advised taping Toddler's pinky and ring fingers to protect the injured pinky. A nurse demonstrated and walked me through taping the fingers then provided us with the tape and guaze we would need for the next few days.Fantastic staff taking care of our kids, and doing so in a short time frame. Our short wait time was due to a number of higher priority injuries presenting around the same time that we arrived and we were comfortable enough in the waiting room surrounded by toys, a colouring station and kids TV shows.Toddler left with taped fingers, a smile and a monkey teddy.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-03-10T00:09:59.11","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-03-10T14:10:31","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lothian","count":9}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1040190","id":"1040190"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1040190/responses","id":"1040190"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1040190/healthservices","id":"1040190"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1040190/tags","id":"1040190"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/s225h_180","id":"S225H_180","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bruises","id":"bruises"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/concerned","id":"concerned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fast","id":"fast"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fell","id":"fell"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/finger","id":"finger"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helpful","id":"helpful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/in%20pain","id":"in pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/minor%20injuries","id":"minor injuries"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wonderful%20staff","id":"wonderful staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/relieved%20now","id":"relieved now"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/injuries","id":"injuries"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1041521","id":"1041521"}]},{"id":1040021,"author":"circinusrp67","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Very helpful and supportive","body":"Health visitor Jane has been very helpful and supportive and although (almost) everyone has a negative story about a health visitor, so far this hasn’t been the case with me!","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-03-09T19:03:38.5566667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-03-10T14:10:44.33","readBy":[{"name":"Northern Health and Social Care Trust","count":6}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1040021","id":"1040021"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1040021/responses","id":"1040021"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1040021/healthservices","id":"1040021"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1040021/tags","id":"1040021"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt002-healthvisiting","id":"zt002-healthvisiting","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/advice","id":"advice"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helped","id":"helped"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helpful","id":"helpful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/informed","id":"informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/me","id":"ME"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported","id":"supported"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1042885","id":"1042885"}]},{"id":1040005,"author":"Caz87","authorRoleId":4,"authorRole":"a relative","title":"The care was 10/10","body":"Today I brought my 80 year old grandad in as he’d fallen at the home he lives in and they were worried he’d hurt his arm.

I Just wanted to leave a review and recognise the care was 10/10 and would like to thank each staff member who was involved in grandads care today.  \r\nBig thanks to all at the frailty team 🙌🏻🙌🏻","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-03-09T17:38:04.4133333","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2023-03-10T14:13:21.6","readBy":[],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1040005","id":"1040005"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1040005/responses","id":"1040005"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1040005/healthservices","id":"1040005"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1040005/tags","id":"1040005"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rwwwh_430","id":"RWWWH_430","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing%20staff","id":"amazing staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/arm","id":"arm"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/assessment","id":"assessment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bloods","id":"bloods"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dementia","id":"dementia"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dementia%20awareness","id":"dementia awareness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ecg","id":"ecg"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/welcoming","id":"welcoming"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/xray","id":"Xray"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/patience","id":"patience"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/relaxed","id":"relaxed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20ease","id":"at ease"}]},{"id":1039900,"author":"MisterC","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Physio to injured shoulder","body":"My shoulder and arm had been very painful for about 3 years from unknown causes.

The doctor diagnosed a rotator cuff injury and referred me to X-ray and was given a shoulder steroid which helped. Came off the tablet steroids and took tramadol instead.  \r\nWas referred to physio. At Lockerbie I was seen by Sinead who examined me, and after diagnosis gave me some tension exercises which gradually, over 4 months, relieved the pain and helped strengthen the muscles so I can use my right arm again.

They all put us at ease, explained everything, gave an opportunity for questions and listened to what we had to say.  \r\nWe were there for a number of hours and heard lots of people moaning about the waiting, but the staff were very good throughout our journey of explaining where there might be a wait - I think if you expect it, it is always easier to deal with. Given the treatment we received I think that waiting a little is a small price to pay.  \r\nTo be so thoroughly checked out, we do have an amazing NHS when it works well, and I felt it worked really well yesterday. It was clearly a department that worked really well together, like a well oiled machine! We were so grateful for the service we received. Thanks to a great team.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-03-10T09:10:19.3466667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-03-10T15:10:10.023","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":4}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1040350","id":"1040350"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1040350/responses","id":"1040350"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1040350/healthservices","id":"1040350"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1040350/tags","id":"1040350"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/g107h-aau","id":"G107h-aau","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/aau","id":"aau"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ct%20scan","id":"CT scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/explanation","id":"explanation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helpful","id":"helpful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/infection","id":"infection"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/level%20of%20care","id":"level of care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sinus","id":"sinus"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20at%20ease","id":"put at ease"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/listened%20to","id":"listened to"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1042857","id":"1042857"}]},{"id":1040370,"author":"Sala13","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Incredibly supportive and a very good listener","body":"In September last year I was offered the opportunity to have a referral to the well-being service from my GP. I was desperate to stop smoking due to several health issues that were being made worse by it, and I had made several unsuccessful attempts in the past. The referral was picked up quickly and before I knew it I had been sent information through the post and had an initial meeting with my advisor Lorna.  \r\nFrom the outset she was incredibly supportive and a very good listener, we talked through all of the issues I'd had in the past, and put together a plan for how we were going to tackle it and what could possibly help or hinder my progress. She covered every angle and always addressed tasks that needed doing in a timely manner, for example liaising with my GP to arrange prescriptions.  \r\nUnfortunately during the time we were working through the plan I experienced a significant period of high stress. This was all going on alongside having just moved to the area. It was not an easy time and Lorna was so very kind and compassionate towards me and my family, even though I had a small relapse she was never judgemental, she listened with empathy and kept me accountable for my actions without pushing me too hard. I was able to start again and continue on the plan we had agreed.  \r\nWe had regular telephone meetings. During each of our meetings we discussed different things that were working for me and events that might cause me problems and we came up with a plan. Lorna is full of creative ideas and has a wealth of knowledge about all sorts of things. She directed me to podcasts, websites, exercise classes the list goes on.  \r\nI have just been discharged from the service- I'm currently 128 days clear of smoking. I never thought I could achieve this, and I will never go backwards. (the NHS app keeps me accountable daily).  \r\nI have seen a significant improvement in my health issues and there is no way I could have reached this point without the help of my advisor Lorna, and I will always be grateful to her and the Well-being service for that, as well as my GP for the initial referral.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-03-10T09:55:16.5766667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-03-10T15:22:09.65","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Borders","count":4}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1040370","id":"1040370"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1040370/responses","id":"1040370"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1040370/healthservices","id":"1040370"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1040370/tags","id":"1040370"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sb9-borders-quit-your-way","id":"SB9-borders-quit-your-way","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/knowledgeable","id":"knowledgeable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/non%20judgemental","id":"non judgemental"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/partnership","id":"partnership"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/person-centred","id":"person-centred"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/smoking","id":"smoking"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/smoking%20cessation","id":"smoking cessation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassionate","id":"compassionate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good%20listener","id":"good listener"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/evidence%20based%20practice","id":"evidence based practice"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/timely%20support","id":"Timely support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/well%20supported","id":"well supported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/listened%20to","id":"listened to"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1040485","id":"1040485"}]},{"id":1040478,"author":"intensityse86","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Very professional and reassuring","body":"I attended ARI outpatient ultrasound.
