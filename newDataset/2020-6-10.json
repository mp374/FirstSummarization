Was seen straight away in the RAT by a lovely student nurse and EDA. The nurse did a bladder scan and then the battery died. Then once the battery had been replaced the machine couldn't find any urine in my bladder (This was a brand new £5000 piece of equipment). Next, the EDA came to do an ECG, all was going well and then they came back and told me the machine was faulty and was showing abnormalities on the ECG so would had to redo it.  \r\nNo medical problems actually occurred up until then.  \r\nThen I was transferred to 'ED 2' - the trusts poor method of separating potential COVID patients and non-COVID patients. In this area (which is where the OOH GP used to be located) there is 8 chairs and a few separated rooms. Of which some of the trolleys don't fit through the door and of which some rooms don't have suctioning. So if a patient was in cardiac arrest then they wouldn't fit through the door into a room.  \r\nWhen the doctor finally saw me they were nothing but obnoxious, the first thing said to me was accusing me of attending too often, and then took a very poor history. All they asked was how much had I drank today, and then told me to get on the bed and pressed on my stomach. They never asked about any family history of renal problems such as the fact half my family have polycystic kidney disease !  \r\nThis Dr then said the nurse would come and take some blood, and I would need to drink loads of water  \r\nNext the nurse came and told me to get on the bed while they took the blood sample, so I said that they have to take it from my hand. Then they asked whether I wanted them to tell me they're doing It or just do it. So I explained that its probably best telling me in case I hit them by accident. They then said I'd better not hit them, and got up and left and then said really loudly to the doctor that I said I would hit the nurse if they tried to take my blood... but not on purpose.  \r\nThe the doctor came in and kept telling me they needed the blood and without it wouldn't be able to treat me and would have to stick a tube up to get the urine out. They then asked me why I wouldn't let them or the EDA. take the blood, I explained this wasn't coming across as very caring or competent, and they kept trying to coerce me into letting them take the sample. I then said that I didn't want this person to treat me and that I wanted a different doctor to which they just stood there still trying to get me to give a sample. So I finally just put up with the pain and let them take the sample .  \r\nAt no point during this whole time I was in A&E was I offered any sort of painkillers so I had to sit there for 3 - 3 1/2 hours in pain.  \r\nRang the A&E department to speak to nurse in charge who said the doctor was called and what the EDA was called. Was given the doctor's name but the EDA was unknown because it wasn't recorded. Have spoken to the GMC who said either this isn't the doctors name or they aren't a registered medical practitioner.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-06-07T13:20:02.5266667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-06-10T10:48:25.893","readBy":[{"name":"Blackpool Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/771474","id":"771474"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/771474/responses","id":"771474"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/771474/healthservices","id":"771474"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/771474/tags","id":"771474"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rxl01_180","id":"RXL01_180","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/annoyed","id":"annoyed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/abdominal","id":"abdominal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/assessment","id":"assessment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bladder","id":"bladder"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20test","id":"blood test"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctor","id":"doctor"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ecg","id":"ecg"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ed","id":"ed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/equipment","id":"equipment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/in%20pain","id":"in pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kidney","id":"kidney"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lovely","id":"lovely"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nursing%20care","id":"nursing care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/renal","id":"renal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scan","id":"scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attitude","id":"staff attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wait%20time","id":"wait time"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/spoken%20over","id":"spoken over"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/774483","id":"774483"}]},{"id":771841,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Bad experience with CMHRS","body":"I was reffered by A and E and I feel that they had no intention of helping me.

I was very unsure how this was going to go we spoke a lot about my trauma and he suggested EMDR Eye movement Desensitisation and Reprocessing .This started 14 weeks ago and with the help support and dedication of my therapist i have come through I have been taught so much by him and how to process things also he has given me the confidence that i so lacked. None of this would have been possible without this service I cannot thank this service enough. I hate to think of where i would be.Anyone who reads this and has any doubt i would say take the plunge even in the group therapies where i must admit i spent most of the time crying you realise you are NOT on your own and thats the first major hurdle to get over.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-06-08T14:55:56.1733333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-06-10T13:04:04.257","readBy":[{"name":"Midlands Partnership NHS Foundation Trust","count":6},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2020)","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/771606","id":"771606"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/771606/responses","id":"771606"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/771606/healthservices","id":"771606"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/771606/tags","id":"771606"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rrex4-inclusion-thurrock","id":"rrex4-inclusion-thurrock","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/abuse","id":"abuse"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dedication","id":"dedication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/desensitisation","id":"desensitisation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emdr","id":"emdr"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/group%20therapy","id":"group therapy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/help","id":"help"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/therapist","id":"therapist"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confidence","id":"confidence"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/educational","id":"Educational"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/786239","id":"786239"}]},{"id":769774,"author":"ab313","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Poor Care","body":"I have found the Staff at Avenue House are very rude and unprofessional.

Mr Mukherjee and his team were first class in explaining the issues and the plans and of course the risk . Mr Mukherjee was honest and helped us to understand everything that was going on . A special mention for attentive and understanding should be given to Staff Nurse Kimberly who looked after us and got us access to see Gerard before the Operation.  \r\nGerard was transferred to ACCU post operations and was very unwell. The team at that point lead by Dr Lucie were again highly attentive and again very communicative and clarified the seriousness of the situation. In Gerard’s more immediate care his named Nurse Ashley / Ashleigh was brilliant, caring, compassionate and so professional when Gerard came from Post Op. Gerard’s one to one nurse on the night shift was Michelle and it was during this point that Gerard deteriorated again Michelle and Dr Lucie were the ultimate in their caring professionalism . Gerard was able to pass away with dignity and his Final Orders again were completed with such understanding and appropriateness.  \r\nWe would like to thank all of the teams who looked after Gerard in what was unusual circumstances due to Covid 19 and they offered us every kindness and respect.  \r\nThe Whole Family","criticality":"minimally critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-06-09T11:09:56.9333333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-06-10T14:32:49.71","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lanarkshire","count":7},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":2},{"name":"South Lanarkshire Health and Social Care Forum","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/771695","id":"771695"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/771695/responses","id":"771695"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/771695/healthservices","id":"771695"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/771695/tags","id":"771695"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l308h_100","id":"L308H_100","score":4},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/attentive","id":"attentive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/caring","id":"caring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/honest","id":"honest"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kindness","id":"kindness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/looked%20after","id":"looked after"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurse","id":"nurse"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/operation","id":"operation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professionalism","id":"professionalism"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/respect","id":"respect"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/understanding","id":"understanding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/well%20looked%20after","id":"well looked after"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassionate","id":"compassionate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dignity","id":"Dignity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/contactable","id":"contactable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/explanations","id":"explanations"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/incorrect%20named%20on%20email%20death%20certificate","id":"incorrect named on email death certificate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/inaccurate%20death%20certificate","id":"inaccurate death certificate"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/771873","id":"771873"}]},{"id":771703,"author":"Noimagination","authorRoleId":4,"authorRole":"a relative","title":"Lack of visitors","body":"What has QUEH done to compensate for the lack of visitors over the last 11 weeks (especially for long term patients)  \r\nMy perception as a relative of a long term patient is is not a lot. iPads have been put on wards with no training or system for use.

As my family are shielding I had to go to A and E alone. I was advised to go to A and E by 111 at about 3pm with severe abdominal pain and I vomited in the waiting area Almost as soon as I arrived. I waited in tears and in agony but was unable to be helped. Social distancing was not possible in many areas. A few hours later I was moved into a busier area and finally spoke to a nurse. My notes had not been recorded but I was told I would be given pain relief and sent out to the cramped waiting room again. I was left for another 30 minutes before being given pain relief by mouth in the waiting area. I then vomited and collapsed on the floor. I was then moved to a bed and given a drip for my pain relief but the pain was still bad. I was then moved to a quieter area for a scan but the pain was still terrible - about another hour later. Nurses realised my drip was not working and replaced it. Still the pain was bad so I was given another suppository pain relief to help. At 9pm I was told I couldn’t have a scan so I would need to go home and would be called for a scan in the morning and was given pain relief tablets for home. I did not get the call the next day so my husband called and eventually got me a scan appointment as I was in such agony despite pain relief. The scan was done and about an hour later I was sent to Canterbury Hospital to undergo emergency surgery. If I had been sent directly to Canterbury I don’t think I would have had to endure the trauma and pain that I experienced at Ashford. More information is needed about which A and E department to attend - I was given no advice by 111 as they were based in Norfolk. Canterbury is only minor injuries now but I understand now could have been able to deal with my symptoms more successfully than Ashford but I was unaware. The situation at William Harvey is unacceptable at any time but  in the current Covid 19 crisis is wrong and urgent action needs to be taken.

I am not allowed to visit due to Covid 19 situation.  Communication with the Wards has been really difficult - phone ringing with no one picking up, phone call being disconnected by Ward, being given the wrong extension numbers etc.  I know they are busy but there has always been communication issues with this hospital.  All I want to do is ask if staff can send dirty clothes down to Reception so I can collect them when I bring in fresh ones.

Five years later and after being in a serious car crash and having both knees replaced I still carried on using methadone for pain relief. When the time came to stop methadone I was given the choice to reduce with my GP’s support or to be referred to CGL. After lots of reassurances about CGL being more knowledgeable and offering groups etc I decided to give CGL a try. I work full time as a safeguarding midwife and asked if I could have monthly pick up of my medication as I work all over the country. This was not acceptable but I was allowed to pick it up weekly. \nWith the Covid19 I was doing shifts all\nover the place and had to isolate\nwith new parents whose child was on the “at risk” register. I had to take one new born to a foster placement in Bristol and was asked to leave on the Sunday night ready to meet the foster carer and social worker on Monday and to return on the Wednesday. I collected all of the court paperwork and emails etc to confirm the process. I messaged my key worker as my\nWeekly script was starting on the Monday and I asked if I could collect my\nScript the day before or could i just take one Or two daily dose with me for the Monday and if needed for the Tuesday, I explained to my key worker that I had no choice but to go as I was the only\nqualified person to go and speak in court in regards to the possibility of the parents being given a chance to go to an assessment unit to see if they could parent the child. \nAfter providing all the evidence to my key\nWorker I was not allowed to take one dose with me for the Monday. I was not sure how i would feel after missing a dose\nand if the court case carried on to the next\nday it would therefore be 2 day’s without my meds and as I was giving evidence as a person qualified to give my opinion on the care of the child. \nI asked my employer if I could send another nurse to take my place but I had a reply stating that My contract states my availability to be on call when required and to be able to travel at short notice. I was told that if i didn’t go I would be given a written warning. Yet again I showed my Key Worker all of my correspondence with my employer but I was told that I would have to risk being without my meds for 1 or maybe 2 days as she would not authorise for me to pick up a dose to take with me. \nI am so disappointed at the lack of empathy and the way my key worker appeared to take great delight in saying that I had to either lose my job or lose up\nto two doses of my medication. \nSince this time I have had another issue with my pick up date being changed without my knowledge. I will write this incident on a separate review. \nThank you ","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-06-10T16:08:57","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-06-10T19:50:20","readBy":[{"name":"Change Grow Live","count":6}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/771902","id":"771902"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/771902/responses","id":"771902"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/771902/healthservices","id":"771902"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/771902/tags","id":"771902"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/nms","id":"NMS","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disappointed","id":"disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/crash","id":"crash"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/methadone","id":"methadone"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/morphine","id":"morphine"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain%20relief","id":"pain relief"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/safeguarding","id":"safeguarding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/shingles","id":"shingles"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20disappointed","id":"very disappointed"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/772811","id":"772811"}]},{"id":771903,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Fantastic service ","body":"I was really impressed with the thorough COVID19 procedures and felt very safe and reassured.

Doctor thought that this may be due to blood pressure tablets, but then did some measurements and decided to take blood samples which she did there and then. This was at 9.30am, at 4.30pm I had a phone call from the doctor ssaying that they had found evidence of DVT in my left leg. The doctor immediately sent a prescription to my pharmacy and asked me to check that they had them in stock. Also told me that an appointent was booked for Monday at 2pm at Epsom Hospital for a scan on my leg. I attended the scan and was given the results straight away. Yes, I have blood clots in my lower left leg, I am continuing the tablets for the next 3 weeks, then a lower dose for 4 weeks and have today received a follow up appointment for 20th July (to see if the tablets have dissolved the clots). They are also going to do a full body CT scan to check there are no problems elsewhere.\nI can only say a HUGE thank you to the doctor who didn't just let it go that it was the blood pressure tablets causing the swelling but thought it through that I had been taking those tablets for several years why would they affect me like this now. \nObviously I am still very early into the treatment, but if it wasn't for my GP the outcome could be so very different as it wouldn't have been treated at all.\nAll I can say is THANK YOU for your dedication and perception it is truly appreciated.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-06-10T17:55:56","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-06-10T19:56:52","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/771908","id":"771908"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/771908/responses","id":"771908"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/771908/healthservices","id":"771908"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/771908/tags","id":"771908"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/h81080","id":"H81080","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ankle","id":"ankle"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/antibiotics","id":"antibiotics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood","id":"blood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20pressure","id":"blood pressure"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ct","id":"ct"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ct%20scan","id":"CT scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dvt","id":"dvt"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/infection","id":"infection"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/leg","id":"leg"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pharmacy","id":"Pharmacy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scan","id":"scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appreciated","id":"appreciated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/846874","id":"846874"}]},{"id":771907,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Initial Contact & Process Management ","body":"There are some good doctors at the practice who are experienced, competent, thorough and listen to what you are saying. It’s an entirely different experience navigating the frontline. I feel as if I’m preparing to go into battle each time. Sometimes you hit lucky and get someone who is helpful. Often not. I have shed tears of frustration on more than one occasion after the call. I avoid phoning and will email/use ereception  where possible. When I received a text with a link to complete my annual review, I replied to the text with some queries. I have 2 of the conditions listed and the application would only let you select one. I also wanted to know whether the spirometry test included in the review would be picked up at a later date. When I received no response, I emailed the practice - first on 28/04, then chased on 05/05 & 13/05. I’m still waiting for any response - even one saying this email address is currently not being monitored.

He was then transferred to ward 110, I phone to see how he is and for an update to be told that the nurse looking after him would come to the phone. I am put on hold. I get a ringing tone which goes on for 8/9 mins and then cut off. I phone back and the phones rings for 5mins no answer, then I ring again this time it rings for 6mins the again I phone and it rings for another 5/6 mins. Finally on ringing again I get a brief answer I explain whats happened and get told we in middle of handover call again in around a half hour or so.  \r\nI know nurses are very busy and they do a great job especially now, but now is a very worry time for next of kin when their loved one is admitted and they are alone and you cannot be with them. All I need to know is that he is settled and ok. Maybe instead of that brief answer It may have been nice to say sorry we in hand over I know you worried I will get his nurse to call you afterwards. It took so long to get through to get the response I did. Maybe I am over sensitive but he is under shielding, over 70, diabetic and has cancer.

I was given the opportunity in court to join the family drugs and alcohol court (fdac) I didn't want to stop using it was the only way I new how to cope but I wanted my kids back so I signed up. I was under so much stress trying to say what I thought people wanted to hear, act and look like I was clean and arrange my sons funeral 6m after he died due to complications there was delays, this left me exhausted and run down and I'd started to have enough I didn't want to continue.  \r\nI didn't want to use at my sons funeral so I did my first day without using, then several and managed to be clean to say goodbye (still being watched by social, schools and what felt like everyone). A few days later I fell ill with what I thought was the flu, doctors thought appendix, by time I got to a and e I just collapsed I woke up in resus with them trying to find veins, my body shutting down from sepsis, my ex partner on phone asking why in hospital ( no one new I was there) no contact with kids, no parents feeling all alone. I spent just over a week in hospital and as soon has I got out (still week) I used. Something had changed and It wasn't the same, I didn't want to do this anymore so why could I not stop?  \r\nThis is the first time I got honest with workers and said I can't stop, I began to listen and try new things, change who I hung around with and to be honest with how I was feeling, I couldn't ignore what was going on in my life. I had court for kids, court for driving under influence, court for child neglect. I was fighting my ex after he raped me and dealing with grief and my extremely poor mental health. I really started to try and over Christmas when everything had shut down I attended my first fellowship meeting because I did not want to use on what would of been my sons 1st birthday but new I couldn't do it alone, this was the first time I had met so many people that got my obsessions to use, my selfish behaviours and could identify with where I was at, the first time I saw hope if they can change then so could I.  \r\nI got days, months I managed life events clean I never thought was possible (anniversary, crown Court) I attended my drugs key workers every 2-3 days for tests (swabs) I wanted to prove I was clean, hair strand tests I was creating new friends, positive changes and increased contact. I started to change I started to understand the difference between love and parenting I always loved my kids justifying my using with they go school, fed roof over head but I wasn't there presently I wasn't there emotionally.  \r\nI gained knowledge and skills I went on courses and continued to work on myself. A year and 4m after the children where removed from my care they started to rehabilitate my children back here with one night, weekends until they where all back in my care. This was difficult they had a routine I had to adapt to and knowing I had so much to prove to them, to me but to everyone watching. My kids where on a interim care order for over a year I had to fight to get it reduced to supervision order mainly due to my eldest daughter having behaviour difficulties and issues outside the household but I felt my past was constantly used against me.  \r\nBy this point I had started volunteering first for a mental health campaign it takes balls to talk, the recovery partnership in the needle exchange and winter night shelter, I learnt early in recovery I only keep what I have by giving it away, like those who helped me and showed me the way early in my recovery. I loved working with people and went on to work with cgl (change grow live) and becoming a director of a organisation I helped establish to help those who are rough sleeping or have complex needs, we work with organisations to break down the barriers to services are sit has experts by experience for the local authority. We have won awards as the arc and I also won the health and wellbeing award for the volunteer work with cgl.  \r\nToday I still work with social services around my daughters needs (rather then against them) my children have a upbringing where I am the best parent I can be(present not perfect) am still clean and in recovery, still working on myself has this is still new compared to the life I spent using. I still have to deal with life on life's terms and the challenges that brings but today I'm content with life.

It was my 4th baby and 2nd caesarean. The birth went well, I couldn’t fault the staff in theatre and recovery, they made me feel at ease and were lovely and supportive throughout.  \r\nI then got transferred to Wheal Fortune ward for postnatal care. Within a couple of hours of being on the ward I was in quite a lot of pain. I asked the midwife looking after me for more analgesia and was given paracetamol. Throughout my stay on the ward anything stronger than paracetamol or ibuprofen was greatly discouraged and I was made to feel awful for asking for anything else. I was told that I would pass the drug to my baby through my breast milk and that it would have a detrimental effect on her. Needless to say I had a very uncomfortable and difficult night.  \r\nThe next morning my baby was found to have a heart murmur and we were ushered up to Neonatal for an echocardiogram. I walked to the lifts and then on to the examination room with nothing more than paracetamol cover less than 24 hours after major abdominal surgery. Once there I had to be given a chair and a drink, I thought I was going to pass out with the pain. When I eventually arrived back at the ward, I asked for more pain relief and was told that I wasn’t due any paracetamol yet. I burst into tears and was thankfully given dihydrocodeine to settle the pain.  \r\nThe doctor that spoke to me before my discharge a few hours later asked how my pain was and I told him that it had been almost unbearable due to a lack of pain relief. He seemed shocked that I hadn’t been given stronger analgesia regularly. I was in an incredible amount of pain in those first 24 hours and whilst I understand the risks of dihydrocodeine when nursing, I feel I should have been allowed to make an informed choice about whether to take it or not; I think it’s wrong that I was made to feel so bad about needing it and almost too afraid to ask for it.  \r\nMy baby was given an orange hat to wear immediately after birth which represented a need for support. It was explained to me that this need was due to me having had a c-section and wanting to breastfeed when I had been unable to feed my other children for various reasons. I was assured by my community midwife prior to the birth that the staff on the postnatal ward would support me with nursing my daughter and so I was pleased when she was given this hat as it meant that they would have a visual aid to make them aware of my need for help.  \r\nHowever, not one member of staff throughout my stay on the ward asked if I needed help, if I knew what I was doing or if I needed information about positioning, latching, feeding cues or frequency of feeding etc. I was left to get on with it completely on my own. I rang the bell several times during my stay to ask for assistance but the staff always took so long to respond that I would try to get my baby feeding on my own. When they did arrive I would ask if my baby was latched correctly and each time the midwife or MSW that came had a quick look, said yes and then swiftly left. All apart from one midwife who proceeded to manhandle my baby away from my breast without any warning. She shoved her under my gown and said ‘she needs more skin-to-skin time’ and then she left. My husband and I were both quite shocked that she would grab our baby in this manner without gaining consent or even explaining what she was about to do.  \r\nNo further advice was given so after a period of skin-to-skin I just struggled on with the next feed, no further forward in knowing what I was doing. I didn’t know how to latch a baby on to the breast and didn’t feel like I was doing it right at all but no one listened to my concerns or offered any help. When I was discharged the next day, I left the hospital feeling very sore and disappointed in the lack of support I had received.  \r\nNot all of the staff but certainly the majority seemed to show a ‘no-nonsense attitude’ and when you’re in pain and feeling vulnerable after just having had a baby, this can come across as abrupt and really quite aggressive. My catheter hadn’t been draining well overnight and the midwife was monitoring it. She encouraged me to drink plenty of fluids which I made sure I did. However, in the morning when the MSW came to work out my fluid balance she took one look at the catheter bag and then told me off for not drinking enough. I told her about the numerous jugs of water I’d had to drink and that the midwife was aware of the situation but she continued to speak to me very rudely, practically saying that I was lying about the drinks I’d had. As a medical professional myself, I know the importance of fluid intake to decrease the risk of blockages and infections and help with the patency of the catheter. In my role I often have to encourage people to increase their fluid intake for these reasons but I have never once done it in a way so belittling to the patient. I do feel that the staff need to go back to basics when it comes to giving care. A little bit of kindness or compassion would have gone a long way in improving my post-birth experience.  \r\nI feel that my daughter’s birth at RCH was a positive experience but it was unfortunately spoiled by the lack of care I received postnatally on Wheal Fortune ward. The lack of pain relief, the lack of breastfeeding support and the poor attitude of staff made this a difficult and unpleasant ordeal that I am glad I will not be repeating.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-06-10T08:02:37.9166667","progress":"Made change","dateOfPublication":"2020-06-11T11:10:00.357","readBy":[{"name":"Royal Cornwall Hospitals NHS Trust","count":13},{"name":"Plymouth University Health and Human Sciences students, 2018","count":1},{"name":"Kernow Maternity Voices","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/771808","id":"771808"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/771808/responses","id":"771808"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/771808/healthservices","id":"771808"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/771808/tags","id":"771808"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/ref12_422","id":"REF12_422","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/ref12_501","id":"REF12_501","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lack%20of%20care","id":"Lack of care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/access%20to%20pain%20relief","id":"access to pain relief"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/analgesia","id":"analgesia"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/birth","id":"birth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breast","id":"breast"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breast%20milk","id":"breast milk"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breastfeeding%20support","id":"Breastfeeding Support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/catheter","id":"catheter"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/c-section","id":"c-section"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/drug","id":"drug"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fluids","id":"fluids"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/heart","id":"heart"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lovely","id":"lovely"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/murmur","id":"murmur"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain%20relief","id":"pain relief"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/postnatal","id":"postnatal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/postnatal%20care","id":"postnatal care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attitude","id":"staff attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supportive","id":"supportive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/theatre%20staff","id":"theatre staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassion","id":"compassion"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/involved%20in%20decisions","id":"involved in decisions"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/772216","id":"772216"}]},{"id":771860,"author":"Wee eck","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Covid screening testing for appointment","body":"Test was extremely easy, walked through screen, asked pertinent questions re-laying to health and potential contact with anyone who may have been in contact with Covid19.

Could you please let me know, when, these tests are going to be available?  \r\nThank you","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-06-10T16:51:16.0166667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-06-11T11:27:17.52","readBy":[{"name":"Scottish Ambulance Service","count":12},{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":16},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/771875","id":"771875"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/771875/responses","id":"771875"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/771875/healthservices","id":"771875"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/771875/tags","id":"771875"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/c418h_180","id":"C418H_180","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/scot-ambulance-emergency","id":"scot-ambulance-emergency","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ambulance%20crew","id":"ambulance crew"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/excellent%20staff","id":"excellent staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gastro","id":"gastro"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good%20humour","id":"good humour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurse","id":"nurse"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scan","id":"scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stomach","id":"stomach"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tests","id":"tests"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/shortness%20of%20breath","id":"shortness of breath"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/772238","id":"772238"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/772265","id":"772265"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/772408","id":"772408"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/772423","id":"772423"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/772437","id":"772437"}]},{"id":771814,"author":"Emmrd63","authorRoleId":10,"authorRole":"a volunteer/advocate","title":"Community Mental Health Advocacy","body":"Dear Roisin  \r\nI am writing this e mail to command the above person for the support and action she took on my behalf as a mental health advocate .

Asked for several referrals for my recurrent Pain and have been ignored and just given antibiotics. Since two years I’ve been running after this surgery to help me with my pain and I haven’t had my results from tests, neither have I got any referrals to help. They never did A blood test on me, even though I asked for it several times. My mental health has been deteriorating and I asked for help and all I get is that I sound perky and I should stay on the medication I am on already which doesn’t work enough for me. Seems like they don’t take it serious, I’m holding them responsible for several of my issues and that I have not been given the help I need. I can’t describe my disappointment and I am so angry this practice is even open, should be closed as it’s making me feel depressed having to be in constant pain due to incapability of this surgery i feel absolute helpless. GPs should be there to help and take your issues serious. I’m still in pain like two years ago, NEMS platform one has done nothing for me. Also long waiting times, once waited for 1 hour. Ok staff, nice nurses tho but haven’t got much time to actually do anything. 5 mins in and out really. The quicker the better. Antibiotics being prescribed  like tic tacs. Utterly disappointed.
