When I did get the results, it was not good news and I was knocked for six by what the consultant told me, but there was no explanation about it, it was like I just didn’t matter.  Told I would be referred to a clinic and Goodbye.  I have met some lovely people at King George Hospital but this Consultant needs to learn that people have feelings.  At times like this the last thing you want is for someone speaking down at you, with no consideration of the way you are feeling.  When I left this appointment I just broke down and cried.  I hadn’t a clue what it all meant. I had to book an appointment for the next day with the nurse at my GP’s for someone to speak to about it.

She waited >4 hours in the corridor before being seen by a Nurse or Doctor.  As a HCP myself, I have some observations.\nThe ambulance crews were kind, expert and I think were making a huge (clinical) contribution to the A&E service.\nYour staff were calm, polite, always introduced themselves and listened to concerns.\nThe patients waiting to be seen, whether on trolleys or seated (there were many waiting many hours) were calm and uncomplaining, seemingly without expectation that things could be better.\nWe had waited hours at home already, waiting for a HCP to assess and give advice so that we could manage her illness at home, but ended up in the A&E corridor because no one could visit her at home.  After a total >12 hours waiting a preventable admission became inevitable. Discharge was delayed because of home care needs, which had not been an issue at the start of the illness.  I believe the problem was not lack of beds or lack of clinical expertise, but lack of TIMELY clinical assessment and appropriate management.  The pattern of repeated staff shortages in vital areas compounded the clinical and social problem, only increasing the burden on the NHS in the end.\nYour staff in their calmness appeared accepting of a low standard of care (no enquiry or monitoring of fluid intake in a vulnerable person, no attention to the risk of poor skin integrity in a patient unable to move for hours on a trolley).\nThe use of AHPs for routine observations, ECG and phlebotomy was interesting - efficient for all except those who might need additional or no investigations.  Of course there may well have been background conversations we were not aware of...\nAt no time were either my relative or I given any information on timeframe or process.  We were still expecting a decision for discharge home until seen by the doctor late at night (12+ hours after the initial phone call asking for help was greeted with the assurance a doctor would visit her at home soon).\nI look forward to hearing how my concerns can be addressed to optimise the patient journey for your future patients. A short quality improvement project with frequent PDSA cycles may be a way forward.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-01-04T20:05:27","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-01-05T11:13:11","readBy":[{"name":"Royal United Hospital Bath NHS Trust","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/726835","id":"726835"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/726835/responses","id":"726835"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/726835/healthservices","id":"726835"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/726835/tags","id":"726835"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rd130","id":"RD130","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/burden","id":"burden"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ecg","id":"ecg"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/elderly","id":"elderly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hearing","id":"hearing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/skin","id":"skin"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vulnerable","id":"vulnerable"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/731862","id":"731862"}]},{"id":726839,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Helpful friendly efficient surgery","body":"Friary surgery has taken great care of my parents since they were transferred following the closure of their Plymstock surgery.

It's shocking how long you're left waiting in pain, with infections or other things you need help for. Then if you need an appointment that day you're spoken to like you're being dramatic. Although I suspect this is because of the pressure on the administration team it's not helpful when you're not well and need help. It used to be a 3 week wait prior to the merger.

This is extremely painful - like a burst appendix and worse than childbirth. There are also risks of complications. I had nausea, a fever, could hardly move. The person on reception smirked at me. The triage nurse I eventually saw shouted at me for not having taken an ibuprofen (pointless with this level of pain). After hours waiting in agony on a hard plastic chair, while people with minor injuries were treated and left, my blood test results came back and showed inflammation and only at this point was I actually believed. An apologetic nurse took me to a bed and I saw a doctor. The doctor had never heard of an endometrioma before. He seemed to think it was just period pain and initially told me to have an ibuprofen and go home. I had to explain to him what an endometrioma was, what happens when it ruptures, that I needed a scan and that I needed to see a gynaecologist. A while later I had a CT scan. Nobody checked on me for hours longer. Eventually a gynaecologist confirmed the scan showed I had a ruptured cyst, apologised profusely for the fact that I'd just been ignored for hours, and admitted me to the gynaecology ward. I was then finally (after about 6 hours) given appropriate (opiate) pain medication and my haemoglobin levels (which had dropped) were monitored. The consultant said I would need surgery. Fortunately, I had expert endometriosis surgery booked in a few days later (not in Sussex as there are no accredited endometriosis specialists here at all), so I was kept in for pain meds and monitoring for a few days instead. 5% of the population suffer from endometriosis. It's not rare. It's one of the most painful conditions there is, and it can have serious complications. I had endometriosis in my ovaries, bowel, ureters and it had fused all of my pelvic organs together. The endometriosis specialist informed me I was at risk of ovarian torsion, bowel obstruction or perforation, hydronephrosis and sepsis. I had been to the same A&E with the same symptoms year before and was told it was \"probably wind\" -  yet shortly after that a large ovarian cyst was found on a CT scan. I know A&E is overstretched. But that is even more reason to triage effectively. And it doesn't cost anything to treat patients with respect rather than open suspicion and hostility. If I hadn't been knowledgeable about my condition, and able to advocate for myself even while in intense pain, then I might have been left without appropriate medical care at all. Sadly this is typical of the medical profession's current attitudes towards endometriosis and other conditions that affect women. Have some unconscious bias training, Brighton A&E, and do better.

I stayed in hospital for 3 days and I am so grateful for the compassion, care and help from the midwives and assistants on the labour suite and Bonington ward. We were left to enjoy skin to skin bonding with our baby and given helpful practical advice to get breast feeding started before we left hospital.

Day for them to call me around 1pm he then proceeded to be arrogant and rude to me telling me I wasn't getting phone surport and was there anything elese I couldn't talk about my situation or what was happening for me noone cared how I was feeling and why and how I was struggling with situation I was in.I've been trying to help myself and have gone to recovery collage and whenever crisis team is brought up its always a negative reaction so this isnt happening just to me I think a lot of the staff need to look at getting another job cause they clearly can't be bothered to help service users maybe the manager should look at getting people in recovery to volunteer to man the crisis team phones so you can speak to someone that would care and want to surport other service users and talking to someone whom has been in similar situations or have been unwell themselves maybe the crisis phone line would improve I can only say this service and a lot of the staff disgust me and there only a.

I have had to leave rockhealth care after being a patient for 6 years. They never answer the phones but then tell you you should have rang at 8am when you finally get through nearly 2hrs later. When they do answer they are rude an unempathic. I visited 3 times in 3 months - once for blood tests that were requested by a private practitioner for my thyroid, once for a smear test and once for my annual blood tests due to a genetic condition I have that causes an increased risk in cancer. On my third visit of which was the only one related to my genetic condition I was quite bluntly accused of being a hypocondriac. The nurses words were you need to stop letting this genetic condition get to your head and had I even been diagnosed with this condition'  I  was so disgusted and upset by this comment that I changed GPs immediately. I have been diagnosed and have to have several screenings due to the fact I'm at an 80% risk of cancer and at a young age. I try my best to manage this condition but the one thing I need is a gp surgery who will take me seriously when I have symptoms. The first time I had a bad experience was when I was repeatedly told by a nurse at rock healthcare that I'm far to young to get bowel cancer and it's highly unlikely. I had to argue with her for several minutes that this isn't the case with my gene, she kept pushing her argument when she didn't even know what my condition was when I first walked in. News flash my dad was only 36 and Stephen Sutton was 18 so unfortunately no it doesn't matter that I'm young. Absolute disgrace of a surgery and shows how detrimental private healthcare services are for our NHS. I'm writing this now as I have been trying to call for my husband's results from a stool sample he sent in over a week ago. I have been unable to get through for 2hrs now when actually his results should have been ready last Tuesday but we can never get through and we know he has an infection as I have the same one from food poisoning. My new gp surgery got my sample a day later than his and I've nearly finished my antibiotics. However he's still waiting due to the complete mess that is rock healthcare. He has now just handed in his forms to change to my gp who also answered the phone within 2mins this morning for me to get a sick note. So unfortunately rock healthcare can't blame 'a sign of the times' as other gp surgery's in bury have got it right.

Very little was done and I had to sit in terrible pain for several hours.  I was given tramadol which helped for a while.  I did not have any scan or xrays they did bloods eventually to check for a clot on the lung, which it was not.  Despite my saying to the Dr I have severe problems with my spine that meant a disc could have bulged he insisted I could not have that problem in the area that is giving me such pain.  I was actually sent home in agony and told to go to my gp, the hospital could only offer morphine which I cannot tolerated have a bad reaction to, they did not even have oxycodone which I can have a little of said they did not have it in the department.  I feel this is a discrace and very typical of how some Drs view back problems.  I am very much in control of my pain issues and have a high pain threashold normally and this was very much out of the ordinary to have this level of agonising pain.  In fact I was taken in by ambulance.  I had an earlier visit on New Years eve with this pain and they gave me some valium just 3 2mg tablets to take over 3 days, which temporarily helped but the lovely lady doctor I saw then said to me to come back if the pain got worse which it did.  What a very variable service.  I left the hospital in agony hardly able to stand up and only walk a few yards.

I had naughtily attended my regular GP on Tuesday afternoon regarding a repeat prescription for another condition while stifling my other developing symptoms thinking I was being wise and only dealing with one complaint in an appt. I attended another GP for an emergency appt on the Friday afternoon and after some checks it became apparent that I was quite a bit poorlier than I was letting on (very high temp, tachycardic and high BP). The GP was concise, calm and understanding and referred me to be reviewed at Hairmyres Hospital ASAP.  \r\nOn attendance to Hairmyres I was taken fairly quickly and triaged by Joe who repeated my observations and performed an ECG and took lots of bloods. He went out of his way to chat and joke with me and my husband and allowed me to be the patient and not a professional. Joe made a notable effort to speak to his colleagues and take me directly to the medical assessment unit without delay.  \r\nIn MAU I was greeted quickly by Dr Rachel who again had such a lovely manner and friendly demeanour and treated me as an active person in my own care. I was seen quickly at X-ray and my bloods came back to reveal early pneumonia.  \r\nI have never been so glad that my common sense prevailed over my “aw its fine - other people are worse off” mentality and I have never been prouder to be part of an NHS who care so deeply and treat patients as sensible individuals.  \r\nI, myself, have received feedback from this site on my own care for patients and would be delighted for all involved to be applauded for this evening.
