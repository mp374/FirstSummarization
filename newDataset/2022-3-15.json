At first I wasn’t too concerned as we are both regularly tested and I was under the impression that we were each other’s only sexual partners. However when I spoke to him about this he mentioned that he MAY of had sex with other men since his last HIV testing.  \r\nAs I’ve only really had two long term partners and believe in being open and honest which people prior to sexual relationships I didn’t feel I would benefit from PrEp. Granted that it was unfortunate that the condom split but given other ongoing medical episodes worrying about potentially contracting HIV was a concern.  \r\nGiven it was the weekend I unsuccessfully tried to contact a sexual health clinic and just as I was considering A&E I rang the Open Clinic at Branston.  \r\nImmediately the lady on reception put me at ease, as this was my first time using this NHS service she was extremely helpful, friendly and engaging.  \r\nI then spoke to Charlotte (nurse) who explained the options available to me. Charlotte was again extremely professional, friendly and showed empathy. The challenge was that the possible medication had to be administered by a doctor and the nearest doctor was in Stafford.  \r\nCharlotte took ownership for the situation, went above and in my opinion beyond to ensure I was being looked after. I was offered a face to face appointment on the same day.  \r\nThe level of care was more than I expected everything was fully explained and Charlotte gave sound recommendations for me to consider going forward I.e PrEp vaccination for hepatitis etc as well as going into detail about the PEP meditation I was been given. At no point did I feel uncomfortable or judged and I can only say a massive thank you to all the team.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-03-12T13:00:33.2133333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-03-15T11:19:31.35","readBy":[{"name":"Midlands Partnership NHS Foundation Trust","count":6},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2022)","count":1},{"name":"Ulster University, MBBS (Medicine) 2021","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/923300","id":"923300"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/923300/responses","id":"923300"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/923300/healthservices","id":"923300"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/923300/tags","id":"923300"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rrex4-sexual-health-services-hivss","id":"rrex4-sexual-health-services-hivss","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/advice","id":"advice"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/condom","id":"condom"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/empathy","id":"empathy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hiv","id":"hiv"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/level%20of%20care","id":"level of care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/non%20judgemental","id":"non judgemental"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/receptionist","id":"receptionist"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thankful","id":"Thankful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/clear%20explanations","id":"clear explanations"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/face-to-face","id":"face-to-face"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/925865","id":"925865"}]},{"id":923857,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Exellent service","body":"I have visited your Shrewsbury clinic 4 times over the last 2 years.

You are not wrong another waste of time.

Happy days all sorted or so I thought, I found myself having to ring back as I could not access what I needed although I had stated the problem. Another 30 minutes later again 5th in the queue come on are they having a laugh or what I explained the problem to the same receptionist more huffing and puffing, I felt almost like I should apologise for daring to ring with a request, eventually all sorted.

Really appreciate just how busy they are but lots of things seem to be going wrong.\n\nFor the past 10 weeks I have been chasing a cancer referral to hospital where you are meant to be seen in 2 weeks. Except for my cancer the wait list is longer just to get to the 1st appt. I managed ( with difficulty) to get the duty doctor to see me but since then the referral has gone missing, the hospital can't find trace and so the GP needs to send again.\n\nI can't find out from the practice what has gone wrong and no matter how many times I have left messages or emailed or used that online form throughout Jan and Feb - no reply. And so far the hospital still hasn't received a referral. \n\nI would be normally inclined to think a large hospital had lost it but the practice can't find any trace of sending nor of my many attempts to follow up. My husband has been waiting even longer for follow up injections to do with cancer treatment that the hospital wants the GP to give but the practice says again no record of any request. I even handed in his letter to prove but nothing has moved on.\nThe receptionist said they haven't had a practice manager for over a year which is very concerning and maybe because it must be such a hard job. But surely there is a spreadsheet or to do list of outstanding admin jobs that need following up? These are urgent. \n\nWe really don't know what to do next and feel quite desperate . Covid seems to have made the practice grind to a standing halt and it never got going again. It is such a shame as been there a long time but maybe it is just too big a practice with too many staff and so too much gets lost.

I was treated very well in A&E. I really felt sorry for them and the sheer amount of patients waiting that they have to look after.  \r\nThe public need their eyes opened to the state of Emergency Departments currently. The amount of patients I saw lying on trolleys in the corridors is ridiculous – I thought this really bad for elderly people.  \r\nAll the staff in the Emergency Department were absolute pets – really brilliant. One nurse in the amber section in particular was really great.  \r\nUp on the Female Surgical Ward it has been lovely. The staff members are all brilliant. I would particularly like to mention both Maura and Fiona who have been unreal during my stay here.  \r\nI would like to particularly say that a smile really does go a long way. One morning Maura came in all bright and cheerful with a smile on her face saying “Good Morning Ladies” and it really lifted our spirits for the rest of the day and made all of us patients on the ward closer to one another.  \r\nThe only thing I think needs improving is the visiting restrictions in place for unwell people.  \r\nThe Southern Trust must be the only hospital trust in Northern Ireland which is still restricting visiting in this massive way. Are the staff just too used to not having visitors now?  \r\nI also feel that staff need to make patients more aware of their visiting rights and when they are allowed a visitor in, as many of us are clueless with regards to what the rules actually are.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-03-13T15:51:13.16","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-03-15T14:29:35.73","readBy":[{"name":"Southern Health and Social Care Trust","count":4}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/923428","id":"923428"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/923428/responses","id":"923428"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/923428/healthservices","id":"923428"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/923428/tags","id":"923428"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_33020_180","id":"ZT003_33020_180","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_33020_502","id":"ZT003_33020_502","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctors","id":"doctors"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good","id":"good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/smile","id":"smile"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgical%20ward","id":"surgical ward"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/visiting","id":"visiting"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fine","id":"fine"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/visiting%20restrictions","id":"visiting restrictions"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency%20department%20staff","id":"emergency department staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%20rules","id":"covid rules"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/spirits%20lifted","id":"spirits lifted"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/923940","id":"923940"}]},{"id":923429,"author":"Fioew57","authorRoleId":8,"authorRole":"a staff member posting for a patient/service user","title":"Only one improvement - WiFi signage","body":"I came into the emergency department with possibly the worst flare up of my ulcerative colitis ever.

Both nurses were shocked I’ve not been told anything about not drinking or eating the night before or anything at all really!!  \r\nWriting this I have an anxious wait of a few more days till my op please wish me luck 🍀 as I’ve not really slept since receiving my letter! If someone could please let this lovely nurse know how special she is I would be truly grateful!  \r\nOne of life’s very few angels, I feel much better now and maybe a little crackers to say I’m looking forward to my operation and finally after over 2 years of waiting hopefully I will be pain free.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-03-11T17:10:29.0066667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-03-15T16:04:10.267","readBy":[{"name":"United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust","count":5}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/923127","id":"923127"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/923127/responses","id":"923127"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/923127/healthservices","id":"923127"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/923127/tags","id":"923127"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rwdla_110","id":"RWDLA_110","score":3},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/terrified","id":"terrified"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood","id":"blood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20pressure","id":"blood pressure"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ecg","id":"ecg"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hip","id":"hip"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/information","id":"information"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/short%20notice","id":"short notice"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/weight","id":"weight"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassionate","id":"compassionate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/explanations","id":"explanations"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid-19%20test","id":"covid-19 test"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/925752","id":"925752"}]},{"id":923090,"author":"Sheevy08","authorRoleId":4,"authorRole":"a relative","title":"Admission of my elderly mother","body":"My mother - who has Alzheimer's disease - was referred for admission with a suspected stroke by her GP following an emergency house call. The paramedic were faultless - helpful, professional, kind, caring, cheerful and very attentive. Sadly, that was where the good times ended...  \r\nFrom the moment we arrived at QEH, the treatment of my mother during the admission process was disgusting. There were no trolleys available, so she was forced to sit in a wheelchair (with a suspected stroke!) in a corridor with her pyjamas and only a thin standard-issue blanket. . This would have been OK if it had only been for 30-60 minutes but four hours later, we were still stuck in a corridor with not so much as even the offer of a cup of water!  \r\nThe treatment my mum endured was not only incredibly cold and uncaring but quite simply unacceptable in this day and age. Staff seemed to be totally unaware of the fact she was even there and not one of some 60 - 80 people who passed even gave her a smile or asked how she was doing... just incredibly poor on all levels. She was then subjected to the same questions THREE times over about her health by fairly brusque and unfriendly staff who didn't tell us anything and just cast us back out in the corridor when they were done.  \r\nBy this time my mum was almost delirious and fading before my eyes. I asked one nurse if they knew where I could get a cup of tea and you would have thought I had asked for spare pair of kidneys! Very ungraciously replied that they'd get my mum a cup of tea - and when I said it was OK, and that I don't want to trouble them if they could just tell me where I can go to buy one that would be fine, they loudly and gruffly asked does she want one or not. I was appalled and several of the other patients waiting seemed to feel the same.  \r\nAt another point I asked if someone could help me take mum to the loo... a nurse came and asked if she couldn't manage herself. I replied no, as she's in her 90s with dementia and a suspected stroke. Another nurse showed up who was more helpful if rather rough and kept urging mum loudly to stand up. When I pointed out she had lost her major motor skills they tutted and then unceremoniously lifted her back into the wheelchair.  \r\nWhen she finally got taken into a cubicle it was yet another waiting game until I finally asked if my mum could at least lie down now. A nurse helped me get her into bed. Mum, of course, promptly fell asleep - by this point totally exhausted and very confused.  \r\nI have always been a huge supporter of the NHS but if this is patient care in 2022, then god help us all! This was easily the worst experience of customer care I have ever had.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-03-11T14:35:56.4533333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-03-15T16:10:14.833","readBy":[{"name":"Scottish Ambulance Service","count":10},{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":5},{"name":"St. Andrews University ScotGEM Medical Students","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/923090","id":"923090"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/923090/responses","id":"923090"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/923090/healthservices","id":"923090"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/923090/tags","id":"923090"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/scot-ambulance-emergency","id":"scot-ambulance-emergency","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/south-glasgow-hospital-accident","id":"south-glasgow-hospital-accident","score":1},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confused","id":"confused"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/uncaring","id":"uncaring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/alzheimer's","id":"alzheimer's"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bed%20availability","id":"bed availability"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dementia","id":"dementia"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency","id":"emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/exhausted","id":"exhausted"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/geriatric","id":"geriatric"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/paramedics","id":"paramedics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attitude","id":"staff attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stroke","id":"stroke"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unfriendly","id":"unfriendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting%20times","id":"waiting times"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wheelchair","id":"wheelchair"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/access%20to%20water","id":"access to water"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20kept%20informed","id":"not kept informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/offer%20refreshments","id":"offer refreshments"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care%20and%20attention","id":"care and attention"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/924127","id":"924127"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/924187","id":"924187"}]},{"id":923292,"author":"bornfree","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Prioritising patient wellbeing","body":"I was diagnosed with advanced Prostatic small cell Cancer around 5 weeks ago. It has been a very emotional time. After my first chemotherapy my temperature spiked and I ended up back in Monklands hospital. I was told my Neurophills were very low and i was at risk of further infection so needed to stay in a room on my own. Although the care staff have been fantastic I was moved from one room to another and then at 4 o'clock in the morning I was woken up to be told I was moving rooms again. I was forced to wake up and pack my room in a few minutes ready for a porter. I complained and a nurse had the decision to move me reversed, but the damage was done. Startled and wide awake. I am physically and emotionally drained by the last few weeks and i feel that the needs of the hospital were put above the needs of the patient. If this was to happen in a prison it would be seen as unacceptable. It has made me want to just throw in the towel and stop all treatment. It's very hard being away from my family when I know my time is short and it's not too much to ask to be treated with a little humanity by ward managers. I would like my case highlighted. Decision makers need to understand the impact that poor decisions can make on a patients mental and physical well-being, and sometimes the need to manage a bed is second to proper and compassionate patient care. Also and separately I am concerned that given the fact that I am immuno-compromised I really shouldn't be moving to several different rooms and wards. Even a layman can tell that this would constitute poor infection control decision making.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-03-12T07:19:48.5666667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-03-15T16:48:01.907","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lanarkshire","count":6},{"name":"Scottish Government","count":1},{"name":"Partnership for Change","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/923292","id":"923292"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/923292/responses","id":"923292"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/923292/healthservices","id":"923292"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/923292/tags","id":"923292"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l106h_370","id":"L106H_370","score":3},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bed%20management","id":"Bed management"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cancer","id":"cancer"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/chemotherapy","id":"chemotherapy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/depressed","id":"depressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctors","id":"doctors"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/infection","id":"infection"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medical%20care","id":"medical care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nursing%20team","id":"nursing team"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassion","id":"compassion"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emotionally%20drained","id":"emotionally drained"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/like%20a%20number","id":"like a number"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/uncared%20for","id":"uncared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/moved%20around","id":"moved around"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sad%20angry","id":"sad angry"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/woken%20at%20night","id":"woken at night"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/empathy%20from%20management","id":"empathy from management"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/924820","id":"924820"}]},{"id":923953,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Helpful friendly ","body":"All team pleasant , friendly,  professional. \nOn time , very thorough and explained everything x\nEasy parking .clean and plenty seating ","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-03-12T19:46:06","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-03-15T17:04:33","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/923953","id":"923953"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/923953/responses","id":"923953"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/923953/healthservices","id":"923953"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/923953/tags","id":"923953"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/nmk","id":"NMK","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/parking","id":"parking"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/924440","id":"924440"}]},{"id":923951,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Professional and caring service","body":"I was admitted to ward 35 for four nights to be treated for cellulitis.

I decided to attend alone rather than have them be late. As it happened as soon as I arrived I was rushed from registering into the changing room and back out. While waiting for my husband to come for me I realised I had over exerted myself.  \r\nIn the rush and the pain and exhaustion and breathing issues I have hit me like a brick. I found myself leaning against a wall in the main forum area across from the info desk with my vision going funny and struggling to breathe. I must’ve been there around 15/20 mins wheezing and shaking all while medical staff walked past. My husband who arrived to pick me up stared worrying as I was ignoring his calls and he couldn’t see me came in and said I was visibly looking awful, he asked at the desk where the wheelchairs were so he could bring one to get me to the car (I was now almost on the floor and hunched over my crutch). The staff member there just pointed and didn’t even ask if everything was ok, which of course if they had looked they would’ve seen! The wheelchairs are completely inaccessible for people arriving, incidentally. My husband spent a good while getting me up and into the chair all while more staff passed by, and got me out of the hospital.  \r\nSeveral weeks later I had to attend for a related test and after my previous experience there was no way I was going without my carer (husband)! We arrived at the dept and the staff member who was booking us in refused to let my husband in. I explained that he was my career and I’m entitled under the equalities act to have him with me to which they just replied that it was due to Covid. I said that covid doesn’t magic away my rights but without even letting me finish my sentence it was repeated, no, because of Covid. They then said that the dept. would look after me - absolutely not! So I asked if he was refusing my care and they just shrugged. We left the dept. My husband was angry as he knew I needed the test so he spoke to someone at the information desk and there was a member of staff who overheard and called the dept back who said they would allow me to have my carer we just had to wait 5 minutes before going back. When we did go back they did let us into the deptartment - the first staff member was now nowhere to be seen - but they still refused to allow my husband to accompany me to the room which isn’t great as I struggle to remember all the info I’m given. Thankfully the person doing the test related important info about my test to my husband in the waiting room. That wasn’t very great for confidentiality but better than being left.

By the time you get through appts may have gone. You should be able to book a future appt for ongoing or non-urgent treatment. Shouldn’t such an appt be convenient to both parties, isn’t that the idea? Being referred to the website is a joke. No appts currently available, surprise, surprise. I admire their skills and knowledge but the more they earn the fewer GP appts are offered.

The end of it is always a message saying somebody will call at any point on a random date 2-4 weeks away, from a random Doctor.\nWaiting times are ridiculous. Sometimes it has passed so much time for my initial form and a call with a GP/nurse that my issue has resolved on its own, with me in pain and suffering in the meantime.\n\nAdmin staff and receptionist are very inefficient, they forgot so many times to send me over documents about medical plan, and I needed to ring them to remind them more than 4 days in a row in one occasion.\n\nSome of the GP are rude as well. We come to this practice because we are in need of help and not to waste our and your time. Please listen to us. We are not making up symptoms and after waiting more than a year for one of my problem to receive the right attention, I asked to an open referral letter to get a second opinion to go private, and I was not even able to do so. \n\nThere are so many areas this practice needs to improve on.

There were 2 ladies that were on duty this morning that I felt did everything they could to put me at ease and in general made the experience less nerve wracking. I explained that in the past it has taken nurses 6 or 7 goes before finding any blood and without hesitiation they knew exactly what was best to do and thorughly examined my veins before attempting to take blood.
