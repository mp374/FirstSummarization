Throughout this time CBT has been recommended by mental health workers and doctors, but I have struggled to access it due to waiting lists and being transferred between different mental health teams and services. In November 2019 I self referred myself to Let's Talk about a month later had a telephone assessment and a CBT appointment in January, at a date, time and location that I could choose.  \r\nI constantly found the sessions to be unstructured, sparse (in content) and inconsistent. For example, a homework would be set one week, and treated of little importance the next (not linking it to any particular goal, skill etc.) and wouldn't be brought up until I mentioned it, but at other times when I struggled to complete the homework I would be made to feel guilty, and the therapist would continue assigning the same homework rather than trying something different. From the homework that I was assigned, I did not acquire any new skills that were effective coping strategies or techniques that lead to an improved behavioural outcome.  \r\nWhen I did communicate my negative thoughts, the therapist didn't challenge them, but enabled them in many cases. For example, when I explained that I was anxious about making an academic appeal with the university \"because I feel like I have let down the university and wasted the opportunities that they have given me, even though they have already made plenty of allowances for me\", I thought to myself that I had finally said something that might be \"usable\" and that we would start doing the cognitive behavioural thing I was hoping for , but they didn't do anything to challenge that particular thought pattern and the avoidance that it leads to but instead treated it as if it was a casual conversation and expressed sympathy for that view point.  \r\nThe therapist didn't support me in a long-term goal that I have been struggling with for a number of years (it is one which I have previously made successful initial steps in but struggled after that). When we discussed the problem, there was absolutely no challenging of the negative thinking that surrounds it.  \r\nI often struggled to express myself during the sessions and felt judged for this. It may have been partly due to the fact that I wasn't able to establish a relationship of trust with the therapist in the small number of sessions, but I think that this was contributed to by ineffective use of questioning by the therapist. Whilst I understand that open-ended questions probably have an important role in avoiding dictating to patients and giving them freedom to express themselves, the reliance on that particular style of questioning didn't work for me. As somebody who is introverted and has difficulty when talking about emotive and sensitive subjects I have an instinct to give the least that is possible when asked general, open-ended questions (not sure if they were technically open-ended questions as I'm not an expert on questions but that is how I perceived them as they seemed to lack precision). To me it seems clear how this open question style might disadvantage a range of personality traits, behaviour patterns (i.e. avoidance), people with differing abilities to express themselves for a variety of reasons and I feel that this where I struggled with counselling/talking therapy and was hoping that CBT would offer a more structured and investigative approach so that I would feel supported in communicating more of my thoughts.  \r\nI'm not saying that as a patient I should take a passive role in the CBT, but asking the right questions in order to gain an understanding and insight is surely the bread and butter of being able to help to find a solution to any problem. I've had a quick browse through some of the other stories on this website about Nottingham IAPT and at least one other person describes the sense of the therapist \"not getting to the root cause\" of an issue.  \r\nBeing asked \"What can I do for you?\", \"what would you like to get out of this session?\" etc. at the beginning of each session contributed to a sense of non-continuity, and that we weren't working towards goals and developing skills and made me question whether they remembered what was said in the previous session or whether they had taken adequate notes.  \r\nDuring the sessions they would ask how they were doing as I'm sure they could sense that I was struggling to communicate but this just added an additional role that I had to carry out when I was already struggling with trying to \"perform\" what seems to be required as a patient (I've written more about this idea later). I should add that I wasn't deliberately withholding information from the therapist, it's only after a period a reflection that I have some sense of why I acted in a certain way and what could have helped. It's disappointing that the therapist didn't seem to have the skills or framework to analyse the situation and find potential solutions for my lack of communication and instead seemed to judge me for it.  \r\nWhen a discussion did manage to arise in the dialogue that we had did not contribute to any new understanding on my part. I didn't learn anything insightful about my mental state or thought process from the therapist, and often it felt like the responses were rehearsed rather than being relevant to my situation - I would agree with the assessments but they were quite general and something that I had already recognised in myself, and these assessments weren't really linked to anything else, I wasn't given the skills or techniques to challenge these particular thought or behaviour patterns.  \r\nThey kept telling me that \"CBT wasn't suitable for me\" or that \"I wasn't ready\", without explaining why or what the alternatives might be. They would often contradict himself and retract things that were said in a previous session. The therapist complained that they were \"doing too much work\", adding to my feelings of guilt and the sense that I can never be helped, and if they were doing any work I didn't feel like I was benefiting from it. The sessions would often leave me in tears (which I expected to happen as it was advised that this might be a possibility on the appointment letter) but I wasn't given any techniques to deal with this and it wasn't used as an opportunity for learning.  \r\nThere wasn't anywhere I could go to collect myself and calm down when I left the sessions in tears, apart from the only bathroom which was a single-stalled bathroom which opened directly into the hallway. I was lead to believe that I could potentially have more sessions if I wasn't making any progress, but was discharged because I didn't make any progress.  \r\nAfter each of the interactions I've had with mental health workers I come away with a sense that there seems to be some specific performance that they are looking for, even though I am unable to quite put my finger on what that performance might be, my ability to carry out this performance seems to be a necessary condition attached to the quality of care provided. I was finally given a clue to what this might look like at the end of the final session (I was trying to make sense of all of the contradictions being made so was losing focus of what they were saying) but the therapist talked about me re-referring myself in several months time and had ideas about what those therapy sessions might look like - saying something to the effect of \"You're going to learn things about yourself which you won't like/ you will learn that you think things about yourself and won't understand why you think that way/ it will be difficult but when you are ready you will share with other people\". I found it fascinating how they didn't seem to have planned the next week's session but was able to glimpse months into the future to tell me what my therapy would look like. It seems to be at odds with the sense of flexibility which I suspect they were trying to create (depending on which week it was), but which was ultimately an illusion.  \r\nEven as someone who suffers from persistent negative thoughts, I would never have thought of my self as helpless and usually retain a sense of hope that things will improve, which is what leads me to seek help from mental health services and self-refer for CBT. But unfortunately the repeated, unsuccessful interactions with mental health \"professionals\" is increasingly engendering this mindset - I'm starting to get the sense that I am trapped in a web and the more that I do to try and escape, the more tangled I am becoming and it is has added a new element to suicidal ideation. Increasingly I am thinking that I am in the wrong for hoping or believing that anyone can help me and the deleterious effects on my mental health that I am experiencing are a natural outcome of such a foolish assumption.  \r\nThe service which was supposed to alleviate my long-term mental health issues and has caused more harm than benefit, and I am left with little to no support in the aftermath. I went into the treatment with an open mind and determined to make the most of the opportunity only to be completely disappointed and let down by the service. I have wasted time which I can never get back and feel like I've drifted further from my goals than I have ever been during the course of these sessions.  \r\nWhether it's an institutional problem, an academic problem or simply one of quality assurance it's safe to say that until there is a (visible) system of accountability for mental health workers then I believe little has changed since the time when lobotomies were a common treatment for mental health patients.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-03-31T14:35:08.0833333","progress":"Story has a

She has dementia and became unwell a couple of days before with rather vague symptoms . She was off her food / drowsy / nil liquids etc , paramedics attended ( fabulous guys who put her at ease ) . They explained due to the current pandemic I could not be with her through her assessment however they would explain to the nursing staff that it was desirable I was present to answer questions she cannot answer herself , this did not happen and indeed my mother was left on her own for five hours on a trolley while I sat in a separate waiting area patiently waiting on an update .  \r\nEventually I approached reception to be told the day staff had not informed the night staff I was there!!!! I was ( five hours later allowed to be with her ) she was then transferred to a medical receiving ward . At no point did any of the staff wear protective equipment .  \r\nThe next day I telephoned to be told she had pneumonia . She was subsequently tested for covid 19 and tested positive . At no point did anyone suspect this and no personal protection equipment was worn by any staff . My mum was treated promptly and efficiently by the staff in ward 50 ( the second ward and third department of her 24 hr visit ) . I was then allowed a one off visit wearing said PPE . During this visit staff cane round with the ‘tea trolley’ and one member of staff kindly made mum tea . She wore no gloves / mask and kindly fixed mums oxygen ( nostrils ) then proceeded to go to the next room . A member of the medical team spoke to me re DNR .  \r\nMum improved and the following day happily continued to improve , sadly in isolation. You can only imagine how difficult this would be for her . The following day I was informed she was being moved to ward 7 . A lovely member of the medical team phoned me to explain what was happening . Due to the fact she was covid positive you will be aware myself and my family are currently in isolation for 14 days . I explained this and this was met with reassurance due to her dementia she would be looked after until able to be sent home .  \r\nSadly from that moment this has not been the case . She was subsequently moved to ward 46 having had one negative result for covid and then one positive . I was informed this was the best place for her .. . She remained there through Monday , I assumed until discharge . Sadly on tues evening less than 48 hrs in this dedicated ward I was phoned at 9pm to be told she was being moved again to ward 62 that evening . No explanation was given other than we need the beds and we are more of a receiving ward . I ask the question why move an80 yr old woman with dementia there in the first place ?  \r\nShe is now being moved to her fourth ward and sixth room in her ten day stay . No visitors ( I understand the difficult time we are all having ) The ward cannot tell me which consultant she will be under . She is by now agitated , confused and lost . Do you consider this fair and person centred care of an 80 yr old patient with dementia and covid .  \r\nShe will be once again lost and agitated and confused. She will also be under another medical team . I am baffled and as a staff member of GG and C frankly very saddened .  \r\nI would appreciate a response  \r\n","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-03-31T20:44:18.0733333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-04-01T10:40:46.15","readBy":[{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2021)","count":1},{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":9},{"name":"Office of Ken Macintosh, MSP for West of Scotland","count":1},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/753392","id":"753392"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/753392/responses","id":"753392"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/753392/healthservices","id":"753392"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/753392/tags","id":"753392"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/g107h_340","id":"G107H_340","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confused","id":"confused"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dementia","id":"dementia"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/efficient","id":"efficient"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/infection%20control","id":"infection control"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/isolation","id":"isolation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/moved%20ward","id":"moved ward"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/oxygen","id":"oxygen"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/paramedics","id":"paramedics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pneumonia","id":"pneumonia"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/prompt","id":"prompt"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/saddened","id":"Saddened"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/person%20centred%20care","id":"Person centred care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/family%20kept%20informed","id":"family kept informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/explanations","id":"explanations"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/baffled","id":"baffled"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid-19","id":"covid-19"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ppe","id":"ppe"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/753427","id":"753427"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/753434","id":"753434"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/772015","id":"772015"}]},{"id":753419,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Very unprofessional ","body":"I am not a person to leave reviews but this time I actually think is needed.

This was my 4th baby and I had breastfed my older three but I learned so much that I didn't know about breastfeeding from Lana at this class. Lana made me feel so at ease and look forward to labour and delivery, instead of feeling worried and anxious. Lana taught me breathing and relaxation techniques that I'm still using now. These techniques helped so much in pregnancy and labour.  \r\nI have brittle asthma and my pregnancy and labour/delivery was high risk but I felt much more relaxed and in control using the techniques and strategies that Lana taught me. Everything was explained clearly and with such reassuring calm that I looked forward to them classes so much! If I missed anything Lana always took the time to make sure I knew and understood what I missed, always going the extra mile with all of us at the class.  \r\nAfter my son was born Lana was in touch with me. She must spend hours personally getting to know every new mother but she is there to support everyone whenever she is needed. My baby had a tongue tie which Lana helped my midwife refer. He had this cut at a week old. Then he developed thrush. I took him to the doctors twice in two weeks, each time with different treatment. Nothing was working. It was Lana that told me what treatment he needed, what we both needed. I went back to the doctors and was prescribed the correct treatment. The doctor asked me to get in touch with Lana to ask what dose I should be taking and how often. This was 5.30 on a Friday night. I messaged lana and she replied with the dose /frequency. After a couple of days we were both so much better and enjoying feeding. Such a shame it took three weeks to get the right treatment but without Lana we wouldn't have even got it then. She is a legend. The fact the GP refers back to get says it all. Any time I've had an issue, Lana has been on hand every on the phone or she'll pop round. From boobing to pooping, I wouldn't have felt so comfortable or confident without Lana's support and I certainly wouldn't still be feeling myself 6 months later. She helped us with the tongue tie, thrush, poor latch and reflux. Poor baba did not have it easy. I would have given up without Lana. She worked with us both to help with all his wee issues and keep feeding going. Lana also runs a feeding support group that we go to. This is open to anyone and we are welcome to come and go as we can. Lana is always so welcoming and makes time for everyone there. She always offers you a cuppa and a treat and has a chat. Everyone there is very friendly but that's because Lana makes you all feel so welcome and relaxed. When my baby was first born lana was weighing the babies at the group. She would only do this is you had your red book so she would record it. This was excellent as seeing the health visitor is extremely tricky. (There is a health visitor clinic once a month for a couple of hours but guaranteed that is when your in laws call round or you've been up all night or car is in the garage or something always happens making it impossible to get to that window to get the baby weighed. I have only once made it in 6 months!) I am very lucky that the health visitor has came for a home visit and I had my baby weighed three times. I know several other mums who never had their babies weighed after hand over from the midwife. It was a brilliant service that Lana offered weighing the babies. Such a shame she can't do it any more. It must have really helped the health visitors too as without this service loads of babies were never getting weighed at all. Not only could the mums keep track of their babies weight but if there was any concerns then this could be flagged up. I'd love to see Lana weighing the babies at the group again. I'd love to know how heavy my wee toot is now! Lana is you read this thank you so much for everything. Please keep up the amazing work you do, we couldn't do it without you 💖. Only one thing, bring back your scales 😄.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-03-31T22:11:13.08","progress":"Story has a

had returned from holiday the doctors thought I had picked up a bacteria, they put me in a side room, and anyone coming into see me had to wear protective clothing.  \r\nMy blood was taken every 6 hours to see what bacteria would grow, everyday I got my medication changed, the nurse in charge, I can't remember their name, was adamant they wanted my bed back for some one that needed it more, I could hear them say I wouldn't be staying, they needed that room and didn't care - like I wanted to be there??  \r\nThe nurse got their way and I was sent home after 5 days in hospital, following day I was readmitted for the same symptoms, there was no beds so I was booked into toxicology ward, the ward where over doses and mental health patients are kept in a locked room. Following day the gastroenlogy doctors came to see me, they now felt it was my ulcerative colitis rather than a bacteria, they sent me home with medication, for 3 weeks I got more and more ill, I handed a stool sample into my GP who confirmed I had salmonella! And had had it for 6 weeks, which all the doctors at the royal had failed to diagnose,  \r\nFollowing week I was sent to have a colonoscopy, the doctor performing the procedure asked why I was on so much medication, I informed him I had salmonella - he hadn't been informed - he told me he would puncture my insides with anything going inside them given how inflamed they would be.  \r\nI lost 15% of my body weight. 2 Stone, my BMI is now 17 and all my muscles have wasted away  \r\nFive months since I first got sick I am still unwell with reactive arthritis in my hips caused by the salmonella, my ulcerative colitis is constantly inflamed, I can't do basic tasks due to the lack of muscle I now have and I am not back at work full time  \r\nI was under the hospitals care for 3 weeks and they failed to diagnose a basic food poison that I had been displaying all the symptoms of and I was in the correct gastroenterology ward  \r\nPerhaps if the nurse wasn't so adamant I was to leave I would have been given the care I deserved and needed  \r\nThe Royal infirmary couldn't protect me","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-03-31T23:28:12.5333333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-04-01T11:12:02.703","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lothian","count":6},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/753400","id":"753400"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/753400/responses","id":"753400"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/753400/healthservices","id":"753400"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/753400/tags","id":"753400"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/s314h_301","id":"S314H_301","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/arthritis","id":"arthritis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood","id":"blood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bmi","id":"BMI"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/colitis","id":"colitis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/colonoscopy","id":"colonoscopy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diagnose","id":"diagnose"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hospital%20discharge","id":"hospital discharge"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/misdiagnosis","id":"misdiagnosis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ulcerative%20colitis","id":"ulcerative colitis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/weight","id":"weight"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication%20between%20departments","id":"communication between departments"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/753431","id":"753431"}]},{"id":753405,"author":"liseday","authorRoleId":3,"authorRole":"a parent/guardian","title":"My son's illness","body":"My son, who was a young very fit man, developed acute Crohns.

Unfortunately just as we went into lockdown because of Covid19 his conditioned worsened and he needed a stoma, bypassing his big colon. Surgery went well but he came home after only two days, because of the danger of the virus. My daughter-in-law and I tried to give him the level of care required but because he was so nauseous and had deep painful hiccups for days on end it was very difficult. He was scared of eating. Last night he collapsed and we called an ambulance. They arrived in 15 minutes and showed such professionalism, care and compassion. Now he is getting his stoma unblocked and being hydrated.

He had appendicitis and was treated with outstanding care throughout.  \r\nAs parents we were clearly worried about our son, however all staff from out of hours Doctor, Nurses & Doctors in Wards 19 & 20, Anesthetist, Surgeon and Nurses within the operating theatre gave care which we cannot thank them enough for. Everything was explained to us whilst we were also asked if we understood or had any questions. Our son was able to tell them when worried or scared and all who were involved gave him explanations he could understand and reassurances that everything happening was OK.  \r\nOur son also has Autism and his needs were always taken into consideration even the anaesthetist asked what would make this easiest for our child to understand and she spoke to him direct in a way he could relate. We stayed for 2 nights, and can only speak highly of the paediatric team. Simple things like the food options for meals, the playroom when fit enough after surgery and just the smiles on the nurses faces has made our son have nice memories of his short stay in hospital which have helped him forget about the pain and fear he had whilst there. He says they took away his worries about hospital but especially Nurse Jackie in ward 20. Jackie cared for him the day of his surgery prior to theatre and when he returned to the ward. As well as care, she was helping with his dressings when one came off, calming him down with us when he got anxious and encouraging him. Thank you Jackie and everyone involved.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-04-01T11:58:53.09","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-04-01T13:14:57.623","readBy":[{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2020)","count":1},{"name":"NHS Lanarkshire","count":7},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/753423","id":"753423"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/753423/responses","id":"753423"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/753423/healthservices","id":"753423"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/753423/tags","id":"753423"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l308h_420","id":"L308H_420","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxious","id":"anxious"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/answering%20questions","id":"answering questions"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appendicitis","id":"appendicitis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/autism%20awareness","id":"autism awareness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20about","id":"Cared about"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/food%20choice","id":"food choice"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helped","id":"helped"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassurance","id":"reassurance"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20for","id":"cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/explanations","id":"explanations"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/753430","id":"753430"}]},{"id":753424,"author":"gymthing","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Treatment options.","body":"After having an anxiety/depressive episode, I was urgently referred to Ealing CATT team by my GP, dealing with psychiatrist Dr. Sufraz.

Here I would have to be reviewed in order to continue receiving NHS funding for my treatment, which also at Treliske unusually includes a compulsory \"patient contract\".  \r\nWhat followed was a string of appointments issued then cancelled by the hospital within a few weeks of each being issued, this continued for over 6 months. In the mean time, as I had not received one appointment that the hospital would keep, my life saving medical supplies were running out. Various local NHS medical staff and myself attempted to speak with specialist staff there for approx 10 weeks, leaving messages, sending emails and formal letters, but no-one at Treliske helped, they did not communicate with either me as a patient, my GP's or any community based NHS staff. At this point I gave in and after much NHS fighting I managed to organize myself an appointment in Devon. It appears to me that the adult insulin pump clinic at Treliske operates to block adult patients from accessing insulin pump therapy. I think they should feel ashamed at how this hospital treated me as an adult type 1 diabetic patient on insulin pumps, and I believe they really need to change their attitude, be retrained or should be closed down. I had contacted complaints team, but they didn't get back to me. The pump team clearly knew that this problem existed but did not act on it. It's good to see a now publicly available RCHT adult insulin pump service pathway document, but sadly it doesn't include any information on service accessibility or had any patient input, lots of patients being made to jump through hoops but no commitment or accountability from clinical staff or managers - if RCHT would like some help with this please contact me. Overall my experience conclusion in attempting to receive pump therapy at RCHT is I will avoid using this hospital at all costs in future.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-03-27T16:40:57.5666667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-04-01T13:25:10.723","readBy":[{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2022)","count":1},{"name":"Royal Cornwall Hospitals NHS Trust","count":4},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2020)","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/753018","id":"753018"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/753018/responses","id":"753018"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/753018/healthservices","id":"753018"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/753018/tags","id":"753018"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/ref12_307","id":"REF12_307","score":1},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/abandoned","id":"abandoned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ignored","id":"ignored"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stressed","id":"stressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/access%20to%20services","id":"access to services"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/accountability","id":"Accountability"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appointment","id":"appointment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cancelled%20appointments","id":"cancelled appointments"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/caring","id":"caring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/depressed","id":"depressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diabetes","id":"diabetes"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/insulin","id":"insulin"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/insulin%20pump","id":"insulin pump"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lack%20of%20appointments","id":"lack of appointments"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lack%20of%20communication","id":"Lack of communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/organisation","id":"organisation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attitude","id":"staff attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unhappy","id":"unhappy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/type%201%20diabetes","id":"type 1 diabetes"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/753435","id":"753435"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/753463","id":"753463"}]},{"id":753019,"author":"Johnson100","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Diabetes Specialist Nurse in Outpatients","body":"I've now had a couple of face to face appointments and numerous telephone appointments with the diabetes specialist nursing service in outpatients and have to say they are fantastic!  \r\nTheir clinics rarely run late, are very focused on problem solving diabetes issues while still being friendly, helpful and generally supportive.

The appointment ended somewhat abruptly when I refused to discuss taking medications that had no influence on my blood glucose levels and the same ones I had previously refused to take.  \r\nI left very unhappy and upset for the second time by a consultant clinic appointment, leaving in tears from my appointment where I felt I was being harassed and bullied with no consideration or respect was given to my choice of treatment, my opinion or my clinical decisions. Overall I felt that the consultant was being driven by a box ticking process with no concern for the individual, patient rights or the consent.  \r\nAt the appointment there were 3 staff members in the appointment room with me, but no-one had asked if I was ok with this. Including one doctor that was just apparently observing, it made me feel very uncomfortable, especially when they smirked at me as I was disagreeing with the consultant.  \r\nIt's a shame as it could be a really good clinic and much more accessible than most others in the south west, but sadly too many assumptions are made about patients and no respect is given to type 1 patients who ironically deliver their own care 100% of the time, it's so important for a consultant to work with a patient not to attempt to dictate treatment to them- this ruins lives. I really hope some productive changes can be made.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-03-27T17:54:48.04","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-04-01T13:25:19.507","readBy":[{"name":"University Hospitals Plymouth NHS Trust","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/753025","id":"753025"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/753025/responses","id":"753025"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/753025/healthservices","id":"753025"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/753025/tags","id":"753025"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rk950_307","id":"RK950_307","score":2},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/concern","id":"concern"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/isolated","id":"isolated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scared","id":"scared"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20upset","id":"very upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/accessible","id":"accessible"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20test","id":"blood test"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diabetes","id":"diabetes"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hba1c","id":"HBA1c"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/individualised%20care","id":"individualised care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/insulin%20pump","id":"insulin pump"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/listen%20to%20patients","id":"Listen to patients"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/outpatient%20clinic","id":"Outpatient clinic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/punctual","id":"punctual"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/respect","id":"respect"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/uncomfortable","id":"uncomfortable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unhappy","id":"unhappy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/involved%20in%20decisions","id":"involved in decisions"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/felt%20unsafe","id":"felt unsafe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/less%20clinicians%20in%20appointment%20room","id":"less clinicians in appointment room"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/753703","id":"753703"}]},{"id":753021,"author":"Johnson100","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"practice nurse appointment","body":"I had an appointment with a practice for a B12 injection, given that the Corona virus had started to spread significantly when this appointment was due I wasn't sure if they would still see me.  \r\nI received a phone call from nurse in advance to reassure me that they would still see me for this appointment and were taking measures to ensure that the waiting area would be safe even for higher risk patients such as me.  \r\nI only had to wait a couple of minutes before the appointment, it went well, quick and painless, she organised me a further appointment for the future.

I wanted to thank them for looking after me and for doing a great job.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-04-02T08:34:39.13","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2020-04-02T09:55:42.323","readBy":[{"name":"United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust","count":10},{"name":"The Stroke Association","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/753500","id":"753500"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/753500/responses","id":"753500"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/753500/healthservices","id":"753500"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/753500/tags","id":"753500"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rwdla_300","id":"RWDLA_300","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scared","id":"scared"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/all%20staff","id":"all staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/company","id":"company"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/face","id":"face"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/informative","id":"informative"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/looked%20after","id":"looked after"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/patient-centred","id":"patient-centred"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stroke","id":"stroke"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"}]},{"id":753465,"author":"Speedyman","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"I had not slept properly for many years","body":"I was becoming physically ill as a result of our son's life style.

I do not wish to tarnish all the staff with the same brush. My complaint relates to two individual members of staff who were \"looking after me\" on a night shift.  \r\nTheir introduction was abrupt and rude and they immediately made it clear that their approach was that I would do things their way. Their care was not patient centred and was very dominant. I was experiencing a lot of pain post surgery and was also experiencing shoulder and arm muscle spasms making it very difficult to hold and feed my baby.  \r\nThe previous midwife had organised regular strong analgesia for me and told me to inform the night staff that I would require this hourly. I let the two new staff members know who completely dismissed my request, saying that they wouldn't jump straight to that and that I could just have ibuprofen. I explained that was not sufficient but my concerns were ignored. I then explained that without the pain relief, I would therefore need help to pick up and feed the baby - as even getting in and out of bed was difficult. The response from one member of staff was that they were not going to be at home with me, and told me that I would have to manage by myself.  \r\nDuring this introduction I felt intimidated by the two people standing at the end of the bed, who were ignoring all I was saying and making it very clear I should pipe down and get on with it on my own. I felt ganged up on and bullied. My heart sank realising how difficult the night ahead was clearly going to be and my pain began to increase due to being denied the pain relief. Subsequently my arm went into spasm causing me great distress. One staff member physically tried to manhandle me to the bathroom, saying I needed to empty my bladder as I had been previously catheterised and ignored the pain and distress I was in. I sat on the edge of the bed, trying to explain I could not move and in a lot of pain and they just huffed and told me to go back to bed and tried to get me to lie down, again ignoring my distress. They then repeatedly criticised me throughout the night when I struggled to feed my baby every three hours, yet offering no help and continuing to ignore my exhaustion and pain levels. They also told me off for failing to complete a feeding chart, when I had never been given one or told to use one by anybody.  \r\nThey asked another patient if they were ok in the next bay, and when they said they were, loudly said something like 'well at least someone is doing well and managing fine' I felt as if to highlight that I was a troublemaker.  \r\nI was continually promised that someone was coming to assess my baby's tongue tie throughout my stay but they never did, despite my repeated requests to multiple staff members. In the meantime, I had to unnecessarily struggle to breastfeed my baby and have the tongue tie cut post-discharge. I found this unsatisfactory when the baby's tongue tie was identified immediately following birth, yet three days later by the time of my discharge, no action had been taken.  \r\nI was close to discharging myself as I felt completely unsupported, bullied and unnecessarily criticised. I felt I could better care for my baby at home which says a lot about the lack of care I received that night. I was vulnerable, in a lot of pain and felt completely alone and frightened. It was a very negative experience.  \r\nI was shocked at the way I was treated as a patient.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-02-25T20:32:59.7566667","progress":"Change planned","dateOfPublication":"2020-04-02T11:24:07.393","readBy":[{"name":"Plymouth University MNurs Nursing 2019-09","count":1},{"name":"Royal Cornwall Hospitals NHS Trust","count":17},{"name":"Plymouth University Health and Human Sciences students, 2018","count":1},{"name":"Kernow Maternity Voices","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/744857","id":"744857"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/744857/responses","id":"744857"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/744857/healthservices","id":"744857"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/744857/tags","id":"744857"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/ref12_501","id":"REF12_501","score":1},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frightened","id":"frightened"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ignored","id":"ignored"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/isolated","id":"isolated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lack%20of%20care","id":"Lack of care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/alone","id":"alone"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/analgesia","id":"analgesia"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/childbirth","id":"childbirth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/c-section","id":"c-section"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/delivery%20suite","id":"delivery suite"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/intimidated","id":"intimidated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/maternity","id":"maternity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgical%20team","id":"surgical team"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unsupported","id":"unsupported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vulnerable","id":"vulnerable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/on%20edge","id":"on edge"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/753515","id":"753515"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/758498","id":"758498"}]},{"id":753511,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Thank you Ward F9","body":"My dad is in ward F9 at the moment and I’m unable to visit him due to isolation.

After 2 days with no response at all (not even a holding email saying the surgery was extremely busy) I ended up ringing the surgery.\n\nI've had an appointment letter sent to me and when I arrived at the surgery there was no appointment. This is fine if you're retired but I work and have to take time off to get to the surgery.\n\nI've had one receptionist be unapologetically rude to my face when they didn't want to help.\n\nWhen I've had appointments booked they often start late - usually only 5-10 minutes late, but sometimes up to 3/4 hour after the scheduled appointment was due.\n\nI've had one GP say they will make an appointment for me with the hospital and after a three week wait for a letter its transpired that hadn't been done, leading to further delays getting the hospital appointment.\n\nI've also had distinctly unsympathetic responses from some members of staff in relation to things I've sought help for. I appreciate that not every medical complaint requires a massive investigation, I appreciate doctors, nurses and receptionists are often extremely busy, and I appreciate everyone has off days but a show of at least some sympathy goes a long way.\n\nI find it disappointing to say that as a result of numerous small things like those listed above I have lost faith in this practice and the level of care it offers. I often feel like I'm fighting an uphill battle for even minor issues and it concerns me that one day, as I get older, I may need their assistance with something more serious because small errors can lead to early warning signs being missed and this surgery seems dogged by these kinds of small errors.\n\nI'm should say (rudeness excepted) I'm sure no-one at the practice is deliberately providing poor service. The GPs and staff seem to work long hours and it must be disappointing for them to receive critical feedback, but service often seems stretched a little thin. Hopefully this can be improved though!","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-04-02T10:27:54","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-04-02T11:25:57","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Sheffield ICB","count":4},{"name":"Healthwatch Sheffield","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/753512","id":"753512"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/753512/responses","id":"753512"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/753512/healthservices","id":"753512"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/753512/tags","id":"753512"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/c88010","id":"C88010","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/face","id":"face"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/signs","id":"signs"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/753583","id":"753583"}]},{"id":753518,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Great practice","body":"Had a very painful/worrying finger infection and was treated by doctor in A&E, a plastic surgeon.

The demand for their time has increased exponentially, then overlaying this, we're in the midst of an pandemic. Knoll has risen to the challenge with an easy-to-use online 'e-consult' solution for when you REALLY need to see the doctor. I used this recently when I was quite unwell, and I can't praise enough how well this works. Go to the Knoll Practice website, and complete the questions which are well laid out and cleverly adapt to the symptoms you describe. The questions are straight forward and do not take long to complete. You simply submit your answers, you receive confirmation via email and sms, and then you're given a diagnosis or follow up advice next day. I used the service recently, submitting my online form in the evening. I received a response and prescription next day, which was transferred to my pharmacist and I was able to collect my medication same day. Great use of technology, which saves time and does away with the need to go into the surgery which helps everybody. Great idea, well executed. That said, please only use this facility, if you are really unwell. It's a good resource, but we must use it wisely. Well done to all at the Knoll and massive thanks for all the good work you do for the community.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-03-22T11:07:21","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2020-04-02T14:41:49","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/753525","id":"753525"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/753525/responses","id":"753525"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/753525/healthservices","id":"753525"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/753525/tags","id":"753525"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/g84032","id":"G84032","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diagnosis","id":"diagnosis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good","id":"good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/feel%20very%20lucky","id":"Feel very lucky"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thanks","id":"thanks"}]},{"id":753249,"author":"Mel mel","authorRoleId":4,"authorRole":"a relative","title":"Requiring an inhaler during this peak time of the virus","body":"Called in to request for an inhaler to help me with my breathing during this corona breakout.

Birth trauma is horrific and I am forever grateful the Grampian for providing a trauma specialist as part of their service, especially as one as experienced and fantastic as Shona.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-04-02T11:17:41.85","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-04-02T15:27:33.497","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Grampian","count":2},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":1},{"name":"Scottish Recovery Network","count":1},{"name":"Yorkshire & Humber Patient Safety Research Collaboration","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/753510","id":"753510"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/753510/responses","id":"753510"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/753510/healthservices","id":"753510"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/753510/tags","id":"753510"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/n161h_501","id":"N161H_501","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/birth","id":"birth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care%20plan","id":"care plan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20about","id":"Cared about"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/depressed","id":"depressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helped","id":"helped"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/informed","id":"informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/perinatal%20mental%20health","id":"perinatal mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/person-centred","id":"person-centred"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/postnatal%20depression","id":"postnatal depression"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/specialist","id":"specialist"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/therapy","id":"therapy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fantastic","id":"fantastic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/experienced","id":"experienced"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/753542","id":"753542"}]},{"id":753516,"author":"AC1979","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Suspension of therapy amidst the pandemic","body":"I had a therapy session yesterday, via telephone, and was told that my therapy is to be suspended for an unknown time due to the coronavirus pandemic. As much as i understand the reasoning for this, I felt I must explain why, for me, this is terrifying.  \r\nI have been seeing a therapist for nearly a year now. Due to my issues, it is ongoing, with no clear end date as of yet. I came to therapy with crippling anxiety and depression and was also quickly diagnosed with an Anxious Avoidant Personality Disorder. My therapeuric journey is a LIFE-CHANGING journey. It had to be, as I could barely function, was not 'living' due to extreme anxiety and fear etc. It has taken to this point for me to, only just, start changing how I think and deal with life, meaning I am at possibly the most crucial part of my therapy because I am starting to shed my harmful ways of thinking which makes me extremely vulnerable at this point as I am on very unsteady ground. Therapy is like my anchor, and my ONLY truly safe space. It is the only place I can talk about ANYTHING I need to talk about. I cannot just make do with talking to friends or family, if that was a possibility, I would not have had to go to therapy in the first place. I need the therapist/patient dynamic in order to feel I can talk freely, without judgement or shame, and without causing the ones I love extreme concern. Therapy is where I am shown other ways of looking at things, doing things, and shown things in a perspective other than my own that I am unable to see myself. I understand that this crisis is huge, and I understand the extreme pressure on the NHS more than any others, but it is this crisis that makes me feel it is more important than ever to continue my therapy as stopping now will almost certainly prove catastrophic, as I am in a very unsteady place, effectively functioning with a borrowed 'shield'. By 'shield', I mean self-worth/confidence/self-respect and the many other things that allow us to live a fairly healthy well-rounded life.Therapy is my borrowed shield, therapy is where I am constructing my own shield. I am also a 'key-worker' as a home carer which brings it's own anxiety due to the current pandemic and I know that in order to keep working, to keep going outside I need to stay in therapy. My biggest fear just now is not the coronavirus, it is the thought of trying to cope with all of these things on my own. I am fairly certain I can't cope on my own. Which means my mental health may revert to how it was a year ago, barely leaving the house etc, and then become ever more exacerbated by the worldwide crisis. Thank you for your time.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-04-02T11:39:37.3966667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-04-02T15:51:51.567","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Education for Scotland","count":1},{"name":"NHS Borders","count":12},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2020)","count":1},{"name":"Scottish Government","count":1},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":2},{"name":"Scottish Recovery Network","count":1},{"name":"Sheffield University Medical School 2020","count":1},{"name":"Yorkshire & Humber Patient Safety Research Collaboration","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/753516","id":"753516"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/753516/responses","id":"753516"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/753516/healthservices","id":"753516"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/753516/tags","id":"753516"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/b105h-mental-health","id":"b105h-mental-health","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxious","id":"anxious"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/concern","id":"concern"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/crisis","id":"crisis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fear","id":"fear"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/depression","id":"depression"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/important","id":"important"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/personality%20disorder","id":"personality disorder"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/therapy","id":"therapy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vulnerable","id":"vulnerable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/walk","id":"walk"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/suspended%20service","id":"suspended service"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/758060","id":"758060"}]},{"id":753544,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Unbelievable care","body":"I have just been discharged after spending 6 days as an in patient following an operation.

This can be split into two categories.\n1. The patient is unable to let the nurse know what they want, some examples I saw were,\na) The patient was asking to go upstairs and the nurses thought he was really confused and that he was in his own house. He became very agitated and in actual fact he was trying to tell them he wanted to go to the toilet.\nb)The patient is in pain and was not able to tell the nurses. During a day shift the patient became very unsettled and was given a strong pain killer by injection. After the night shift came on he started to become unsettled again that by about 1 he was keeping everyone awake and it was suggested that he might need some pain relief. This was duly given and the ward settled.\n2 Nurses not being able to handle people with dementia. In this I mean that many nurses will try to restrict the movement of a patient who becomes disturbed. I can understand why they do this to keep the patient safe. This was an almost daily occurrence. As I have experience of this I always found the best way was to distract them and leave for a few minutes. This could be simple operations as taking blood pressures.\nMy wife who had Alzhimers Had to go into hospital for some weeks. She had to go into a normal ward  and I was disappointed by the care she got. As a result of this I met with the hospital management and they agreed to improve the training given to staff in the handling of patients with dementia.\nthanks\n","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-04-02T13:33:23","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-04-02T17:08:42","readBy":[{"name":"South Tyneside and Sunderland NHS Foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/753547","id":"753547"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/753547/responses","id":"753547"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/753547/healthservices","id":"753547"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/753547/tags","id":"753547"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/r0b01","id":"R0B01","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confused","id":"confused"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disappointed","id":"disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood","id":"blood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dementia","id":"dementia"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/injection","id":"injection"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/normal","id":"normal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain%20relief","id":"pain relief"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/safe","id":"safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20disappointed","id":"very disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thanks","id":"thanks"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/768943","id":"768943"}]},{"id":753546,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Brilliant patient care","body":"I've just finished 8 weeks light treatment at the dermatology department.

With just a few positive interactions, I am truly disappointed in the service provided.\n      I have brain cancer and even though I was feeling poorly (was dizzy, had extremely poor vision, lack of appetite and numbness), I have been denied appointments (even call back from a GP).\n      Another big problem is that I don't have just one GP- I am seeing different GP's every time (when I can actually get to see one) and most of the time they are not fully aware of my health problems (which is normal with the extremely high volume of patients as they are human). \n     Even though I have severe allergies to medication and have repeatedly informed the staff, they failed to put that anywhere on my records (after numerous reminders from my part they finally wrote down just one of my many medication allergies).\n      I have been given the wrong medication due to misdiagnosis a couple of times - once even got to Royal Derby Hospital with a severe infection due to that (in that specific context, I have spoken with three GP's over the course of one month- no appointment as I could not get one, went there first thing in the morning). Doctors rushed trough the consultation- which was a maximum of 4 minutes long, the time they used to switch me to another medication without any medical tests. \n     I can understand the high amount of stress NHS and GP Practices are under, however, people lives are at stake and they should stop receiving patients if they are not equipped to deal with the high volume of people. \n     I have tried to discuss this with various members of staff but these led nowhere. Sadly, I've heard this is a countrywide issue and GP practices are lowering their standards every day. Too bad that this kind of practice is giving a bad reputation to the good doctors and medical staff that might also work there. I would like to believe this is not a malicious trend but rather a lack of training and the result of bad management.

I spent 5 days in hospital in total and I’m sorry to say it wasn’t pleasant. \n\nGiven the current circumstances going on in the world the ward had minimal patients (emergencies only) but still a lot of staff, so I expected the care level to be even higher. I had to have intensive treatment of eye drops every 30 mins (all through the night) this was my only treatment and yet the nurses (on the week days) had to reminded every hour to give me my treatment, which in the middle of the night became very tedious! \nI sat for nearly 3 hours at one point waiting for drops. \n\nGiven the current pandemic everyone is praising the NHS and I have to say the doctors that dealt with me (and 2 of the nurses) were truly amazing but the rest of the nursing staff were beyond a joke and did not make patients feel at ease at all; they were lazy, uninterested, focussed more on gossiping about the current covid situation, what pictures they could put on social media to get praise for their work and more interested in getting their free food. \n\nOn my last day a trainee nurse was in charge of giving me my treatment, he was completely incompetent - he was unaware of which drops I needed and when and had to be reminded constantly. He even forgot to collect my prescriptions and therefore it took 5 hours longer to be discharged! \n\nI was told I had to be in hospital for the best treatment but frankly I could have done better in the comfort and safety of my own home. \n\nI understand times are difficult but patients deserve the best possible care when having to stay in hospital.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-04-02T18:36:49","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-04-03T03:59:32","readBy":[{"name":"The Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals
