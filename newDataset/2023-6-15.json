[{"id":1077898,"author":"bargainrt99","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Lovely staff and support","body":"The diagnosis of breast cancer is devastating to hear. I was in a state of disbelief and felt like they must be talking about someone else. I felt really scared and upset but the clinician and breast care nurses were quick to put me at ease with the plan they had for me and more important told me it was treatable. They reassured me and told me that any questions or queries I had to give them a call.  \r\nThe breast care nurses still support me along with MacMillan support center nurses. They all are very caring and do an amazing job, and are always there for you. They lift my spirits on the days that I might be low in mood, they know exactly the right thing to say. They are truly angels.  \r\nThe morning of my operation I was anxious and worried about going into theatre and how the operation would go. The clinicians, breast care nurses and even physio came to see me on TAU awaiting my turn to go to theatre. When I was about to go into theatre I got upset and the clinician held my hand it showed the human touch it sums up for me how caring and lovely they are. The hand holding, hugs, phone calls proves how much they care.  \r\nThe only suggestion I would make and I would have benefitted from would probably be a drop in group for cancer patients once a week like myself where we could discuss any worries or experiences we had, maybe at like MacMillan centre or in the Hospital? Where we had our treatment which we all come to for our treatment and follow up cake? Maybe a activity group","criticality":"minimally critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-06-13T10:16:56.1933333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-06-15T07:12:18.51","readBy":[{"name":"Chesterfield Royal Hospital NHS Foundation Trust","count":8}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1077898","id":"1077898"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1077898/responses","id":"1077898"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1077898/healthservices","id":"1077898"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1077898/tags","id":"1077898"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rfsda_misc","id":"RFSDA_misc","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rfsda-onclology","id":"RFSDA-onclology","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxious","id":"anxious"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/worried","id":"worried"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breast","id":"breast"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breast%20cancer","id":"breast cancer"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cancer","id":"cancer"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/caring","id":"caring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diagnosis","id":"diagnosis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disbelief","id":"disbelief"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/group","id":"group"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/macmillan","id":"Macmillan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/operation","id":"operation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/physio","id":"physio"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support%20group","id":"support group"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supporting","id":"supporting"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing","id":"amazing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20at%20ease","id":"put at ease"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1078789","id":"1078789"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1080154","id":"1080154"}]},{"id":1078321,"author":"63489","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Thoroughly professional and at the same time engaging","body":"Arrived at reception and instantly met and taken to my bed and introduced to my 2 nurses for the day. They were Queen and Elizabeth - 2 memorable, hard working, friendly, knowledgeable, engaging, thoroughly professional members of staff. My arrival time and their shift end were the same by a happy coincidence, so we spent over 12 hours enjoying each other's company.  \r\nAs with any hospital visit, there is a level of anxiety, as to be expected, however each member of staff that I came into contact with - be they clerical, medical, catering, cleaning - all of them were at the top of their respective games. I apologise that I can only remember the 2 names I've have mentioned, but the Anesthetist and his team are difficult to describe briefly but to say that my time with them was \"fun\". Thoroughly professional and at the same time engaging and made me feel relaxed and confident. The exact comments can be repeated for the Ops Room team. I felt that I was not just a patient but a friend visiting them at work. Bizarre I know, but that's how I felt.  \r\nBeing wheeled back to the ward, we happened to pass tea being served. As I was obviously nil by mouth, my frequent requests for a cup of tea were treated as a joke, which of course they were. But to stop and get me a cuppa just reinforces my previous comments about caring. Evening meal round off with Victoria Sponge that was to die for, if that's not the wrong metaphor. Eventually recovery over and home.  \r\nThank you.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-06-14T09:09:52.95","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-06-15T07:13:11.28","readBy":[{"name":"United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust","count":4}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1078321","id":"1078321"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1078321/responses","id":"1078321"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1078321/healthservices","id":"1078321"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1078321/tags","id":"1078321"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rwdlp_101","id":"RWDLP_101","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anaesthetist","id":"anaesthetist"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bladder","id":"bladder"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cancer","id":"cancer"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/caring","id":"caring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/food","id":"food"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/knowledgeable","id":"knowledgeable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professional","id":"professional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/urology","id":"urology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confident","id":"confident"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/relaxed","id":"relaxed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thankful","id":"Thankful"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1078939","id":"1078939"}]},{"id":1077843,"author":"chassisqr73","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"She brightened up my day","body":"I'd like to express my gratitude to Bethany, who was my community therapist when I came out of hospital after a fall.  \r\nShe was very informative and got me the extra help I needed from different departments including the Drs.

From the moment I arrived at Blossoms it felt like I was being welcomed by my own family. The initial Student Nurse, Maria, was so warm and friendly and engaged with my son beautifully when she was taking his obs. Then the nurse Danielle came in to take his history - she was so calm and reassuring and once again could not do enough to ensure we were both happy whilst we waited for the doctor. The Doctor, Laura-Jane, was just as incredible, completing an examination and diagnosing my son with hand, foot and mouth as well as providing me with all the information on how to ease his pain.  \r\nFrom there we received toys for my little boy whilst the staff observed him, coffee for me and at one point I was even offered a cot and a bed as he was due a sleep. Having previously lived in Australia, I'm accustomed to a first class health service, and I can hand on my heart say that the staff at Blossoms were just as amazing (if not better) as they knew the Irish way of reassuring a worried mum.  \r\nSo a huge thank you to Laura-Jane, Danielle, Maria (and there were two other ladies who provided the toys and helped me with car parking) - thank you for making an anxious trip less anxious and for taking such wonderful care of my baby boy. I hope you know how much you are appreciated - you made me end a bad day with a smile.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-06-13T11:17:06.9266667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-06-15T07:34:44.887","readBy":[{"name":"Southern Health and Social Care Trust","count":6}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1077931","id":"1077931"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1077931/responses","id":"1077931"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1077931/healthservices","id":"1077931"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1077931/tags","id":"1077931"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_32024_420","id":"ZT003_32024_420","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/car%20parking","id":"car parking"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/foot","id":"foot"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hand","id":"hand"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/high%20temperature","id":"high temperature"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/informed","id":"informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/level%20of%20care","id":"level of care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/paediatrics","id":"paediatrics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/rash","id":"rash"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/welcomed","id":"welcomed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/well%20looked%20after","id":"well looked after"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appreciative","id":"appreciative"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thankful","id":"Thankful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wonderful","id":"wonderful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/foot%20and%20mouth","id":"foot and mouth"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1078792","id":"1078792"}]},{"id":1077974,"author":"sagittaze94","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Menopause Service is terrible","body":"I have been seeing the menopause clinic since September last year and find it to be woeful. I'm completely reliant on this service as my GP cannot help me and yet I find the support almost non-existent. I have to chase appointments and when they come through they take no notice of the follow up time specified by the doctor or nurse.  \r\nBy the time the appointment comes round it's useless as they are reviewing out of date blood tests. Last time they didn't listen and were just trying to get rid of me even though I still have a lot of symptoms. More than once they haven't put tests or prescriptions on the system resulting in wasted trips and hours spent at the hospital trying to sort it out.  \r\nIt's impossible to contact them and any communication between the GP takes ages and is very limited. Today it has taken over 2 hours to get a blood test because of this. I feel utterly let down by the service. I understand that all services are stretched but to wait so long between appointments and then the service to be so poor is not ok.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-06-13T12:44:03.9866667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-06-15T07:39:46.213","readBy":[{"name":"Chelsea and Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1077974","id":"1077974"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1077974/responses","id":"1077974"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1077974/healthservices","id":"1077974"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1077974/tags","id":"1077974"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rqm01_502","id":"RQM01_502","score":1},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frustrated","id":"frustrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/inefficient","id":"inefficient"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/should%20listen","id":"Should listen"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appointments","id":"appointments"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20tests","id":"blood tests"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/follow%20up","id":"follow up"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/menopause","id":"menopause"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/the%20system","id":"the system"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting%20times","id":"waiting times"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/feel%20isolated%20and%20let%20down","id":"feel isolated and let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/better%20communication","id":"better communication"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1078813","id":"1078813"}]},{"id":1077975,"author":"whiskeyss43","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Community Therapy Team - Fabulous care","body":"My care was fabulous.

I believe that positivity is a great aid to healing and giving the patient confidence on their journey onward.  \r\nCloughreagh is a gem in an ideal location situated between Newry and Camlough in a Cul de Sac. Fresh country air permeates the entire building with a magnificent view of the Viaduct and Egyptian Arch. It is surrounded on all sides by a panoramic view of Slieve Gullion Mountain range and the Mourne Mountains- A haven of healing.  \r\nThis building is known locally as Cloughreagh Old Peoples Home but the majority do not realise its new purpose- a Rehabilitation Centre/ Short Stay for those seeking to regain their independence post trauma and to go back to their own homes.  \r\nA variety of professionals eg physiotherapy are in place to facilitate individual exercise programmes and to prepare for us to go safely home in a timely fashion.  \r\nThe garden at Cloughreagh is an oasis of tranquillity with seating arranged in such a way to capture the beauty of the shrubs. Garden ornaments enhance the area while a pergola laden with wisteria and various roses adorn the wooden structure. A backdrop of native woodland creates a curtain of green foliage. Pathways meander through this mini forest, an invitation for the fit and able to enjoy a walk or to just come outdoors.  \r\nComing to Cloughreagh post-surgery has given me a new lease of life, I have made new friendships and have gained confidence to face challenges that were impossible to me prior to surgery. I am delighted to know that there is a rehabilitation centre like Cloughreagh to support people in need like me.  \r\nMy life is much more richer for having spent time in Cloughreagh.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-06-13T13:50:21.22","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-06-15T08:03:16.67","readBy":[{"name":"Southern Health and Social Care Trust","count":6},{"name":"Public Health Agency","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1078047","id":"1078047"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1078047/responses","id":"1078047"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1078047/healthservices","id":"1078047"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1078047/tags","id":"1078047"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003-cloughreagh-house","id":"zt003-cloughreagh-house","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/delighted","id":"delighted"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/exercises","id":"exercises"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendship","id":"friendship"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/more%20seating","id":"more seating"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/physio","id":"physio"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/positive","id":"positive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/rehabilitation","id":"rehabilitation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/welcomed","id":"welcomed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confidence","id":"confidence"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/outside%20gardens","id":"outside gardens"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1079817","id":"1079817"}]},{"id":1078067,"author":"skymd96","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"My experience was excellent","body":"The letter and pre-operative admission information was scant at best.

We requested the referral, the GP agreed that it was necessary our son filled out the form that was sent by NeSS.  \r\nOur son is unaware of his difficulties as we have supported him to lead a fulfilled life and not be affected by them, therefore he filled out the form to say that he did not have any issues. We submitted the form along with a range of information about the difficulties he has, provided by all those who know him, along with letter explaining that he is not at all self aware.  \r\nAfter 15 months we contacted NeSS to enquire as to the progression on the waiting list and were told that his referral had been rejected but the letter had never been forwarded explaining this to us, presumably the fault of the GP, although I don't understand why we weren't sent a letter directly from NeSS. We requested a re-referral, which has now been accepted, however the wait time has now increased to 3 years plus.  \r\nThis means that our son (who very much needs this diagnosis) will have been on a waiting list for almost five years by the time he reaches the top of the list, and that's if the wait time is accurate. If we include the time we waited for the pandemic to subside as we were asked to avoid anything except urgent enquiries, then it is almost six. Six years of his life (and ours) where he is not receiving proper support and guidance and we really need this.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-06-13T14:20:58.2366667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-06-15T09:10:26.597","readBy":[{"name":"Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust","count":6}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1078064","id":"1078064"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1078064/responses","id":"1078064"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1078064/healthservices","id":"1078064"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1078064/tags","id":"1078064"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rha-idd-community-ndss","id":"rha-idd-community-ndss","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disappointed","id":"disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/neglected","id":"neglected"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20frustrated","id":"very frustrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/autism","id":"autism"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/understanding","id":"understanding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20concerned","id":"very concerned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting%20time","id":"waiting time"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/speechless","id":"speechless"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1079342","id":"1079342"}]},{"id":1078102,"author":"KH2003","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Made me feel comfortable","body":"I attended for a septorhinoplasty.

Last year, I had a nervous break down. I work in a school, and was dealing with difficult behaviour from the children and felt like I was getting no help. I went to my doctor and he prescribed me some antidepressants, which have really helped me.  \r\nA few months later- I was mid-sixties at the time - I had improved but was still struggling as I have arthritis, back and knee problems - I began struggling at work again. I went back to the doctor and he suggested going to the wellbeing centre to speak to someone.  \r\nLorna was really good, so helpful. I was just really down, and I found her easy to speak to and knew it was all confidential. Lorna gave me exercises to do and suggested I went to mindfulness class, which I have began attending.  \r\nThe wellbeing service has 100% helped. I felt that Lorna was understanding and wasn’t judgemental. I have had counselling before and didn’t know what to expect this time as last time I didn’t feel I could talk to that counsellor as well as I could to Lorna.  \r\nLast week was my last session with Lorna and if felt sad leaving her. We looked at the forms you complete together so we can start to track progress, (it was October last year I started seeing her) and it was amazing to see how far I’ve come on.  \r\nI’ve got a lot more confidence than I had a few months ago. I knew in myself I was feeling better but it was helpful to look back on our last session and see it on paper. I thought to myself - oh my goodness I was really low… It was nice to see just how much I had come on with her help.  \r\nThe GP has also been super and has said he doesn’t want me going back to work. He suggested getting in touch with occupational health at school as well. This has been useful too. I think knowing I wasn’t going back I’ve been able to pull myself together and I now feel a lot better than I had been.  \r\nIt's definitely a service that works well so hopefully continues. It’s done me the world of good. There’s a lot of people out there that are suffering from stress who would also benefit from this service.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-06-13T15:17:46.5566667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-06-15T09:15:46.28","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Borders","count":6}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1078092","id":"1078092"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1078092/responses","id":"1078092"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1078092/healthservices","id":"1078092"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1078092/tags","id":"1078092"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sb9-community-services-wbs","id":"SB9-community-services-wbs","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sb9-gp","id":"SB9-GP","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sad","id":"sad"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/antidepressants","id":"antidepressants"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/arthritis","id":"arthritis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confidentiality","id":"confidentiality"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/counselling","id":"counselling"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctor","id":"doctor"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/exercises","id":"exercises"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helped","id":"helped"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helpful%20staff","id":"helpful staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mindfulness","id":"mindfulness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/non%20judgemental","id":"non judgemental"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/positive","id":"positive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/well-being","id":"well-being"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing","id":"amazing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confident","id":"confident"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported","id":"supported"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1078961","id":"1078961"}]},{"id":1078826,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Appointment frustration","body":"I received letter on 18/6/23 from adult rheumatology regarding an appointment you would be sending.

Her GP surgery for initial diagnosis and support and care throughout, the Guy's Cancer Centre team in SE1 for her cancer treatment care, with surgical care at St. Thomas's Hospital. She had over 22 sessions of chemotherapy and maintenance medications. In the 48 months of her care, we were very grateful for the NHS, as they provided the best care we possibly ask for.  \r\nThe GP helped her be referred to St. Christopher's Hospice for end-of-life care, and along with daily visits from the wonderful Bromley Healthcare team for injections, we helped manage her symptoms and to help her stay as active and mobile as we could. The day a sleek black wheelchair arrived she was very impressed and in turn, it led to a few memorable shopping trips to the local garden centre to stock up summer plants for the garden!  \r\nCancer is a nasty master indeed and she did feel very angry that it had robbed her of time with family and to do things in her beloved garden and sewing. She hated the way she was dying but had dignity and courage until the very end.  \r\nAs a family, we are in awe of all the wonderful and passionate people that came into Mum's life and made each day a little brighter for her.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-06-13T14:25:05.49","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-06-15T09:31:09.473","readBy":[{"name":"Bromley Healthcare","count":4},{"name":"King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1078066","id":"1078066"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1078066/responses","id":"1078066"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1078066/healthservices","id":"1078066"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1078066/tags","id":"1078066"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/8a970","id":"8A970","score":5},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/nqv-district-nursing","id":"nqv-district-nursing","score":5},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rj122_100","id":"RJ122_100","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rj122_370","id":"RJ122_370","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rjz30_502","id":"rjz30_502","score":4},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cancer%20treatment","id":"cancer treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/chemotherapy","id":"chemotherapy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/end%20of%20life","id":"end of life"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/level%20of%20care","id":"level of care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ovarian%20cancer","id":"ovarian cancer"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1078879","id":"1078879"}]},{"id":1078100,"author":"thubanyr83","authorRoleId":3,"authorRole":"a parent/guardian","title":"She was always on our team.","body":"My daughter was referred to CAMHS for neurodevelopment assessment in October 2020. It was a very long, hard wait to be seen with lots of ups and downs along the way.  \r\nWe were finally seen in August 2022 and she was quickly diagnosed with autism. Once the diagnosis was made, lots of support and services became available to us.  \r\nWe were quickly seen by Sarah (OT) and my daughter had a good bond with her straight away. Sarah made us aware of sensory processing problems and how my daughter was struggling to deal with these. This was something I had little knowledge in and Sarah was able to help and guide us through what this meant.  \r\nI had a suspicion that my daughter struggled with balance and coordination because she was unable to do some basic things such as using cutlery or ride a bike. Sarah did assessments and confirmed that she probably does have DCD/Dyspraxia.  \r\nThe biggest impact that Sarah had was that she was always on our team. She attended TAC meetings and sent reports to the school to make them aware of how they could make my daughter more comfortable.  \r\nUp until this, I had teachers and other educational staff telling me that our issues were down to bad parenting, trauma or safe guarding. Sarah was able to tell the “experts” that all our problems came down to sensory processing, DCD or autism.  \r\nWe are now 7 months past her diagnosis and she is back to school full time. She is medicated to ease her anxiety and knows how to communicate her sensory feelings to me.  \r\nWe have attended the forest group and have developed a stronger bond. She has also asked if she can learn how to ride a bike!","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-06-13T15:38:21.36","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-06-15T09:32:47.47","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Forth Valley","count":6}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1078100","id":"1078100"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1078100/responses","id":"1078100"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1078100/healthservices","id":"1078100"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1078100/tags","id":"1078100"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sv9-community-services-cmh-camhsst","id":"SV9-community-services-cmh-camhsst","score":4},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/autism","id":"autism"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/balance","id":"balance"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/camhs","id":"camhs"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care%20co-ordination","id":"care co-ordination"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diagnosis","id":"diagnosis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dyspraxia","id":"dyspraxia"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/group","id":"group"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/information","id":"information"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ot","id":"ot"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/positive","id":"positive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting%20time","id":"waiting time"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported","id":"supported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tac","id":"tac"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1080578","id":"1080578"}]},{"id":1078151,"author":"braids","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"The best service I’ve received","body":"The best service I’ve received, my doctor and her trainee were amazing, very caring and just lovely they are definitely in the right career.

I then had physio at Skegness hospital followed by aftercare from Mr Raj & his team. Fast forward to January 2023 & I had my 2nd total knee replacement at Grantham hospital. The surgeon was again thankfully Mr Raj. The treatment I received was again very good. It's not a nice operation, in fact no operation is, but the treatment by Mr Raj & all the staff are second to none.

I waited 1.5 hours before politely enquiring about when I might be seen only to be told the receptionist ( who I saw clock off her shift ) had not actually booked me in. The new receptionist apologised and directed me to a different area. Here I spoke to a nurse who seemed to think I was trying to queue jump; I made it clear this was not the case and explained I'd been told to come to that area and that for 1.5 hours I had thought I was moving up the queue. \nI was told to go back and wait. Which I did. I was finally seen at 3am. I was given a prescription and told to have a blood test but that it would be a further 6 hour wait. I went home without the blood test as by this point I could hardly stand.\nThe NHS is so underfunded, understaffed and overused. I work in the NHS myself in another sector; I get it. But there was no organisation at Scarborough hospital- it was chaos. \nAn elderly woman had been there alone for 12 hours. Parents with small children 9 hours. People who didn't need to be there; swearing and being aggressive.

Following my retirement I joined the local gym and enjoyed a range of activity classes. I played bridge, had a part time job, looked after grandchildren and all of this stopped abruptly.  \r\nIn March 2023 I was diagnosed with a life threatening illness and hospitalised. I felt like someone had taken me out of my normal life and dropped me in a completely different one, I was not happy. Chemotherapy depleted me of all my energy and I spent weeks lying in bed. I was referred to Joe, the physical activity coach with the Friends of the Cancer Centre, by the hospital physiotherapist.  \r\nJoe assessed my physical capabilities, getting me to do a timed walk etc. I felt I was trying really hard to show him how fit I was but after the assessment I had to lie down I felt so exhausted. Joe made out a plan of exercises for me and gave me a written copy. He came to the ward and encouraged me to do an exercise program along with him. The exercises were all short and appropriate for how I was feeling. He encouraged me to take a drink, rest between movements.  \r\nThe activity programme was short and varied. At first I had to lie down after the 10minute session but it showed me that I could do something. Yes, I was weak but I could see a way through to some level of fitness. It made me feel important and I wanted to try to get back to being me in the middle of the regime of chemo, antibiotics, transfusions. There were times I had to skip an exercise session but Joe never give up on me.  \r\nI did feel this was something I could do for me. I was hospitalised over a 2 month period and was able to continue the exercises via an online platform at home. My life now revolves around hospital outpatients and limited social contacts. The one chink of light in it is the online exercise every week. I look forward to it. It’s tailored to my level, I don’t need any fancy equipment, just a chair, a pillowcase as a resistance band and 2 tins of beans for weights.At last I feel I am improving. My cancer treatment continues and I have no control over that, maybe I can do something to make me feel better at a time when all my usual options are beyond my reach.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-06-14T07:03:47.8066667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-06-15T10:05:16.8","readBy":[{"name":"Belfast Health and Social Care Trust","count":5}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1078280","id":"1078280"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1078280/responses","id":"1078280"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1078280/healthservices","id":"1078280"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1078280/tags","id":"1078280"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt001_02020-pac","id":"ZT001_02020-pac","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/above%20and%20beyond","id":"above and beyond"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/antibiotics","id":"antibiotics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cancer","id":"cancer"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cancer%20treatment","id":"cancer treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/chemo","id":"chemo"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/chemotherapy","id":"chemotherapy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/encouraged","id":"encouraged"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/exercise","id":"exercise"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fitness","id":"fitness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/get%20fit","id":"get fit"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/normal","id":"normal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/physical%20activity","id":"physical activity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/walk","id":"walk"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported","id":"supported"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1078863","id":"1078863"}]},{"id":1078859,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"My Review","body":"On time, professional, communicative, explanatory, considerate, honest, to the point and not, time restricted.

I was also impressed by the anaesthetist duo of Ross and Anastasia who also made me feel comfortable and looked after while also explaining well what would happen to me, including the risks.  \r\nI really wanted to add this as I am sure people are quick to complain about bad NHS experiences so I felt compelled to share my good experience.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-06-14T08:52:05.4033333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-06-15T10:09:22.4","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Fife","count":4}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1078306","id":"1078306"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1078306/responses","id":"1078306"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1078306/healthservices","id":"1078306"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1078306/tags","id":"1078306"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/f704h-daysurgery","id":"F704H-daysurgery","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/day%20surgery","id":"day surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/explanation","id":"explanation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/important","id":"important"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/knowledgeable","id":"knowledgeable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/looked%20after","id":"looked after"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/welcoming","id":"welcoming"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/impressed","id":"impressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassuring","id":"reassuring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/comfortable","id":"comfortable"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1078860","id":"1078860"}]},{"id":1078857,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Receptionist was not helpful.","body":"I went to the surgery just after.9.30ish this morning with a swollen eye due to an insect bite.

They shoved the pre check list then shouted me through, calling me the wrong name, rolling their eyes and leaving me to sit alone with the noise or the CT & MRIs in the background. They also did not give me the direct instruction to sit so I accidentally followed them and as I take things literally, only asked about underwire on my bra so I forgot about the metal adjusters due to feeling so uncomfortable. This really made me worried I wouldn’t tolerate the scan I have waited years for, due to covid and other underlying health factors.  \r\nLuckily for me this member of staff was finishing as I was about to go in for my procedure. Thankfully all 3 radiographers I encountered were amazing and noticed I was anxious and sent me out to wait with my relative before calling me back in. I was difficult to cannulate for contrast but all staff involved made me feel reassured and listened to. I was talked through the whole process of the procedure and supported throughout and it really lessened the increased anxiety caused by their colleague.  \r\nI cannot fault the radiographers who went above and beyond to ensure I was ok after the scan. Their practice was caring, compassionate and person centred which was really appreciated. Hopefully, their inclusivity and positive attitude filters down to their colleagues in future as they were amazing.  \r\nI would like to thank them for making my experience the least distressing.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-06-14T06:42:40.6933333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-06-15T10:29:21.783","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":6}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1078278","id":"1078278"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1078278/responses","id":"1078278"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1078278/healthservices","id":"1078278"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1078278/tags","id":"1078278"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/g505h-xrays-and-scans","id":"g505h-xrays-and-scans","score":3},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nervous","id":"nervous"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20being%20listened%20to","id":"not being listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/above%20and%20beyond","id":"above and beyond"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/autistic","id":"autistic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/caring%20staff","id":"caring staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/concerned","id":"concerned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dismissed","id":"dismissed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mri","id":"mri"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/radiographers","id":"radiographers"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/rudeness","id":"rudeness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scan","id":"scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/understanding","id":"understanding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassionate","id":"compassionate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported","id":"supported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/explanations","id":"explanations"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/comfortable","id":"comfortable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/listened%20to","id":"listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/no%20introduction","id":"no introduction"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/person%20centredness","id":"person centredness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/calling%20patients","id":"calling patients"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxious%20at%20first","id":"anxious at first"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1078872","id":"1078872"}]},{"id":1078299,"author":"Cat67","authorRoleId":3,"authorRole":"a parent/guardian","title":"The service provided was outstanding","body":"My son had been attending Physiotherapy at Altnegalvin Hospital for a number of years on various issues he has.  \r\nI want to thank the physiotherapists on the level of care and expertise they showed in treating him.

The problems were self-induced as I failed to recognise the symptoms of a urinary tract infection that caused cystitis and potentially other problems had it not been rectified quickly.  \r\nSubstantial pain whilst attempting to pass urine eventually became so hard to bear that I went to my local pharmacy. Me being a man my pharmacist explained she was unable to prescribe antibiotics - had I been a woman she could have helped. She referred me to The Vale Minor Injuries Unit in Alexandria and the duty doctor there diagnosed the cystitis and prescribed antibiotics. Luckily the MIU wasn't busy at the time I attended so they were able to see me but be aware you should obtain an appointment through NHS 111 prior to attending.  \r\nDespite being on antibiotics there was no sign of an improvement in my condition a few days later and my local GP surgery sent out a nurse practitioner to assess me, and she prescribed a stronger antibiotic. Overnight that night I had a major bleed in my sleep that blocked my urinary tract and I woke in severe pain from fluid retention.  \r\nI called NHS 111 and their clinician said I had to attend the A&E Department at RAH Paisley. My neighbour is away on holiday so I called all the local taxi firms and none of those that answered the phone had taxis available so I called NHS 111 again and they arranged for an ambulance and told me to call 999 if my condition or anything else changed. I eventually contacted another neighbour who kindly agreed to take me to the RAH so I called 999 ambulance and they explained the ambulance was almost at my house.  \r\nThe ambulance and neighbour arrived at the same time but as I was in severe pain I elected to go in the ambulance, which I'm glad I did. The ambulance crew were fantastic and very observant as my colour and manner were apparently giving them some concern.  \r\nOn arrival at A&E they were expecting me and after only a very brief wait I was taken in for assessment. Due to the pain I was clearly in they dispensed with an ECG and a doctor came in to say he was going to fit a catheter as quickly as possible. I was given a pain killer and after a short wait the catheter was installed and the relief from pain was instantaneous. My concern throughout had been cystitis getting backed up into my kidneys with far more serious consequences. After a brief rest to allow the effects of the pain killer to wear off I was able to return home.  \r\nLesson for me is to be more aware of the symptoms of a UTI. I'd been warned after my elective procedure it was a real possibility and had been given verbal and written advice on what to look for. Sadly I expected that whatever other symptoms to look for, I would always have a temperature and that didn't happen. As a result I wrongly thought I didn't have a UTI and my symptoms were merely due to the original procedure.  \r\nHowever, despite my stupidity at every step the NHS has been fantastic. I'll be having the catheter removed at the end of June and rest assured I'll be extremely aware of what my body is telling me after that.  \r\nFor now I'd just like to record my heartfelt thanks to NHS 111, the MIU at The Vale in Alexandria, the Nurse Practitioner from my GP's surgery, the ambulance crew and A&E at the RAH Paisley - you were all fantastic, caring and professional.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-06-14T09:34:16.9433333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-06-15T10:39:21.147","readBy":[{"name":"NHS 24","count":21},{"name":"Scottish Ambulance Service","count":2},{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":11}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1078330","id":"1078330"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1078330/responses","id":"1078330"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1078330/healthservices","id":"1078330"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1078330/tags","id":"1078330"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/c206h-miu","id":"C206H-miu","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/c418h_180","id":"C418H_180","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/nhs24-111","id":"NHS24-111","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/scot-ambulance-emergency","id":"scot-ambulance-emergency","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sj9-general-practices","id":"sj9-general-practices","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/advice","id":"advice"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ambulance%20crew","id":"ambulance crew"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/antibiotics","id":"antibiotics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bleed","id":"bleed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/catheter","id":"catheter"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cystitis","id":"cystitis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctor","id":"doctor"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fantastic%20care","id":"fantastic care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/in%20pain","id":"in pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/minor%20injuries","id":"minor injuries"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurse%20practitioner","id":"nurse practitioner"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain%20relief","id":"pain relief"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pharmacy","id":"Pharmacy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professional","id":"professional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/severe%20pain","id":"severe pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/short%20wait","id":"short wait"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/urinary","id":"urinary"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/uti","id":"uti"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20well%20cared%20for","id":"very well cared for"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1078883","id":"1078883"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1079300","id":"1079300"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1079420","id":"1079420"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1080441","id":"1080441"}]},{"id":1078878,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Awful","body":"Poor service.
