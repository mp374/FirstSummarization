I’d never attended anything like it. It takes an educational approach to coping mechanisms, dealing with situations and learning about types of mental disorders. It involves a lot of group work, but there is no pressure or judgement and the teaching staff were fun, engaging and understanding.  \r\nUnfortunately, my time there was cut short because of the pandemic starting in the middle of my first term there. Understandably, the college had to shut. However, I then received absolutely no communication from them whatsoever. No updates, no forwarding of resources to help us continue things at home, no checking in to see how we were doing. Not even a message or letter etc to encourage us to contact them if we needed someone to speak to. This was particularly disheartening as it was a programme that encouraged looking out for each other and supporting each other. They had our contact details, and a lot of people relied on this service for structure, a reason to get out of the house and interact with people, a useful tool in helping them cope with life. Yet there was nothing to help us in the pandemic. Thankfully, I did not rely on this service heavily enough for the lack of contact to have a huge detrimental affect on my life, but I know a lot of others did and I really hope the lack of support did not cause them too much distress. It was quite sad to think it was all an act, that they didn’t really care at all and as soon as there was a reason to wash their hands off us completely without the repercussions of us being there to react in front of them, they took it. I know it’s probably not as deep as that, but it certainly felt like it. Especially given the nature of people that use this service, it was rather insensitive and disappointing for us to be left with nothing, to be cut off so abruptly.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-01-14T02:19:26.6766667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-01-15T09:34:08.463","readBy":[{"name":"Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust","count":4},{"name":"Healthwatch Slough","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/816387","id":"816387"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/816387/responses","id":"816387"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/816387/healthservices","id":"816387"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/816387/tags","id":"816387"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rha-recovery-college","id":"rha-recovery-college","score":2},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sad","id":"sad"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/engaging","id":"engaging"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/group","id":"group"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/educational","id":"Educational"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pandemic","id":"pandemic"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/819004","id":"819004"}]},{"id":816545,"author":"mhairic","authorRoleId":4,"authorRole":"a relative","title":"The great care my dad received in Ward 24","body":"My very elderly father was admitted to Glasgow Royal Infirmary with pneumonia. He was seen in A&E and was admitted to ward 50.  \r\nFrom A&E through to the ward the medical and nursing staff kept us informed throughout about what was happening with him as we were obviously not allowed to be with him. My mum was allowed to see him that night and the next day as he was extremely ill and it was possible that he wouldn’t survive. That was handled very sensitively by the doctor who was on that night.  \r\nHe pulled through against all expectations and was transferred to Ward 24. The staff both medical and nursing were excellent at keeping us in touch with regard to his progress. Once the infection was under control he had delirium and his mobility was badly affected. The delirium made him very agitated and he was constantly looking for my mum.  \r\nThe Charge nurse assessed that for his well-being it was important that he be able to see my mum (who is very elderly herself) and allowed her and I to visit as he was in a single room and with appropriate care we could reduce the risks. This helped him enormously.  \r\nI was so impressed with the high standard of nursing care in the ward, both with regards to his physical and mental health. Knowing that he was being looked after by such professional and caring people, made what was a very difficult situation for us as a family so much easier. I cannot praise them highly enough.  \r\nMy dad was transferred to Ward 4 in Lightburn and although we haven’t been able to see him the communication has been great and his discharge is planned for next week. The OT Karen has been so helpful in helping us prepare for his arrival home. I just want to say a massive thank you to all the staff that cared for my dad in any capacity.

Our GP advised us to ring the 'call first number' at AAH. We were given an appointment for assessment at the covid rapid assessment unit. The doctor and nurses that seen to my husband at this stage were very helpful and explained everything well. We were told after a chest xray that things were bad - he had pneumonia and would need admitted for IVABs and steroids. I was grateful for the explanation, an d was scared for him as left him and went to get him an overnight bag. On arrival at A&E again, a nurse came to take his stuff and explained which antibiotics etc he was on which was great.  \r\nHowever, that is where I can honestly say the good care ended for the rest of the 48 hours he spent in A&E awaiting a bed on the ward. To cut a very long story short I feel he was treated extremely poorly. He text me to say his oxygen mask was changed but wasn't told how much oxygen he was requiring. He sent me a picture and as a nurse myself, I knew from it that things were pretty bad. The following morning he said it was changed again and again sent me a picture. You can imagine how worried I was not being able to visit and my husband not being able to give me any details. I rang for an update. I was told the nurse was busy and to ring back in half hour - fair enough. I rang back and was told this time to ring my husband for an update as they were too busy to talk to me. I find this greatly unacceptable as my husband wasn't told anything and his oxygen levels dropped every time he removed his mask. After a further hour or so of worry and anxiety, I rang and asked for a senior nurse - they answered and again told me to call my husband. I explained that he didn't know anything. I asked how much oxygen he was requiring and what was the plan. The nurse told me that they didn't know as they were in charge and not looking after him. I had to beg them to find out for me. I found this extremely unacceptable communication with a worried family member. The same thing happened the next day when I again rang for an update - I was told to ring back and then told on the 2nd call to ring my husband as the department was 'mental'. I don't feel I rang too many times - once a day i feel is acceptable (had my call been answered!)Aside from the terrible communication from staff in a&e, basic care was missing. The first full day, he wasn't given any lunch despite me being told on the 2nd phone call that he was eating lunch and was talking on the phone - lies as he couldn't speak with the mask on and couldn't manage without it. About an hour later he txt to ask me what time lunch was usually at? This is not acceptable with any patient but especially a diabetic patient. I had to inform the nurse in charge about this when talking to them so that he would be fed! I have since found out that all his meals were left on a tray on top of a bin lid at the entrance to his room. Apart from disgusting hygiene, this resulted in him having to remove his oxygen mask, make his way across the room and carry his tray back to his bed. He needed to put his mask back on for at least 5 mins prior to eating as he struggled to breathe. As I said before, he was in a&e for 48 hours and was never once offered assistance or equipment (ie a basin) to get washed or even a dish to brush his teeth. This I believe is very basic nursing care and in my opinion on this occasion it was extremely poor / absent. I understand that we are in the middle of a pandemic and the NHS is really struggling (i work in the thick of it too!) but the lack of such basic care such as providing food and hygiene is a disgrace.  \r\nThank goodness my husband eventually got transferred to a ward (A3) where his care and the communication from staff was excellent. I only needed to ring the ward once during his stay - on the evening he got admitted. The nurse who was looking after him was busy with their patients but the nurse who answered the phone got all the information needed and provided me with a comprehensive update on his care and the plan. My husband was also very well informed of what was happening and was therefore able to update me the rest of the time until discharge. Once on the ward he started to recover fairly quickly. He was well fed and given assistance as and when he required. A massive thank you to the staff on the ward for their diligent care and attention given to my husband. They made the end of his hospital journey much more pleasant than the start of it.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-01-14T18:30:14.1366667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-01-15T11:39:54.037","readBy":[{"name":"Northern Health and Social Care Trust","count":12},{"name":"Public Health Agency","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/816560","id":"816560"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/816560/responses","id":"816560"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/816560/healthservices","id":"816560"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/816560/tags","id":"816560"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt002_24027-pf","id":"ZT002_24027-pf","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt002-aah-a3-medical-respiratory","id":"zt002-aah-a3-medical-respiratory","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scared","id":"scared"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/worried","id":"worried"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication%20on%20ward","id":"Communication on ward"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helpful","id":"helpful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/informative","id":"informative"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kept%20informed","id":"kept informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attitude","id":"staff attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/terrible","id":"terrible"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/family%20kept%20informed","id":"family kept informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/explanations","id":"explanations"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/access%20to%20food","id":"access to food"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/817802","id":"817802"}]},{"id":816678,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Great experience ","body":"I attended Severn View Practice for my first Covid Vaccination.

I was not expecting this appointment to come through for months and was quite surprise it was going ahead, especially as we are still living with Covid and the restrictions. As the procedure was necessary and would be worse if delayed, I accepted the appointment.  \r\nFrom that stage on, we could not have been in better hands. The pre-operative assessment was undertaken over the phone by Jane, one of the nurses in the ward. As my son has additional needs was followed up by a further call which went into detail about him and what would help with his experience. Jane was very understanding and not at all judgemental. I felt far more confident in taking my son for the procedure. The call was followed up by a postal pack which would allow my son to take a virtual tour and step by step guide of what would happen to him in hospital. He did not want to watch this but I wish that I had insisted.  \r\nMy son was given a Covid test 3 days before the operation. This was simple, quick and easy to access. The results were sent to my mobile phone, reassuring me that he was clear and therefore able to turn up for his appointment on the Monday. We followed all of the guidance in the letters received regarding not eating and prepared a bag with books, a DVD and other essentials. As my son is a little fussy when it comes to food and I understood that he would need to eat before going home, I prepared some snacks I knew he would like. I also made sure to take plenty for myself.  \r\nOn arrival we were greeted in such a warm and friendly way despite the masks, sanitising and distancing. My son was given his own room, which I think was part of the reasonable adjustments the hospital had made for him due to his additional needs. This was very welcome as it helped to keep him calm. The team had also provided a Lego set for him to build. Such a lovely touch as he went straight into building it and chatting to Jane. Measurements and observations were undertaken. Each team member involved was equally friendly, approachable and were happy to explain what they were doing and talk about subjects that interested my son and kept him calm.  \r\nWhen the surgeon came to assess the area that needed operating on, we discussed if it was an essential procedure. Due to the pre-operation consultations being over the phone, it has not been possible for this to be done in person. There was some discussion about the fact that the condition could improve and that the surgeon would understand if we wanted to wait a year. He assured us that this was not going to be a problem and that it had been known to happen. He said he would give us time and return after he had done his first operation of the day. My son and I had plenty of time to discuss the situation and then we were joined by Jane, who encouraged my son's view to be heard. He was clear that he would go ahead and that is the course we took. It was so good to have assistance in hearing his views and know that they were taken seriously by the team. When the surgeon returned, we let him know that we would go ahead.  \r\nUnfortunately when it came to my son going into the room where his aesthetic was to be given, he completely panicked. He would not allow either the mask or the needle near him. The team were calm and patient. They talked to him without pressure or fuss. When it was apparent that he would not comply they moved him back to his room and changed their list. We were then visited again by the nurse and she persuaded him to take a pre-med. She was honest and clear and talked to my son in a direct way. She was also encouraging and supportive.  \r\nThe anaesthetists came into my son's room and fitted the device into the back of his hand. He was much more settled with this being done in his room. When they took him into the room which he was to go under in, he became anxious again but went under quickly and I was given reassurance and a time to expect him back. Once in recovery and showing signs of waking, I was called and allowed to sit with him. Again there were two nurses in attendance and they were really pleasant and kind. Once he was fully awake, we returned to his room and he was gently allowed to come around and wake. Many of those involved in his whole procedure came to see how he was doing, his observations were done and the site of the procedure checked.  \r\nOnce he had eaten and was ready to be discharged, I was given all of the creams and ointments I needed along with instructions both verbally and in writing of how to care for him at home. My son was taken in a wheelchair and assisted into the car at the front of the hospital and we took him home. He was glad to have gone through with the operation with the help of the loving, caring, patent work of a whole team of people who we cannot thank enough.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-01-13T12:05:33.6166667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-01-15T14:10:16.26","readBy":[{"name":"Royal Devon University Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust","count":3}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/816157","id":"816157"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/816157/responses","id":"816157"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/816157/healthservices","id":"816157"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/816157/tags","id":"816157"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rbz12_100","id":"RBZ12_100","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rbz12_300","id":"RBZ12_300","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxious","id":"anxious"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/approachable","id":"approachable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/encouraging","id":"encouraging"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good","id":"good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hearing","id":"hearing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/honest","id":"honest"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kindness","id":"kindness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/non%20judgemental","id":"non judgemental"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/quick","id":"quick"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassurance","id":"reassurance"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/signs","id":"signs"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/simple","id":"simple"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supportive","id":"supportive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/warm","id":"warm"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/calm","id":"calm"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confident","id":"confident"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happy","id":"happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/patience","id":"patience"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/involved%20in%20decisions","id":"involved in decisions"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/817994","id":"817994"}]},{"id":814946,"author":"Maeve","authorRoleId":6,"authorRole":"a staff member","title":"Contact during Covid","body":"My father-in-law is in Kettering General Hospital. I know the staff are under tremendous pressure, even from the fact that family members cannot visit and so are reliant on numerous phonecalls to the already busy wards.  \r\nKettering General have a system in place that allows you to email a central address with the patient’s name and ward identified, and they will deliver the email to the patient. I assume that in the instance that the person can’t read the email, the staff will assist. This allows someone that is physically unable to access their own phone to receive almost instant messages of support and in the situation with my family, where we live in Ireland, it has really helped us to communicate.  \r\nMaybe this system exists elsewhere, but thankfully I’ve not had to engage with the hospital other than to work there! If it doesn’t exist in other hospitals, I highly recommend it.  \r\nMany thanks to Kettering General from all of our family.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-01-07T15:46:08.0633333","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2021-01-15T14:15:27.043","readBy":[{"name":"Kettering General Hospital NHS Foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/814946","id":"814946"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/814946/responses","id":"814946"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/814946/healthservices","id":"814946"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/814946/tags","id":"814946"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rnq51_300","id":"RNQ51_300","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helpful","id":"helpful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/use%20of%20technology","id":"use of technology"}]},{"id":816215,"author":"Andypn","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Lack of awareness of ASD and GDD","body":"We had contacted our GP surgery seeking to be put on the register as carers.

I advised her I knew that as did my GP who sent me to ED following a discussion with a Dr at NHSFV.  \r\nThe nurse then stated that’s I should tell the Dr exactly what I told them and take a seat outside and wait on the Dr implying it could be a while despite there being only 2 other people in ED.

They got the wrong staff mixed up and seemed like my daughter was not on the list of appointments or that they had forgot. During the appointment my daughter said she felt belittled and mocked by the nurse. Saying some awful comments to her. With no understanding or regard of her autistic difficulties.  \r\nDuring crisis team phone calls my daughter is told someone will ring back but never do. We have to constantly chase up calls to get support or appointments. This week we went for her weekly appointment with her caseworker. Only to be left waiting 25mins for the nurse to come and tell us the caseworker was off ill. Apparently the caseworker was told to contact us but I did not receive any information on this. The nurse claimed the caseworker had tried to ring but I must of been on another call?! I stated that I had not been on my phone that day! The nurse was condescending and patronising in tone and asking my daughter if she wanted to make a complaint and to go and enjoy the sunshine! This wasted journey could of been prevented. We felt neglected and frustrated. Still no correspondence from the caseworker or any rescheduling of an appointment!Today was my daughters choice appointment with the doctor so my daughter can access community CAMHS which was a video appointment that we had waited a month for! We were waiting for 30mins in the Microsoft Teams meeting and no answer. I rang CAMHS and the receptionist said she’s emailing the doctor and should hear something soon. Again we feel neglected, upset and unable to get any sufficient support.

It took me a few Opticians/Doctors appointments form to be referred as when I had gone to the appointments - it was said that they were unsure what to put on the referral as they could not see any evidence of my eye going inwards and no physical need to be referred for specialists opinion. This made me feel not heard, not believed and like I was over-exaggerating or worse, making it up.  \r\nFinally I got referred and My consultant was Mr. Kostakis at DRI. When I met with Mr. Kostakis, I immediately felt listened to and reassured. Mr. Kostakis took his time with the appointments I had and was able to give full explanation to what I was experiencing. Mr Kostakis impression/diagnosis was that I had a Convergence Spasm which is rare - I felt relief that he knew what my issue was straight away, he had a good knowledge of the research and was able to start an evidence-based treatment plan from my first visit. Mr. Kostakis kept me thoroughly informed throughout my treatment. Mr. Kostakis would explain and give me options of what the next steps would be and he gave me choice and it was shared decision making which is something I find really beneficial in healthcare. Mr. Kostakis would take a holistic approach to my care and treatment and always put me at ease in appointments. From being in the waiting room and observing Mr. Kostakis with his younger patients his \"bedside\" manner was amazing, engaging and absolutely professional.  \r\nOverall, my experience was the best that it could have been and if I ever needed any more intervention regarding my eye - I know I would be in safe, knowledgeable and compassionate hands. Thank you Mr. Kostakis!","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-01-14T15:12:47.8566667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-01-15T15:34:53.37","readBy":[{"name":"Doncaster and Bassetlaw Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/816486","id":"816486"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/816486/responses","id":"816486"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/816486/healthservices","id":"816486"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/816486/tags","id":"816486"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rp5dr_130","id":"RP5DR_130","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/accommodation","id":"accommodation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diagnosis","id":"diagnosis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/efficient","id":"efficient"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/explanation","id":"explanation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/eye","id":"eye"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good","id":"good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kept%20informed","id":"kept informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/knowledgeable","id":"knowledgeable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/manner","id":"manner"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/opthalmology","id":"opthalmology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professionalism","id":"professionalism"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing","id":"amazing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassionate","id":"compassionate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/relieved","id":"relieved"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20ease","id":"at ease"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/involved%20in%20decisions","id":"involved in decisions"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/autonomy","id":"autonomy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/listened%20to","id":"listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/convergence%20spasm","id":"convergence spasm"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/835613","id":"835613"}]},{"id":816535,"author":"Maisiemoo1","authorRoleId":11,"authorRole":"other","title":"Getting a place","body":"I was homeless with my dog and the nurse called sue helped me find somewhere for me and my dog and I can't thank her enough for helping me out","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-01-14T17:24:59.7666667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-01-15T15:35:17.753","readBy":[{"name":"Change Grow Live","count":5}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/816535","id":"816535"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/816535/responses","id":"816535"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/816535/healthservices","id":"816535"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/816535/tags","id":"816535"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/nms-halton-integrated-recovery-service","id":"nms-halton-integrated-recovery-service","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/help","id":"help"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/817307","id":"817307"}]},{"id":816543,"author":"octoberrh77","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Inpatient Care on Ward 210","body":"I was referred to the gynae department at the Royal Infirmary at the end of October because of a mass on one ovary.

I didn't feel anyone was listening and I was very rude but I just didn't know what to do, I'd start phoning 5 minutes before 9am and the answer phone was still on until they answered around 9.20am and it was the same thing at 2pm.

In the past and all through this pandemic I've not bothered the surgery and not phoned when maybe I should have but knew there was probably in more need than myself, but this time I did just need 2 minutes and lost it, sorry again for my behaviour. 9.5 out of 10 and the viruses fault that its not 10 out of 10 ","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2021-01-14T19:24:50","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-01-15T15:43:21","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/816720","id":"816720"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/816720/responses","id":"816720"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/816720/healthservices","id":"816720"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/816720/tags","id":"816720"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/c85003","id":"C85003","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frustrated","id":"frustrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scared","id":"scared"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/terrified","id":"terrified"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20frustrated","id":"very frustrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breathing","id":"breathing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/chest","id":"chest"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/chest%20infection","id":"chest infection"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/infection","id":"infection"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/inhaler","id":"inhaler"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/818324","id":"818324"}]},{"id":816719,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Covid vaccine attendance","body":"I was invited to the practice as an NHS staff member on a last minute vaccine place.\nVery impressed with the whole process of the way the clinic was organised from start to finish.\n\n\n","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2021-01-14T19:26:11","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-01-15T15:44:23","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/816719","id":"816719"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/816719/responses","id":"816719"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/816719/healthservices","id":"816719"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/816719/tags","id":"816719"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l81018","id":"L81018","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/impressed","id":"impressed"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/817179","id":"817179"}]},{"id":816718,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Superb service","body":"Hi, I had reason to enquire about a medical condition to help with a family issue that is being supported via a specialist geneticist.

The Admin team regularly get things wrong, either they misscommunicate or fail to pass on messages to Medical colleagues and managers. One or two are rather abrupt to patients and trying to get through on the phones (which currently is the ONLY way as the App is worse than useless and the information on it is rarely up to date) and you are left in a phone queue for up to 45 mins when you call for any reason at any time of day. If you are 'lucky' enough to get through and secure a telephone consultation with a doctor it rarely happens when scheduled. It does waste everyone's time if you book a telephone consulation timeslot and a doctor calls you earlier than your appointment (2 hours earlier on one occassion!) which you then miss because you are not expecting it as you may be working yourself, then they don't call again even at the scheduled time! When you do speak to a Doctor who then prescribes you medication, its pot luck if you ever actually get it. Too often the scripts are either not forwarded via the Admin team to the 'Correct' pharmacy or are for the wrong drug entirely! Recently we waited 2.5 months for a medication to arrive only to discover the prescription had been sent to a Medical equipment provider not the patients nominated Pharmacy! Currently we have waited 2 weeks for an urgent medication that should have been dispensed for home delivery from our pharmacy within 48 hours, and we are still waiting for it now into week 3!! Appalling.  \nDoctors are all very nice but sadly let down by the admin team, they are also getting medications wrong and it has taken 3 attempts to correct another drug for one of our family members, resulting in an interuption in their medical supply and this causes them other issues. They are also not following up on referrals made, meaning the patient is having to chase everything up themself, this is not good, the patients are the ill poeple and should not have to do this! Unfortuantely the list of issues is getting longer.\nSadly things were not much better before the pandemic with the Admin team but the Doctors were better, because then you could sit in a surgery and observe them process the necessary referrals and check the prescription requests. Now it is sheer luck if you get what you require as everything has to go through an appallingly disorganised Admin team, too many of whom are simply are not up to the job or simply don't care. \nQuestion \"What if I train my staff and they leave?\"..... \nAnswer \" But what of you don't and they stay?\"","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2021-01-14T20:06:27","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-01-15T16:03:14","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/816734","id":"816734"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/816734/responses","id":"816734"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/816734/healthservices","id":"816734"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/816734/tags","id":"816734"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/m85058","id":"M85058","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appalling","id":"appalling"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/delivery","id":"delivery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/drug","id":"drug"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good","id":"good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lucky","id":"lucky"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pharmacy","id":"Pharmacy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/816958","id":"816958"}]},{"id":816733,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Complicated ","body":"I rang this morning to be told there are a few appointments with my doctor for tomorrow morning but I will have to ring back at 2 pm which I did and after finally getting through again was told exactly the same but ring again in the morning which will mean another 25 minutes trying to get through.

I was guided through the building by the marshals, checks were undertaken and information given. When I received the jab it was in an environment of calm, questions were asked, checks were made and I was given the opportunity to discuss any concerns. The injection was painless and then I was guided to a waiting area to sit for 15 minutes being observed by staff in case I felt unwell. Then when I was ready to leave I checked out with the nurse at the exit, just one more question to ensure that I felt well before going home. I am an NHS worker but non the less I feel lucky to have received the vaccine and to be cared for in such an efficint and caring environment.

I have been there since 1985. June 2018, I was very ill and suicidal and was treated badly, doctor on my emergency appointment argued semantics as to whether I had suicidal thoughts or was suicidal and didn't get me any help. Luckily, a private sector psychologist gave me an emergency appointment and then kept me on and saved me. Roll forward to March 2020 and I had a \"don't darken our doorstep\" type of text at the start of Covid. I complied despite severe foot inflammation in October and December 2020. I felt the practice wouldn't care as I hadn't had a follow up text saying how to get help. I had a flu injection invite in December which I declined as they're not good for my conditions and got a bossy NHS letter 8Jan almost telling me it was my national duty to have one.

I felt at ease when I was speaking with her as I was a bit anxious about the procedure I was having and she explained things fully to me. She also understood about endometriosis which is the condition that I have and was knowledgable on it which made such a difference because the last few months have been so bad due to symptoms getting worse. It may seem like nothing to some people but her kindness and understanding really helped especially at quite a stressful time.

Before I had the panic attack I could never have understood what people meant about anxiety and didn't believe I was the sort of person who would ever suffer from something like that.  \r\nI was contacted by a lady from the Bereavement Team and felt able to talk openly and freely about how I was feeling. I'm not normally the sort of person who opens up to strangers easily and I do have friends and family that have tried to do everything they can but there are things that I felt more comfortable saying to a stranger.  \r\nThe lady who rang me was amazing - non judgemental, supportive and caring - she called me regularly and listened to me and let me cry. She gave me links and resources to different places to learn about some coping mechanisms that might work for me and most importantly was able to give me the information I needed to access some specialist counselling.  \r\nMy head was such a mess after my Dad died - without this service I truly believe I would still be in a mess as I didn't have the motivation or clear headedness to think properly for a while. I had slipped into a routine of withdrawing from people around me and drinking too much to get to sleep.  \r\nHaving the comfort of knowing that there was someone there checking up on you, making sure you're OK and checking that plans are being followed up and helping access formal counselling was invaluable to me.  \r\nIt must be a hard job to listen to people in my situation or worse and still be able to maintain such a caring persona.  \r\nThank you to this support worker and everyone else at the Bereavement Team. In my opinion your services are invaluable.  \r\nThough I hope I don't need to access anything like this anytime soon and I hope that no-one I know does either, if it is needed this service would be the first I recommend.  \r\nYou put me on the right track to be able to deal with my loss in as best way as I can.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-01-15T15:01:24.2833333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-01-15T16:53:03.66","readBy":[{"name":"Six Degrees Social Enterprise","count":7}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/816700","id":"816700"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/816700/responses","id":"816700"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/816700/healthservices","id":"816700"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/816700/tags","id":"816700"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/six-degrees-gmbs","id":"six-degrees-gmbs","score":null},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/817334","id":"817334"}]},{"id":816756,"author":"Happy volunteer","authorRoleId":10,"authorRole":"a volunteer/advocate","title":"Friday meditation group","body":"All week I look forward to Amanda’s meditation group, it always makes me feel so uplifted and ready for the week ahead.

One constant has been the high quality of attention and service by the nursing team, excellent.  \r\nThe current set-up of a dedicated venesection consultation room at Forth Valley Royal run by nurse Cathy is exceptional. This set up is marvellous and most efficient, and a credit to whoever thought of a dedicated venesection department. Even more credit to management for supporting it!  \r\nAppointment wait time is around 3-4 weeks, which is excellent in itself, but the real plus is that the are seldom any delays to the actual appointment time on the day. Separating out venesections from Day Medicine avoids delays on the day. These delays often resulted in me waiting over an hour whereas now I seldom wait at all and if I do, it is only 5 minutes or so.

From the moment I arrived in labour at the Triage Ward to when we were discharged from the Fern Ward 5 days later I cannot fault the care I received.  \r\nMy birth experience at the Bracken Centre was more than I could have hoped for. I was lucky enough to give birth at this fantastic facility and to have two outstanding midwives take care of me during the course of my labour - Pollyanna and Elenor.  \r\nThey were absolute superstars in encouraging me and making me feel confident and safe.  \r\nUnfortunately my baby and I both went on to have a few complications after the birth which resulted in our extended stay.  \r\nEvery single member of staff went above and beyond to make us comfortable.  \r\nI felt well informed and in the safest hands for the care we both needed.  \r\nUnfortunately a week after being discharged our little boy was having some breathing issues. We took him to the A&E department where we were seen immediately by a team of fantastic nurses and doctors.  \r\nWe were placed in a quiet side room from the time of our arrival and I felt reassured with all the Covid safely measures they had in place.  \r\nWe were then admitted to Acorn ward for some further tests and observations. The kindness and the positivity we got from the wonderful team of doctors and nurses here was fabulous.  \r\nOur stay was unfortunately longer than we had hoped for but only because the doctors left no stone unturned when looking into the issues our baby was having.  \r\nFor a hospital under so much pressure with the current situation we received outstanding care.  \r\nThis is a team of hard working, fantastic medical staff who are a credit to the NHS.  \r\nIn the nicest possible way I hope we are not required to go back anytime soon - but I know if we do the treatment and care we will receive will be first class.  \r\nThank you Musgrove, you are all amazing!","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-01-15T09:12:47.7433333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-01-15T17:05:35.9","readBy":[{"name":"Somerset NHS Foundation Trust","count":6}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/816658","id":"816658"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/816658/responses","id":"816658"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/816658/healthservices","id":"816658"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/816658/tags","id":"816658"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rh5a8-501","id":"RH5A8-501","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/above%20and%20beyond","id":"above and beyond"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/birth","id":"birth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/caring","id":"caring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/echo","id":"echo"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/encouraging","id":"encouraging"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/first%20class%20care","id":"first class care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hard%20working","id":"hard working"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kept%20informed","id":"kept informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kindness","id":"kindness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/labour","id":"labour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lucky","id":"lucky"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lumbar%20puncture","id":"lumbar puncture"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/midwives","id":"midwives"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/safe","id":"safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/xray","id":"Xray"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing","id":"amazing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confident","id":"confident"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fantastic","id":"fantastic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hope","id":"Hope"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/positivity","id":"Positivity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%20test","id":"covid test"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/819001","id":"819001"}]},{"id":816681,"author":"Juney66","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"the service received as an inpatient","body":"Having been admitted to the Royal Alexandra Hospital (Paisley) in December, I have to say ward 4 staff were absolutely on the ball, the nursing staff were very professional yet friendly, catering and cleaning staff were spot on too.

I can't praise the staff in the endoscopy unit at pilgrim hospital enough and the nurse from Grantham hospital.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-01-15T14:15:20.7","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2021-01-15T17:10:50.773","readBy":[{"name":"United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/816695","id":"816695"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/816695/responses","id":"816695"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/816695/healthservices","id":"816695"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/816695/tags","id":"816695"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rwdla_301","id":"RWDLA_301","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20about","id":"Cared about"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ercp","id":"ERCP"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kept%20informed","id":"kept informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professionalism","id":"professionalism"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/safe","id":"safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20for","id":"cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"}]},{"id":816770,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"A caring team of doctors","body":"My experience has been really positive, with each GP being consistently committed to providing high quality diagnosis and care.

For my autistic teenage son, yesterday our new GP did exactly that!  For the first time as a parent carer I felt that I did not have to ‘translate’ for my autistic son.  This was all down to the exceptional communication, friendly, incredibly kind and understanding manor of our new GP.  I have never seen my son speak so comfortably, honestly and calmly about his difficulties with a GP or an adult he has never met before.  This is so important for a GP to be able to have this understanding and these skills as my sons health may well have deteriorated over another year had he have not met with this GP.  Due to his natural and confident way of communicating effectively with my son I believe that my son will feel far more at ease when wanting to discuss anything medical in the future.
