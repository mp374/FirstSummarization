On a regular basis his tonsils swell up so much that they even touch is uvula. In fact he is experiencing this right now.  \r\nAfter repeated visits to the GP they decided to refer him to NHS Forth Valley ENT. We attended an appointment with Consultant A who asked us to undertake a sleep study, which we did. The study came back okay. We attended a second appointment with Consultant A who, on examination, decided that my son should have is tonsils and adenoids removed and have gromits placed for glue ear. He was placed on a waiting list as an urgent case. We waited. The COVID-19 pandemic hit and all procedures were cancelled. We waited more. Eventually we were told he had a date for his operation. We attended the hospital a couple more times for pre-op and for him to have a COVID-19 test.  \r\nEventually, hours before we were due to attend the hospital for the operation we were informed that Consultant B (who had never met my son before) had cancelled the operation. Why, we asked, they weren't entirely sure - it turned out that it was because they do not generally operate on kids under three. How was this not caught by the myriad of people we spoke to? Every time we attended we were asked his DoB. And why did Consultant B think they could over-rule the decision Consultant A had made?  \r\nWe waited some more. Eventually we were asked to come and see Consultant B to discuss my son's situation. We arrived. Consultant B appeared not to have read anything about my son. They didn't even know that a sleep study had been done. They appeared quite dismissive of Consultant A and informed us it had been \"wrong\" to schedule the procedure let alone as an urgent case. Consultant B believed the risks outweighed the benefits. I asked if they were aware how much pain this caused my son and would continue to do if nothing was done and was told \"this is how I want to manage this\". Consultant B told us they wanted to schedule a hearing test and that was the last we heard. Nothing has been done since.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-11-03T12:13:23.27","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-11-05T12:52:32.283","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Forth Valley","count":7}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/800748","id":"800748"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/800748/responses","id":"800748"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/800748/healthservices","id":"800748"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/800748/tags","id":"800748"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/forth-valley-royal-ent","id":"forth-valley-royal-ent","score":2},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/adenoids","id":"adenoids"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cancelled%20operation","id":"cancelled operation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20believed","id":"not believed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tonsillitis","id":"tonsillitis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tonsils","id":"tonsils"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reading%20notes","id":"reading notes"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/conflicting%20information","id":"conflicting information"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%20test","id":"covid test"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/803663","id":"803663"}]},{"id":800780,"author":"Ajaxpc","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Where to source batteries and tubes","body":"I can't contact the service.  \r\nI feel a bit mystified, and uncertain about where to source batteries and tubes ...","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-11-03T13:22:54.52","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-11-05T12:56:26.793","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Grampian","count":6}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/800780","id":"800780"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/800780/responses","id":"800780"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/800780/healthservices","id":"800780"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/800780/tags","id":"800780"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/n102h-audio","id":"n102h-audio","score":0},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/abandoned","id":"abandoned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/audiology","id":"audiology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/information","id":"information"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tubes","id":"tubes"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/contactable","id":"contactable"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/801304","id":"801304"}]},{"id":800785,"author":"EHWN","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Flu' Vaccination","body":"I am 76 and was treated for cancer all last year (2019).

She questioned and examined me very thoroughly and was very patient. She then consulted with Dr Coppell, her superior, who re-examined me and confirmed their suspicions that I may be suffering from low grade Lymphoma.  \r\nThey then discussed with me in detail the following steps needed to determine my diagnosis and options for further treatment. Following this consultation I was sent a very prompt appointment for a scan where again the staff were very kind and helpful.  \r\nFour days later one of the nurses from the Seamoor Unit, Pippa, rang me at home to say that I needed to have a biopsy, this was arranged very quickly. During my biopsy I was treated by Sandra, the radiologist, and her nurse Debs who again put me at my ease and I could not have wished for better treatment.  \r\nThe following week I visited the Seamoor unit where I was seen by Dr Lufti and Nurse Bowyer.

My husband had to drive me to Shaftesbury twice before I had to be very firm last Monday to make an appointment to see a nurse, which I did on Tuesday. The person who answered the telephone told me the surgery was very busy.  In fact when I attended for my appointment on Tuesday 3rd November  at 3.45 pm the yellow room was empty.  The nurse was absolutely brilliant and this is what stops me from changing to another practice.  The doctors and nurses who are first class.  However it seems that receptionists are instructed to turn away patients.  I don't like the system of, having overcome the first hurdle, having to wait for doctors to ring you back.  This makes it extremely difficult for working people to make appointments.  In all the merger has had a very negative effect on the excellent service I had from Wootton Grove Practice.

This being our daughters first admission and being a 4 hour drive away from home we had so many reservations ,also with all the restrictions due to local lockdown we had no clue how our daughters treatment would look and how visitation would work. I cannot praise highly enough the professionalism of all the staff on Orchard Ward. At first I drove the poor Nursing/HCA staff mad with constant calls and emails but every single member of staff were kind and understanding and would patiently explain everything to me. Yes the ward has rules, they have to protect and keep the adolescents safe, this includes the non use of camera phones ( I don't know about anyone else but I don't want my daughters face on social media whilst in hospital) so yes my daughter didn't have her phone for a week until we took her a brick phone. In the interim she had a detox from social media and the internet which I personally believe is fantastic. If we want to speak on the phone there is a patient phone that the adolescent can use or we can use to call her. She was admitted to heal and receive specialist help and support and has received exactly that. My daughter has accessed her education a talking therapist and music therapy which she has found invaluable. If you want to see what treatment is like from Nurses whom work for pay only and an extremely stretched CAMHS then come to London. I have had to fight like a lion to get just the smallest of help and support here in London with mental health nurses whom come to work for pay only and not in your child's best interest. To witness and receive the care we have from Orchard Ward has been refreshing and a huge relief. I want to say a HUGE thank you to every single member of the team on Orchard ward, from the amazing family therapist whom gave me space and  supported me through a very tough time to the HCA's whom have been with my daughter as a 121 for a period of time and have been kind, helpful and lovely giving my daughter the support that she needed being away from everyone she loves and cares for. To the Nurses whom have communicated so well the care my daughter has been receiving and answering all my many questions with patience and understanding and just loveliness. To the management team on the ward whom have been so wonderful helping us with visits and replying to all of my queries. Finally to her Doctor whom has shown compassion and kindness, communicating with me with regards to treatment and answering all of my concerns and worries. Compassionate, kind, patient, empathetic, lovely.. I know I repeat the words but these staff members deserve this praise and more. Working under these circumstances cannot be easy but from our experience we see a team of staff whom have pulled together to work for the best outcome of our daughter and we cannot thank you all enough.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-11-05T11:40:37","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-11-05T14:19:58","readBy":[{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2020)","count":2}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/801288","id":"801288"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/801288/responses","id":"801288"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/801288/healthservices","id":"801288"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/801288/tags","id":"801288"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/ntn23","id":"NTN23","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxious","id":"anxious"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/camera","id":"camera"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/camhs","id":"camhs"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/detox","id":"detox"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/face","id":"face"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/safe","id":"safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing","id":"amazing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fantastic","id":"fantastic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported","id":"supported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wonderful","id":"wonderful"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/802966","id":"802966"}]},{"id":801285,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Coronavirus ","body":"My husband is due for surgery next week , and we have to have a covid test 2 days prior .

I was unable to express my feelings nor did I think I was capable of feeling anything since I felt empty inside.  \r\nSomeone close to me suggested I refer myself to therapy but I was hesitant because it‚Äôs frowned upon in my ‚Äòculture‚Äô. Anyway, because of my anxiety, I missed my first appointment and didn‚Äôt feel comfortable talking to a stranger. I felt bad about myself to I rebooked it so in order for me to improve myself.  \r\nMy therapist, Rashmeet, called me and introduced herself and I felt comfortable starting therapy with her. We spent the first few sessions discussing how I was feeling and how these problems came to be. The following sessions were about methods of self improvement and with each session, I practised what I was taught in my daily life from challenging negative thoughts to speaking publicly without stuttering as it was affecting my work and home life in a negative manner before.  \r\nI gradually started to use the strategies that I was taught more and more so now I‚Äôm able to use them whenever I feel down or having negative thoughts. In the end, going through therapy with Rashmeet was the smartest thing I‚Äôve ever done.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-11-03T14:24:19.9133333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-11-05T15:44:13.383","readBy":[{"name":"Sheffield University Medical School 2020","count":1},{"name":"West London NHS Trust","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/800794","id":"800794"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/800794/responses","id":"800794"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/800794/healthservices","id":"800794"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/800794/tags","id":"800794"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rkl07-hounslow-iapt","id":"RKL07-hounslow-iapt","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazed","id":"amazed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/content","id":"content"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/depressed","id":"depressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/in%20control","id":"in control"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/life%20changing","id":"life changing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/longer%20service","id":"longer service"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reliable","id":"reliable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/therapist","id":"therapist"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/understanding","id":"understanding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happy","id":"happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hopeful","id":"hopeful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/relieved","id":"relieved"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thankful","id":"Thankful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20tools","id":"given tools"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stress%20relief","id":"stress relief"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/844304","id":"844304"}]},{"id":800802,"author":"everial b","authorRoleId":3,"authorRole":"a parent/guardian","title":"Sons struggles","body":"Son referred by school and GP to community paediatrics in 2019 who have been amazing and very supportive, son put on AAP 18 months ago, also done sensory workshop up in leven was really good, and attended OT at Queen Margaret, all great.  \r\nI am not happy with waiting times in fife for assessments to be done, son still hasn't even been triaged yet, before covid pandemic even started waiting times were ridiculous, from a parents point of view feel like im sitting in a dark tunnel with no light or answers to any questions, its so frustrating not knowing what is going on or how long the waits for assessments are.

Modern Day Heroes in our opinion.  \r\nEach and every person we came to encounter during my Mother‚Äôs Hospital Stay was so comforting, staff where so accommodating and nothing was too much bother.

The long process of recovery then started.  \r\nI was told by hospital staff that I'd been referred to NAHSCP (Integrated Care Team) to look after me in the home setting. The day after my discharge from hospital I was visited by members of the North Ayrshire Integrated Care Team, who co-ordinated my recovery. Throughout the period after my discharge I was expertly cared for by a wonderful team of professional Health Care Staff. From Doctor Harvey, Physiotherapist, Occupational Therapist, Dietician, Speech and Language Therapist and Nursing Staff. (sorry if Ive missed anyone out)  \r\nEach of the team made expert co-ordinated visits, either in person of virtually, to deliver what can only be described as the best care package. For someone who could barely walk the length of myself, I was coached back to walking, with the aid of a wheelchair, then walking frame, then walking stick. The support provided allowed me to recover to the place where I'm practically in a position to consider a return to work, in the future.  \r\nWithout the support provided, I would still be struggling, even after this period of time.  \r\nNo words can be said to thank the team for the dedicated support delivered, but simply said, A VERY BIG THANK YOU to all involved.  \r\nThis co-ordinated approach could easily be replicated by other Health and Social Care Partnership in the greater Ayrshire areas, and I would suggest that with a little thought, this service could easily be delivered by both East and South Ayrshire HSCP's.  \r\nWell Done North Ayrshire HSCP.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-11-04T11:52:12.9666667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-11-05T17:29:47.587","readBy":[{"name":"North Ayrshire Health & Social Care Partnership","count":4},{"name":"Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists (RCSLT)","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/801046","id":"801046"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/801046/responses","id":"801046"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/801046/healthservices","id":"801046"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/801046/tags","id":"801046"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/nahscp-community","id":"nahscp-community","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/brilliant%20staff","id":"brilliant staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/coordination","id":"coordination"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dietician","id":"Dietician"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/excellent","id":"excellent"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/expertise","id":"expertise"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/speech%20and%20language","id":"Speech and Language"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/team","id":"team"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/walking","id":"walking"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/walking%20aid","id":"walking aid"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wheelchair","id":"wheelchair"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gp%20services","id":"gp services"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid","id":"covid"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid-19%20recovery","id":"covid-19 recovery"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/804266","id":"804266"}]}]
