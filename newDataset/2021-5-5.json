The wait time in a&e was only 20 mins, staff saw my suffering, I was in a hospital bed with no more pain within 40 mins, x-rayed, scanned and diagnosed by 0900 hours that same morning.  \r\nFantastic.  \r\nThese staff and doctor of urology at around 1300 hours inserted 1 x stent into each of my ureters where these stones were located, this was again a great relief as it allowed my body to function as it should.  \r\nUrology doctor tells me their plan of action: to arrange a time with me to return to get these kidney stones out, they will examine the stones once removed in an attempt to find what food they are formed from, that way I can adjust my diet. I do not want a repeat of these kidney stones forming inside my body... no more pain!  \r\nThanks NHS.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-05-02T06:41:24.85","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-05-05T05:54:17.927","readBy":[{"name":"Surrey and Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust","count":10}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/842916","id":"842916"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/842916/responses","id":"842916"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/842916/healthservices","id":"842916"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/842916/tags","id":"842916"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rtp04_101","id":"RTP04_101","score":4},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diet","id":"diet"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/efficiency","id":"efficiency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/great","id":"great"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/in%20control","id":"in control"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kept%20informed","id":"kept informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kidney","id":"kidney"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/quality","id":"quality"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stent","id":"stent"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/the%20food","id":"the food"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/urology%20team","id":"urology team"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/able%20to%20cope","id":"able to cope"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thanks","id":"thanks"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kidney%20stones","id":"kidney stones"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/844270","id":"844270"}]},{"id":842929,"author":"Debbie48","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Well organised for getting vaccine","body":"All the staff were amazing from the car park to getting checked in to getting my vaccine.  \r\nEverything is so well organised and everyone makes you feel calm and relaxed.

I had had post menopausal bleeding and a scan showing the endometrial lining was slightly thicker than it should be.  \r\nI drove to the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff on my own - this was late summer 2020 so because of Covid there was very little interaction before or during the procedure.  \r\nThe doctor and nurse were polite but nothing prepared me for the pain I felt. At no time did anyone discuss whether this could be done under a general anaesthetic or offer a general anaesthetic following the scan I had. I had had painful experiences including a fainting episode during IUD insertion and removal many years previously but no one asked me about this. Apparently if they had, or if I had mentioned the problems I experienced having a routine cervical smear then a general anaesthetic may have been considered. Although I acknowledge that I am a higher anaesthetic risk because of my high BMI.  \r\nThey started the procedure and it was obvious to them that I was in pain so the nurse handed me gas and air and explained how to use it. The pain was already quite bad with the scope inserted, and it felt as if there was air or water being pushed in, I don't know which but it became more and more painful.  \r\nThe doctor said they needed to take a biopsy, this was excruciatingly painful and the gas and air did not really do anything to alleviate the pain other than make me feel very lightheaded. They wanted to take a bigger biopsy as the doctor said they were not sure they had managed to get a big enough sample but had to stop because of the pain.  \r\nI think they wanted me to say to carry on but there was no way I was going to voluntarily go through that pain again. I have had pylonephritis in the past and this was much worse.  \r\nThe results came back as clear about 3 weeks later, mentioning a polyp. So I believe the biopsy was enough to be able to test it. But I do know now that I could have been offered a general anaesthetic, and probably would have been if anyone had taken an adequate history.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-04-30T21:25:17.64","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-05-05T08:42:19.893","readBy":[{"name":"Cardiff and Vale University Health Board","count":1},{"name":"Ulster University, MBBS (Medicine) 2021","count":1},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2022)","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/842763","id":"842763"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/842763/responses","id":"842763"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/842763/healthservices","id":"842763"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/842763/tags","id":"842763"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/7a4bv_502","id":"7A4BV_502","score":2},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anaesthetic","id":"Anaesthetic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/biopsy","id":"biopsy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bleeding","id":"bleeding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cervical%20smear","id":"cervical smear"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/colposcopy","id":"colposcopy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fainting","id":"fainting"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gas%20and%20air","id":"gas and air"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hysteroscopy","id":"hysteroscopy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/menopausal","id":"menopausal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/polyp","id":"polyp"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/post%20menopausal%20bleeding","id":"post menopausal bleeding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scan","id":"scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/test","id":"test"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/uncomfortable","id":"uncomfortable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/iud","id":"iud"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/847676","id":"847676"}]},{"id":842802,"author":"Harp","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Unhelpful advice on weight loss","body":"I've had a very underactive thyroid for 20 years, taking thyroid tablets every day.

I started to cry & her comment was “bit emotional are we?”  \r\nThe other midwives were fantastic, answered all our questions & were so compassionate (especially the day 10 midwife).  \r\nIt would have been so much better if we’d have more continuity of care with our community midwife visits (& that my husband was allowed at the hospital & midwife appointments - he was only allowed at our two scans and was only allowed in for our emergency section almost at the end - having to do the whole thing alone was HORRIBLE).  \r\nIt’s ridiculous that during the time when you’re allowed to queue in Tesco with 100’s of people he was only allowed to stay with the baby & me for 2 hours post surgery & a 1 hour visiting slot in hospital (thankfully I was only in for 2 nights but if it had been any longer there would have been days he wouldn’t have seen our baby at all!).  \r\nWe have said this is our only baby & I feel sad there was so much of the “normal” pregnancy & birth experience he missed out on & that I had to go through alone.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-05-02T09:45:49.33","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-05-05T08:42:20.18","readBy":[{"name":"Southern Health and Social Care Trust","count":4}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/842927","id":"842927"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/842927/responses","id":"842927"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/842927/healthservices","id":"842927"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/842927/tags","id":"842927"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_32024_501","id":"ZT003_32024_501","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sad","id":"sad"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/alone","id":"alone"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/birth","id":"birth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/continuity","id":"continuity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency","id":"emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/heel%20prick","id":"heel prick"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/horrible","id":"horrible"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/midwives","id":"midwives"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/overwhelmed","id":"overwhelmed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pregnancy","id":"pregnancy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/section","id":"section"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unsure","id":"unsure"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassion","id":"compassion"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassionate","id":"compassionate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/husband%20being%20able%20to%20stay","id":"husband being able to stay"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid","id":"covid"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%2019","id":"covid 19"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/843871","id":"843871"}]},{"id":843157,"author":"Bonzo","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Orthotics Service","body":"I feel that 'Sue' has excellent customer relations, she is always very friendly and goes far beyond her duties to give an excellent and prompt customer service. &nbsp;

I felt so cared for and the advice and support was outstanding even when busy they had time to go through things and double check before I left.

I have had spine surgery for damage brought on from symphosis Pubis Disorder (a separated pelvis) during my 4th and 5th pregnancy, having no painkillers for 8 hours the next morning. All 5 boys were born naturally.  \r\nI have had a flap torn in my cornea from my son's nail. I have polyarthralgia and fibromyalgia. I KNOW PAIN. I have lived with it all of my adult life.  \r\nNOTHING I have encountered was as traumatising as the hysteroscopy I had in March this year. I was not given informed consent. I was told it would be like a period pain. I was thinking it might be about the same as getting a Mirena coil fitted. Boy, was I wrong!  \r\nIt was indescribable pain. I was having to breathe out panicked intakes of breath, like I was in Labour. I was squeezing onto the nurses hand for dear life. It was barbaric. That is the only way I can describe it.  \r\nThe fact that these procedures are carried out on women when it is expected that 1 in 4 will have an experience the same as mine should be a great source of shame for the gynaecology profession.  \r\nThe registrar who carried it out kept saying that they were testing my pain tolerance for the ablation that I should have had last year. Why? Why did they feel the need to do that? Also, I was offered a pain relief suppository AFTER the procedure. Why? Why not BEFORE?  \r\nI went home, curled up on my bed, and sobbed myself to sleep. I am a 45-year-old woman with a very high pain tolerance. This made me unable to sleep for 2 nights because it was so traumatising and so hard to get my head around why not one of the 5 people in that room stopped it when they saw my very obvious distress.  \r\nI feel that it has a base in misogyny, and not believing women when they say they are in pain.","criticality":"strongly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-04-29T12:57:59.18","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2021-05-05T10:09:17.167","readBy":[{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2022)","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/842264","id":"842264"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/842264/responses","id":"842264"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/842264/healthservices","id":"842264"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/842264/tags","id":"842264"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rvwaa_502","id":"RVWAA_502","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ablation","id":"ablation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anaesthetic","id":"Anaesthetic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/distressed","id":"distressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fibromyalgia","id":"fibromyalgia"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gynaecology","id":"gynaecology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hysteroscopy","id":"hysteroscopy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/information","id":"information"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/informed%20consent","id":"informed consent"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain%20relief","id":"pain relief"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/painful","id":"painful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/painkillers","id":"painkillers"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pelvis","id":"pelvis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pregnancy","id":"pregnancy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/procedure","id":"procedure"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sedation","id":"sedation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/spine","id":"spine"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/traumatised","id":"traumatised"}]},{"id":842599,"author":"tigernb34","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Hysteroscopy at york hospital","body":"I was told that the pain would be like period pain it was not it was excruciating I had to polyps removed and biopsy with out any pain control at all I am 58 years old have only given birth by caesarean and am post menopausal 1 in 4 women suffer terrible pain with office hysteroscopy so why was I even subjected to this as its known that post menopausal women that have never given birth naturally or had children by caesarean make up a large proportion of these 1 in 4 I feel like a guinea pig.

Everything I brought up was always listened to and taken seriously as we discussed how to move forward and such. I always felt like I was in charge and that it was for me and I had no issues whatsoever.\r\nThe sessions helped me discover more of how I truely felt and how to progress with that with some things being a larger impact on my depression than I first realised, and finding new ways to go about things.\r\nThe things I was given to do outside of the sessions were extremely helpful in gaining a better understanding of myself and more control over my depressive thoughts and behaviours. With the point of CBT being to use these learned skills and techniques to assist yourself in the future.\r\nBy the end I feel that I have a good understanding that I can help myself to further myself in this journey and that if I were to relapse I would have the means to help myself.\r\nI was completely understood and the sessions were great, I had a great experience with Victor and so with the CBT I feel 100% happy with the experience and would fully recommend using this counselling as it has truely helped me.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-05-05T11:29:02.12","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-05-05T12:31:18.367","readBy":[{"name":"Midlands Partnership NHS Foundation Trust","count":5}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/843499","id":"843499"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/843499/responses","id":"843499"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/843499/healthservices","id":"843499"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/843499/tags","id":"843499"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rrex4-inclusion-thurrock","id":"rrex4-inclusion-thurrock","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cbt","id":"cbt"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cbt%20therapist","id":"CBT therapist"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/depression","id":"depression"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helped%20me","id":"helped me"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/respected","id":"respected"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sessions","id":"sessions"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/therapist","id":"therapist"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/person%20centred%20care","id":"Person centred care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/comfortable","id":"comfortable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/listened%20to","id":"listened to"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/844307","id":"844307"}]},{"id":843516,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Great Service","body":"I went for my covid vaccination the process was very well organised, i did not have to wait very long.

So now I'm told my medication isn't changing, which is nonsense as it's not working and ssri alone is not treating my symptoms.  \r\nReally had enough of being fobbed off and ignored when u try to stick up for yourself u get made to feel like a difficult patient.  \r\nIt's 2021 and mental health care should be way better than this surely.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-05-01T23:26:18.3566667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-05-05T14:13:24.87","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Education for Scotland","count":1},{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":9}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/842914","id":"842914"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/842914/responses","id":"842914"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/842914/healthservices","id":"842914"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/842914/tags","id":"842914"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sj9-mhrc","id":"SJ9-MHRC","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ignored","id":"ignored"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/should%20listen","id":"Should listen"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/alone","id":"alone"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anti%20depressants","id":"anti depressants"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bpd","id":"BPD"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diagnosis","id":"diagnosis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ptsd","id":"ptsd"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/845621","id":"845621"}]},{"id":840681,"author":"venusqx55","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Panic and Anxiety","body":"With Lockdown 2 in place and the prospect of a 3rd I found myself getting increasingly anxious on a daily basis and this was at times leading to panic attacks. I couldn’t sleep dispute being so tired. My head and heart was racing, I felt sick, couldn’t catch my breath and was just so on edge all the time. I wasn’t however able to pinpoint what was bothering me.  \r\nAfter talking to my doctor I was advised to self refer to Inclusion Thurrock. They come back to me really quickly and I was put on a 6 week panic management course. This really helped me understand that what was happening within my body was normal and I started to feel I was taking back control.  \r\nAfter this course I went on to 8 weeks of 121 weekly sessions. These expanded on the work I had begun in the panic management course and delved deeper into my personal issues. The weekly homework allowed me to work on my issues outside of the sessions and slowly start to understand and control the panic and anxiety. Throughout the support from inclusion was second to none. They was all understanding and made me feel comfortable discussing the problems I was having.  \r\nI now feel much better able to deal with my ever reducing problems and I know if I needed inclusion help in the future I wouldn’t hesitate.  \r\nMany Thanks","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-04-21T07:27:09.0533333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-05-05T14:17:32.637","readBy":[{"name":"Midlands Partnership NHS Foundation Trust","count":5}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/840681","id":"840681"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/840681/responses","id":"840681"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/840681/healthservices","id":"840681"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/840681/tags","id":"840681"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rrex4-inclusion-thurrock","id":"rrex4-inclusion-thurrock","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/homework","id":"homework"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/responsive","id":"responsive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/seen%20quickly","id":"seen quickly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/understanding","id":"understanding"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/844345","id":"844345"}]},{"id":842957,"author":"CatrionaR","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Covid Vaccination","body":"Really well run, very friendly staff, couldn’t improve on the service","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-05-02T17:55:39.0266667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-05-05T14:21:57.523","readBy":[{"name":"Southern Health and Social Care Trust","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/842957","id":"842957"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/842957/responses","id":"842957"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/842957/healthservices","id":"842957"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/842957/tags","id":"842957"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003-cvp","id":"zt003-cvp","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helpful%20staff","id":"helpful staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vaccination","id":"vaccination"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid","id":"covid"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%20vaccination","id":"covid vaccination"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%2019","id":"covid 19"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/843881","id":"843881"}]},{"id":843040,"author":"Dumfries10","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"My stay in ward 10","body":"From start to finish I just want to say the care was excellent!

My main birth partner couldnt stay thanks to there not being siderooms which I understand but why on earth would you put a birthing woman in a room full of post natal mums with crying babies?! That is not at all helpful or conducive to labouring.  \r\nMy first midwife in the delivery suite was wonderful and calming and respected my choices to avoid lying on the bed and worked with me. She explained everything.  \r\nThen the nightshift started.  \r\nI had a midwife give me an injection when I am pretty confident I said no - although some memories are foggy which is why I havent taken further action. I had the same midwife argue with me when I said I didnt want the injection to get the placenta out and had agreed a natural third stage with my medical team. I had a midwife make jokes about missing their dinner break because I gave birth, whilst I was lying in bed after a spinal, feeling very vulnerable. It made me feel awful.  \r\nMy golden hour I got as in baby left on my chest but no one left the room, lights were kept bright -I was having my tear checked out but still I had very little alone time before going to theatre.  \r\nI had to be my own advocate every step of my stay and it was exhausting. I did not feel like people really tried to get informed consent and there was ageneral culture of, we know whats best for you so just do what we say.  \r\nThe theatre team were amazing on the other hand. My anesthetist in particular was incredible, he made me feel at ease and actually talked me through everything he was doing. And the whole room was nice and quiet and calm.  \r\nPost labour the ward experience was OK, its still really hard to be left alone at night after 2 days in labour, I was exhausted and had a jaundiced baby who needed waking 3 hourly. The ward rounds could have done with giving advice written down it was hard to retain information when sleep deprived with a baby breastfeeding during the conversation.  \r\nOne other lovely person I met was the pelvic floor physio she was really clear and made me feel comfortable. She was really helpful and have written information too.  \r\nI cant remember any names as it was 2019 and ive only just felt able to write one of these. I dont plan on giving birth in the RAH again if i can avoid it, overall it was a pretty negative experience for me.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-05-02T12:21:10.5966667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-05-05T14:57:31.25","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":7}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/842934","id":"842934"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/842934/responses","id":"842934"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/842934/healthservices","id":"842934"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/842934/tags","id":"842934"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/c418h-labsuitematernity","id":"c418h-labsuitematernity","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ignored","id":"ignored"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/advice","id":"advice"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/alone","id":"alone"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/birth","id":"birth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/calming","id":"calming"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/delivery","id":"delivery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disrespected","id":"disrespected"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/giving%20birth","id":"giving birth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/induction","id":"induction"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/induction%20of%20labour","id":"Induction of labour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/informed%20consent","id":"informed consent"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/injection","id":"injection"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/labour","id":"labour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lack%20of%20control","id":"Lack of control"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lovely","id":"lovely"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/midwife","id":"midwife"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pelvic","id":"pelvic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pelvic%20floor","id":"pelvic floor"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/physio","id":"physio"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/privacy","id":"privacy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/some%20staff","id":"some staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vulnerable","id":"vulnerable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/explanations","id":"explanations"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/involved%20in%20decisions","id":"involved in decisions"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/theatre%20team","id":"theatre team"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/844338","id":"844338"}]},{"id":843547,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Back to Pre-COVID appointment delays","body":"The earliest appointment available is 16 days away.

It is NOT ‘morning sickness’. It is an extremely debilitating condition that holds you hostage for weeks and months. Vomiting excessively every day, 24/7 nausea and an inability to keep any food and fluids down. You lose all ability to do anything for yourself; bed bound for months on end. You lose weight and you’re likely to need acute hospital intervention throughout, especially during early pregnancy. You feel scared, isolated and extremely desperate.  \r\nDuring the 5 and a half weeks of suffering with HG, I have needed emergency care on three occasions due to severe dehydration, severe constipation and an allergic reaction to medication. There is a huge lack of understanding of HG and how to treat it, both by medical professionals and by society more widely, meaning accessing the right care and support is often a real battle. A battle that is near impossible to fight while suffering HG as you’re so unwell and weak. It saddens me to say that the health care I have received so far has been very disappointing, both in the community and within hospital settings.  \r\nThat is until my partner spoke to a lovely midwife at Treliske’s maternity day assessment unit. Beth listened. Beth was compassionate. Beth was going to do everything she could to ensure I was properly assessed and given the care I desperately needed.  \r\nI was invited to attend the day assessment unit the same day however I was so severely unwell I couldn’t manage leaving my bed let alone consider the 50 minute drive to Treliske.  \r\nThe next morning I found the last bit of strength I had left to get out of bed, throw some clothes on, and my partner managed to get me to the unit.  \r\nSick bowl in hand, I was greeted by wonderful midwife Olga. Olga cared deeply too. Olga was equally as compassionate as Beth had been on the phone the day before. Olga was going to help me.  \r\nYou cannot underestimate what this meant to me. I’ve spent weeks feeling like I was falling through the cracks. Not being heard. The severity of my illness not being taken as seriously as it should be. I cried when I spoke to both Beth and Olga because I knew they were listening to me.  \r\nMy experience of care at the unit from here continued to be wonderful.  \r\nI was so severely dehydrated that my veins had collapsed meaning two midwives and a doctor were unable to insert a cannula into my arm to administer vital fluids I desperately needed. After numerous failed attempts and painful blown veins an anaesthetist was called but as it was the weekend it was taking a while. Thankfully, another doctor was called to try to assist, and she managed to access a vein in my right arm. Thank you Dr.  \r\nI was given 2 bags of fluid over 4 hours, anti-sickness medication, as well as various other meds and vitamins to help rebuild my strength. Thank you Olga for administering the anti-sickness slowly and waiting with me to make sure I didn’t have a reaction. I have been taking this same medication for several weeks now but when it is administered straight into the vein there is a risk of a different / stronger reaction, so I was very grateful to Olga for her care.  \r\nThank you to the most wonderful doctor who led my care at the unit for your compassion throughout. Dr Askaroff, thank you for believing me when I told you I had eaten no more than 4 slices of toast in the same amount of days and had drank very little, all while vomiting in between. Thank you for paying attention to how weak I was, my dry-cracked lips, ghost-like pale complexion and insisting I receive fluids regardless of ketone and blood pressure readings. Despite being rushed off your feet caring for other ladies during a busy weekend, you continually visited me to see how I was and how I was responding to treatment. Thank you for taking the time to talk me through different medication options that are safe for both me and my baby and giving me the confidence to try different things that might help with my nausea and vomiting. I very much appreciated this as previous severe reactions to other anti-sickness medications has left me very nervous when trying anything new.  \r\nI had arrived at the unit around 9am. After the fluids and medication, and managing to keep down a slice of wholemeal toast and a biscuit or two (this is a real improvement when you have HG), I had passed the stable enough to go home test. I left the unit by around 7.30pm feeling more hydrated.  \r\nThe staff at the unit have written a letter to my GP detailing the medications I should be prescribed. I am now able to access the unit for IV fluids and anti-sickness whenever I feel I am becoming dehydrated again, meaning I don’t need to go through the trauma of seeing a GP first or through the emergency department. When you have HG it is almost impossible to leave your bed let alone attend numerous appointments before getting access to vital fluids to rehydrate you. So this is such a huge relief and further testimony to the wonderful care I received. Why I wasn’t referred to this unit before now I do not know, however. It is very disappointing.  \r\nTo the lovely staff who cared for me at the unit; from the bottom of my heart, on behalf of myself, my partner and our baby, thank you so much for everything. I’ll never forget any of you during what has been and continues to be an extremely difficult time x","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-05-02T16:45:09.3933333","progress":"Story has

I was unable to walk properly or sit down. After getting registered waited for 3 hours to see the doctor. The doctor didn’t do any proper pain assessment, or investigation. She was not interested to listen to my problem or pain, she was only looking at her phone and texting while the whole conversation. I was not even given painkillers or any proscription and was asked to buy medications over the counter. Then she told me to go to queens hospital if it still hurts. So my point is why did I waste my 3-4 hours there to see a doctor if they could only advise me to go to queens hospital.

She was abrupt and condescending - I have noticed similar reviews of this doctor who has the worst \"bedside manner\" I have ever come across!! I knew I had bad sinusitis (experienced the same a couple of times in my life) after over a week of headaches, coughing up green mucus, breathlessness and exhaustion - and I knew that antibiotics would work.  I am generally well so stage three cancer seven years ago was a shock ... but I got over it.  I am a doctor's daughter and very aware of how precious a doctor's time is (also one of 6 children) so I see the doctor as little as possible - maybe twice a year.  Anyway, the doctor told me I had a virus and it would go away in a few days.  I was not happy but I endured a few more days of misery then dragged myself back to the surgery.  The same doctor was obviously not pleased to see me again and she was not happy that I wanted antibiotics - she treated me like I was an irritating nuisance ... but I was really ill and hardly able to talk.  My family were also concerned as they could see that I was really struggling and I rarely complain about my health.  Finally, the doctor agreed to write a prescription for antibiotics and advised me to wait a few days to see if the \"virus\" resolved.  I took them immediately and started to improve within 24 hours.  I was completely well once I completed the course.  I should not have to beg, I should not feel worse after seeing my doctor rather than better!!

The Practice should publish the days and times that ALL the eight GP's are actually available as it appears some are only working 2 or 3 days a week, if that. What is so difficult about booking a phone consultation? Receptionist answers phone, looks at the on-screen diary and books the next available slot - simple! Instead there is: no answer; cut-off; answer and told to call back on another day. Try the 'Econsult' in desperation and guess what - it informs one to contact the surgery! End result of GP's in general kicking the can down the road is that already overstretched & over worked A & E departments get unnecessary visits putting further pressure on them. GP's shouldn't continue hiding in their Covid fallout shelters, virtually every other sector is back to normal or near normal and some of us have been on the front line throughout the pandemic despite the associated risks. Absolutely frustrating and no logical reason for it.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2021-05-04T23:30:27","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-05-05T16:15:26","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/843594","id":"843594"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/843594/responses","id":"843594"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/843594/healthservices","id":"843594"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/843594/tags","id":"843594"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l83031","id":"L83031","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frustrating","id":"frustrating"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/normal","id":"normal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid","id":"covid"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%2019","id":"covid 19"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/under%20pressure","id":"under pressure"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/845135","id":"845135"}]},{"id":843596,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Nothing has changed , poor service and unhelpful","body":"I was promised a call back which I never received. \nThree months waiting for a referral despite promises.\nI may have used E-consult, the medical centre's new bureaucratic attempt to draw a wedge between patient and doctor, to get help and out of 7 requests, I have  received  feedback only once.\nA terrible service with unhelpful staff and receptionists.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2021-05-04T12:21:47","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2021-05-05T16:36:54","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/843596","id":"843596"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/843596/responses","id":"843596"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/843596/healthservices","id":"843596"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/843596/tags","id":"843596"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/f86022","id":"F86022","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/terrible","id":"terrible"}]},{"id":843598,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Friendly staff put you at ease","body":"Doc and nurses were very friendly before, during and after my procedure.
