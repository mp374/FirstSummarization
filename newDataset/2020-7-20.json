Or to continue to do sessions online with the option to contact someone as and when for help with it.  \r\nAfter my first phone call with Mame I realised that was the best way forward for me. I found her knowledgeable, empathetic, completely in tune with how I needed her to be to help me move forward.  \r\nShe asked what I was hoping to gain from the treatment and what outcome I was hoping for. She explained that CBT was not about making you look at things more positively, but to help enable you to respond differently to situations and therefore enable a different outcome.  \r\nThe whole way through each week I completed a questionnaire to monitor my mood and ability to cope according to my mood before each session.  \r\nShe listened to everything I had to say and once treatment had started she would praise me if I was on the 'new way' of thinking or would very emphatically but also very professionally give me examples of how I wasn't quite there yet. ( My description, not hers)  \r\nHer guidance, patience, empathy and knowledge were a complete breath of fresh air. She taught me the difference between An Aggressive, Passive (me) and Assertive approach and I learnt that for me, Assertive was definitely the way forward. And how to do it effectively.  \r\nI was sent lots of information, by email and did homework during sessions to help practice my outcome.  \r\nAt the end of my sessions of approximately 16 weeks. Mame expained the difference between my scores for mood. I had come down from a high of 21/22 to 2/22.  \r\nI still have a long way to go as it has taken 60 years to get to where I am. But at present I feel that I have the tools to move forward. If, somewhere down the line I feel a big slip of not managing, I would definitely get in touch with Inclusion Thurrock again as I found my experience a very positive one from beginning to end I was also told that I would be welcome to do so.  \r\nThank you for all your help.

If I’m honest I had been suffering with depression and anxiety longer than I have ever admitted to.  \r\nAfter losing 2 key people in my life I lost a 3rd. My nan and my aunt and uncle who had cared for me when I was younger and my dad was fighting for his life and needed my mum more than I did, at that time anyway.  \r\nMy nan loved me unconditionally, I was her world and when she passed away my world came crashing down around me. Who would love me unconditionally? Who would be my go to person? More importantly, who wouldn’t judge me for being ‘silly’? Through that time my aunt became my go to person, sadly she developed Alzheimer’s and would ask me, ‘I love you don’t I’ as quickly as she developed Alzheimer’s she was gone! 2 down I began to become anxious about leaving home, I lost all my confidence and had begun to feel worthless, not suicidal but with thoughts of how people would be better off without me. Having a young family and being married didn’t ear those dark times and thoughts. If anything they fueled them. I began to spend money like it was going out of fashion, the inexpensive crap I bought made me feel better if only for a short while, so I bought more. Had to take out payday loan after payday loan to keep up with just the basic of bills. I all the while keeping it a secret about how I felt and how I was losing control. I felt I was at rock bottom. How wrong could I be...  \r\nMy uncle became ill and passed away quickly, my mum had a stroke all the while I kept working, looking after my dad and my family. Not telling anyone what was still going on deep inside. Right then was the 2 occasions I thought of ending it all! Had it planned but for whatever reason, I didn’t do it. I just saw this as something else I had failed at! Go me! This was at rock bottom as I had been.  \r\nThere was only one person who really knew and it wasn’t because I told her, but because she knew me. My oldest friend called me out on it. She never commented about how stupid I was or what a failure I was or why hadn’t I done any housework or showered and washed my hair. Instead it was, ‘right what are we going to do about it.’ Partial relief, momentarily actually because although she had called me out on it burying the head in the sand technique I pushed all her hard work and advice to one side.  \r\nOne day about a year ago, talking with my mother in law she was commenting on how people get so low they commit suicide and she just didn’t understand it. It was then I told her, it’s easy! The plan, the need the desire to end the heartbreaking demoralizing car crash that had become my life. It all came out everything. I went to the GP who upped my antidepressants and I completed the safeguarding questionnaire. The results of that meant he referred me to inclusion Thurrock.  \r\nTo be honest I’d forgotten about it. When I got a call offering me a group session. Not what I needed or wanted so turned it down. The world went into lockdown, my answer no phones ringing no knocks at the door and limited post through my letterbox meant I could do the bury my head routine again. Then my miracle happened. I got a call offering a virtual 1:1. Also My friend who called me out on it lent me money to clear my debts with an affordable repayment - but Jade from inclusion Thurrock became my beginning of the end. The first day I spoke with Jade I hadn’t showered or been worried about my personal hygiene for nearly 2 weeks. This was as low as I had ever been. Our first meeting I thought yeah right like she is gonna be able to help. I even thought that on the second session. But... the 3rd session was where it began to change, not overnight but going in the right direction. Jade was no fool she knew exactly how I was playing the game and she held me accountable, not in a bad way but just gave me a scenario of changing one word. I kept using the word selfish, over a couple of weeks she had me using more positive words like self care. She gave me homework which was more like targets of what I needed to do that week, walk, make notes, plan ahead but they gave me focus on something different. I began seeing things very differently. I’m not going to lie and say it was a walk in the park because to admit wrong doings, dark thoughts etc made me especially evaluate what I already knew - life ain’t easy! The weekly questionnaires not only gave Jade the feedback she needed to know the direction of the plan, but it gave me time to evaluate how I was truly feeling. Rather than just ticking the I feel crap box I begun to question - do I feel crap though.  \r\nThe long and short of it this service saved me, not necessarily from suicide but from living a life of feeling worthless and unloved.  \r\nI was told by a colleague this week Smiffy has her spunk back and yes I do the future doesn’t frighten me anymore because I have the strategies in my mind map and know how to cross each hurdle I’m not looking at life through rose tinted spectacles life’s rollercoasters are still going to come along it’s how I deal with them that will prevent me relapsing back into old trails of thoughts but allowing myself an occasional lapse just means I’ve finally got it sorted.  \r\nI can’t thank Jade enough, her commitment to me while we met all be it virtually showed me I could do it. When she asked if I was ready for this to be the last session I paused. I waited to see if the sinking feeling came back. Jade noticed this and asked why I paused I explained and she said well what did you notice. I noticed no sinking feeling and knew there would never be a better opportunity to take the leap of faith. I’m now enrolled in an access to higher education diploma, I’m exercising and feel good.  \r\nI know I’ve gone on but it’s important to hear why I needed help and how the help came.  \r\nTiny steps win the race and inclusion Thurrock became the end of my old ways of thought and the beginning of the new.  \r\n#corny but what’s life without a bit of drama.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-07-17T21:59:29.5233333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-07-20T14:47:27.647","readBy":[{"name":"Midlands Partnership NHS Foundation Trust","count":5},{"name":"Sheffield University Medical School 2020","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/777018","id":"777018"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/777018/responses","id":"777018"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/777018/healthservices","id":"777018"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/777018/tags","id":"777018"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rrex4-inclusion-thurrock","id":"rrex4-inclusion-thurrock","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/commitment","id":"commitment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helped","id":"helped"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sessions","id":"sessions"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/strategies","id":"strategies"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/positivity","id":"Positivity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/remote%20consultation","id":"remote consultation"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/778329","id":"778329"}]},{"id":776996,"author":"mum of vulnerable 10 year old","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Frustration under Covid restrictions ease - letting our vulnerable kids down","body":"My 10 year old Daughter was seeing a counsellor from CAMHS at the Hamilton base, who was absolutely fantastic and gained my daughters trust fairly quickly and we felt as though we were making good progress...…. then obviously Covid struck and kids were dismissed and discharged in a video call which was very emotional for all concerned.  \r\nI was sent some links from our counsellor in order to help try and deal with this at home …. When contacting one of the links I was told that they did not deal with individual cases of support and I would have to go back to GP etc, this was very frustrating.  \r\nMy daughters mental health and anxiety has escalated considerably during Covid, has affected her eating, sleeping, severe moods, to the point where she would not even do her schoolwork, go out on bike, get out her bed or eat somedays.  \r\nI contacted the school, prior to closure as I was told they could be a source of support and got nothing back.  \r\nI Myself suffer from anxiety and depression and I could see the signs excalate very quickly, I contacted my local GP, who was fab and said she definately needed to be referred back to the Camhs team again. This process was fab and very officiant I am pleased to say and before I knew it my original contact was back on the phone to try and help us out...... with a video call.  \r\nThis however was a bit of a disaster, between links not working and being lost several times, to the fact that it has been 5 months since my daughter had seen the member of staff, who she adored, so she was obviously very nervous, worried and completely out of her comfort zone and therefore a total closed book. We are of course going to try a few phone calls between them both to try and open up the trust again, but I find it absolutely ludicrous, frustrating and angry that the NHS are advising that the Camhs team may not start again until November, my daughter is 10 years old, who does not have to socially distance from other kids under 12, she will be going back to school full time in Aug, where she will be socially distancing from her teacher, she can go to football coaching and distance herself from her coach, why NHS can she not be allowed in a room with her counsellor at 2m safe distance in order to protect and help her mental health and anxiety. This definately needs reviewing as it is letting our vulnerable children down.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-07-17T18:23:19.9266667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-07-20T15:16:55.53","readBy":[{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2022)","count":1},{"name":"NHS Lanarkshire","count":8},{"name":"Sheffield University Medical School 2021","count":1},{"name":"North Lanarkshire Health & Social Care Partnership","count":2},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2020)","count":1},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":1},{"name":"Scottish Recovery Network","count":1},{"name":"Sheffield University Medical School 2020","count":1},{"name":"Partnership for Change","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/776996","id":"776996"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/776996/responses","id":"776996"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/776996/healthservices","id":"776996"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/776996/tags","id":"776996"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sl9-camhs","id":"SL9-camhs","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/angry","id":"angry"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frustrating","id":"frustrating"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/worried","id":"worried"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/camhs","id":"camhs"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/concerned","id":"concerned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/counsellor","id":"counsellor"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/depression","id":"depression"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/discharge%20information","id":"discharge information"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gp%20referral","id":"gp referral"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/individualised%20care","id":"individualised care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/signs","id":"signs"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/technology","id":"technology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20concerned","id":"very concerned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vulnerable","id":"vulnerable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/video%20consultation","id":"video consultation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/service%20updated%20to%20meet%20restrictions%20lifted","id":"service updated to meet restrictions lifted"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/777487","id":"777487"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/777603","id":"777603"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/777885","id":"777885"}]},{"id":776552,"author":"Vonne","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Excruciating pain caused by nerve damage","body":"I rarely visit the practice and can usually manage my own health issues.

I couldn't move or walk. I have had a problem with an ovarian cyst that I had operated on on the same side a few years ago and was absolutely certain this was what was happening.\n\nI spoke at length about how I also suffer with mental health issues with the paramedics which include severe anxiety and CPTSD. One of them was incredible and couldn't help enough. The other so rude my partner even commented on this. \n\nWas wheeled in in a wheelchair and was banged into every wall on the way. It hurt even to sit and I was told to wait in a side room with two older men who were clearly suffering with issues with substances. As a young girl with mental health problems this really distressed me. Luckily I found the lovely paramedic who organised for me to be sat in a side room.\n\nHad blood work done and was told I had high levels of potassium. Which with my medical experience I know is very serious. He asked to take more blood and I never saw him again. I was still sitting in a chair and after an hour sobbing with no one coming to see if I was ok asked a nurse if there was anywhere I could lie down as there were plenty of beds.\n\nShe very rudely told me to follow her. I asked if I could have some help and she told me not to be a baby and stormed off walking with me trying to walk still in tears.\n\nI was then sat near the major resus unit, again in a chair, where all the staff seemed to be. I again sat crying my heart out in so much pain for another hour and no one came to my assistance. I was eventually approached by a dr who finally moved me to a bed.\n\nI was given a mixture of pain meds and told that my pain was sciatica. Which I said I 100% did not believe as I knew the pain I was having from experience. He said he had never known a case of gynae problems causing this much pain that also affected my leg, gave me a prescription for diazepam and told me to leave.\n\nI have no idea what my blood levels are like. No offer of any kind of scan. No follow up. Am lying in bed since coming home in floods of tears. Absolutely let down.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-07-21T01:27:35","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-07-21T06:36:08","readBy":[{"name":"East Suffolk and North Essex NHS Foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/777317","id":"777317"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/777317/responses","id":"777317"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/777317/healthservices","id":"777317"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/777317/tags","id":"777317"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rdee4","id":"RDEE4","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood","id":"blood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cyst","id":"cyst"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/distressed","id":"distressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gynae","id":"gynae"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/heart","id":"heart"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/leg","id":"leg"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ovarian","id":"ovarian"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ovarian%20cyst","id":"ovarian cyst"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scan","id":"scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sciatica","id":"sciatica"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wheelchair","id":"wheelchair"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/777625","id":"777625"}]},{"id":777318,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"My visit to the hospital for a Colonoscopy","body":"I would like to say that the \n wonderful treatment and care that I received in this department yesterday was second to none.\nALL of the staff were caring and very professional.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-07-21T06:09:29","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-07-21T06:46:58","readBy":[{"name":"Royal Surrey County Hospital NHS Foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/777318","id":"777318"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/777318/responses","id":"777318"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/777318/healthservices","id":"777318"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/777318/tags","id":"777318"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/ra201","id":"RA201","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/777339","id":"777339"}]},{"id":777320,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Phone line constantly engaged","body":"Having been advised to phone Monday 20th July to get an appointment to speak to the doctor who authorised a blood test, I tried for 40 minutes to contact the surgery. All I got was the engaged tone except for three occasions when the call seemed to connect only to be cut off after one ring. This seemed as if someone lifted the receiver and put it down again deliberately to cut off the call. I tried the phone line several times during the day but, again just got the engaged tone. On 20th July I had several phone calls in and out on my landline so I deduce that my telephone is not faulty. I tried the surgery number late in the day, as an experiment, and was immediately connected to a recorded message. This shows that the telephone number is working.\nI have been unwell for the last several weeks but in the present virus situation and out of consideration for the overworked NHS, had kept attempted contact with the surgery to a minimum. \nAt last, a couple of weeks ago, I was able to have a telephone conversation GP who was very helpful and organised a blood test. This GP told me at the time that the results may need to be followed up. \nWhen I enquired about my test results on Friday 17th July, I was told that a follow up was required, as previously advised by the GP, and that I should phone on the morning of Monday 20th July to book an appointment. \nThis was hopeless due to the phone line being constantly engaged, as previously described.\nOn three occasions in the last four years (well before coronavirus) I have had to resort to paying for a consultation with a private doctor after being told that either GP's were too busy to see me, I could have an appointment two or three weeks in the future, or just being fobbed off with the excuse that no appointments were available. It is hardly surprising that I have little or no faith in the NHS. \nI am 75 years old, have been unwell for some weeks and now cannot access help from a medical professional due to the seeming inability of the surgery to have a working phone line. \n   ","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-07-21T04:22:48","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-07-21T06:48:05","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/777320","id":"777320"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/777320/responses","id":"777320"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/777320/healthservices","id":"777320"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/777320/tags","id":"777320"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/f81100","id":"F81100","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hopeless","id":"Hopeless"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood","id":"blood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20test","id":"blood test"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/connected","id":"connected"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/test","id":"test"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/780953","id":"780953"}]},{"id":777319,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Not good experiences ","body":"I've been attending here for 20 months and never been too impressed but now they've got my blood test results mixed up, gave me the wrong results earlier and the receptionist was so abrasive about it when I rang to try and clear it up, that she couldn't get me off the phone quick enough and I'm still none the wiser about my blood test. \nI'm usually all for giving people the benefit of the doubt but there is no need for rudeness.

He tested positive for Covid-19.  He was fully sedated and put on a ventilator.  After 3 weeks he was given a tracheostomy, which was removed after 2 weeks.  He spent 2 nights in CCU before being moved to Ward 7 for just over a week.  He completed his stay in Abbey View, for rehabilitation.  He returned home after 9 weeks in hospital.                                              The care he received saved his life and was compassionate and sensitive throughout.\nI was unable to visit him in the early days but the communication from the staff, particularly from those in ICU, was always clear, honest but encouraging and reassuring.  They took time to answer my questions and did not rush me, although they must have been very busy and under pressure.\nMy husband has been at home for almost 8 weeks and is making slow, steady progress towards recovery, which we know will take months.  He was well-supported by physiotherapists and the occupational therapist to start with and the respiratory nurse is still working with him now, to help him get stronger, by walking a reasonable distance, with the help of some oxygen support.\nWe are so grateful to all the professionals, who have been involved in his care, rehabilitation and recovery. \nOne piece of constructive feedback would be to suggest that when patients are being moved between wards, it would be helpful to give ample warning and an explanation of the next stage in the treatment.  When a fragile patient is feeling uncertain and vulnerable and has settled into a ward, a change of surroundings can be quite traumatic.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-07-20T17:24:50","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-07-21T06:53:41","readBy":[{"name":"University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/777321","id":"777321"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/777321/responses","id":"777321"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/777321/healthservices","id":"777321"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/777321/tags","id":"777321"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rtx","id":"RTX","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/traumatic","id":"traumatic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ccu","id":"ccu"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/oxygen","id":"oxygen"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/positive","id":"positive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/rehabilitation","id":"rehabilitation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/respiratory","id":"respiratory"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stronger","id":"stronger"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ventilator","id":"ventilator"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vulnerable","id":"vulnerable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported","id":"supported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/saved","id":"saved"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/835851","id":"835851"}]},{"id":777322,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Good Service","body":"Thank you to the Receptionists for helping with queries and passing on information to the relevant place.\nThe recent telephone Asthma review I had was excellent, supportive and informative.

However, now I've had an bad ear infection in both ears for 6 months. Saw a lovely nurse who took swabs and gave ear drops 4 months ago. My ears still the same and in alot of pain now. Called surgery to arrange dr appt as felt I needed reassurance from a dr and maybe a referral as am worried ear infections have spread behind ear drum.  Was shocked to be told drs wont see ear infections now and it's only nurses!!!! I said I'd had it for far too long and I need a dr to check them (more qualified) as I know ear infections if left spread to your bone and result in permanent hearing difficulties.  Was basically told only a nurse will see you, theres nothing.more they can do.  How can you leave a patient in pain, with muffled hearing and think it doesny need a dr to see me.  I got off the phone and cried at the coldness and how neglected if feel.  I truly dont know what to do now. How can drs just dismiss you like that. It's been 6 months and it's getting worse.

I am usually seen bt a psychiatrist, a CPN ( nurse) and have monthly injections of my MH medication.  \r\nIn this Trust we are told got to A&E when in crisis and we have 3 A&E. The crisis teams are across the 2 council areas that make up this Trust. For 10 yrs they have not increased the staff from one worker only per borough on duty. Not a single professional in this MH Trust seems to think that 2 workers for a population of half million residents a problem. Even when they tut and shake their heads and say that's awful when pts tell them how poor The crisis team or line in before coronavirus.  \r\nThe management here actually justify the appalling treatment of people in crisis by using this ratio as an excuse. God knows what the CCGs who fund have been doing all this time, maybe someone should ask why mentally ill pts aren't getting emergency access to treatment. I don't care about the words MH workers use saying a crisis and an emergency are different - No they are not if you are the person about to jump off a bridge or in front of a truck!Once COVID-19 came it got so much worse- it was like they forgot they are actually emergency NHS and just like in physical healthcare expected to see pts. I went to 2 of the 3 A&E's in March before official lockdown on 23rd. Except the A&Es by then were already turning away MH pts unless had taken overdose.But at the same time there was NO place to be seen in crisis. None. Not until weeks later when a hub was opened in the psych hospital grounds and then twice I was screamed at for going there without ringing ahead, when the A&E had told me to. Who on earth in a MH trust thinks someone in a life-threatening situation should have to call what is always an answerphone to get life-saving treatment?On 5 separate incidents in March alone, I was getting more and more suicidal. I was agitated, not sleeping at all, they knew I had attempted suicide before and ended up in ICU. I am under the Care of the MH Trust but the community team completely shut down at same time. No letters about what to do, no appts, no duty line as ALWAYS engaged or to answerphone or sometimes just diverted into the void.ALL GPs had shut down and because the MH Trust had not updated my GP re: medication it was stopped dead, which is probably why I was getting so unwell. The clinic i am meant to go to in my mh team just shut its doors so my injections stopped and no gp so no one to chase it.  \r\n4 times my friend rang the crisis line and was told there was NO crisis team because of the virus. And the crisis houses told me they were only taking patients from the wards. It took 3 weeks for the hub place to see me then they sent me to Whittington hospital because I had by now taken too much of an old medication because I couldn't get mine and A&E there sent me back. The crisis team at the hub told me to go away because they don't deal with overdoses and so in one night I ended up there twice and 2 different A&E. Everybody said go away even when I told them I was suicidal had missed injections now twice.  \r\nStill now they are not working. I was sectioned by police in another part of London and spent 3 days in a different MH Trust. This one said they had no beds so I was discharged and still no follow up. In the end police and ambulance kept coming to my home because I was at risk and they could not take me anywhere either as nowhere would take a MH patient who needed medical care as well . I needed blood tests and also had a cough but I didn't think it was coronavirus because I have asthma. I don't know if these are real nurses in the crisis team and they said they had no doctors when I went but who knows if that was true. It is a mess in mental health and they STILL not giving appts when I know others who have appts for routine physical care in the same hospitals and elsewhere.  \r\nMy GP says she hasnt heard from the MH Trust and has contacted them again and again. I can't be supported on the phone when very unwell like many many mental health patients. I have friends who don't even have phones and have been sectioned because this. Trust staff didn't make face to face appointments for people who couldn't do phone ones. The GP says the NHS told MH Trusts to make sure they saw pts and they didn't. In the end my GP had to do some special arrangements and send me to a different place to get my depot injections. I think this Trust is a very dangerous place and wonder what sort of doctors and nurses behave like this? I felt that they were so aggressive, even the police and ambulance seemed to agree and were arguing with them and said it was a real problem they couldn't take anyone for mental health safety. It is their job so what have they been doing this whole time and WHY STILL no appointments face to face?","criticality":"moderately

and mandibular osteotomy)  \r\nThis happened a couple of years ago but I felt compelled to write due to the fact it has changed his whole life  \r\nIt has brought about a totally changed person in my son and given myself and my wife great peace of mind  \r\nHe was bullied at school and college due to his looks and once came home saying he wanted to die, the verbal and physical anguish he faced on a daily basis was horrendous to hear and my wife and I worried constantly especially about his mental health  \r\nHe was the first thing I thought about every morning and the last thing I thought about before going to sleep  \r\nTo see my son so upset every day took a toll on him and us as a family, he had no self confidence, no self worth and constant held his hand over his jaw as people would stare  \r\nAfter the operation I showed him a picture of his new face as he lay in the hospital bed and he broke down and cried he was so happy, in fact we all cried.  \r\nI can never thank Mr Panesar his orthodontist and Mr Williams his surgeon enough they were not only exceptional at their jobs but they always had time for the questions this father had  \r\nThey turned his life round and I can finally sleep at night  \r\nThe care he received was exemplary and I could not ask for anything better from all involved  \r\nAn absolutely massive thank you","criticality":"not

patient","title":"Systemic Refusal to any post Traumatic Brain Injury care.","body":"My issues have been going on for 36 years, however, the last 3 in particular, now that I'm fully aware of the root cause and condition of my health issue, my experience has been Kafkaesque at best.  \r\nIn 1984 as a teenager I sustained a Traumatic Brain Injury after falling into an uncovered streetworks excavation on a dark night, while returning home from an errand. The result was an operation to treat an Extradural Haematoma 48 hours later, having spent this time deteriorating in an A&E ward. Physically on the surface I appeared to have made a fully recovery, however, I experienced severe fatigue, headaches and sensory issues. My concentration was poor, as was my ability to retain new information. Not ideal for a teenager about to start university. After approaching my GP with my parents, I was accused of malingering and my parents were informed that all that was required was that I needed a \"good shake\".  \r\nRoll forward a few years after having failed university and mental health problems have came into my life in addition to the aforementioned sequelae. At every juncture with mental health services I asked if the roots of my problem lay with the TBI. At every juncture I was given a diagnosis from psychosis to GAD, OCD, or depression.  \r\nRoll forward to 2016 and I'm about to commence my third stay in as many years at a private sector psychiatric hospital after yet another breakdown and a head full of suicidal ideation. At this point the consultant psychiatrist decided to consider that there may be an organic root to my decades long mental health issues which had been, despite my best efforts, remaining unresolved. Again the TBI wasn't considered, this time it was the possibility of an ASD. One year after obtaining a GP referreral to Autism Scotland my name came up on the list for an assessment, which I had in March 2017. The Psychology team at Autism Scotland concluded that I did not meet the criteria for an ASD diagnosis, however it appeared I was suffering from issues in my pre-frontal cortex as a result of my TBI. This was confirmed in August 2017 by a private sector Clinical Psychologist with decades of experience in the field of Brain Injury.  \r\nAt his suggestion my wife approached NHS Lanarkshire for assistance, only to be refused. No other mental health support was forthcoming and after yet another episode of a breakdown and suicidal ideation I spent October 2017 in a private sector Psychiatric Hospital.  \r\nI began seeing the private sector Clinical Psychologist in January 2018 and began identifying the myriad of issues that a person faces after a TBI; the headaches; the concentration; the memory problems; the challenges to my executive function; emotional dysregulation and lability; speech issues and the FATIGUE!-my nemesis; every day is a lottery as to whether I will have enough energy to carry out the basic functions that comprise my eroded daily life. The Clinical Psychologist made it clear that additional support would be required from the NHS if I was to gain a daily existence that bore any resemblance to 'normal daily daily living'. None of this was forthcoming. I subsequently spent February 2019 again back in a private sector Psychiatric Hospital with exactly the same mental health issues and by that time we had moved home to the NHS Forth Valley area.  \r\nSince first having my long standing suspicions that my health issues were related to my TBI confirmed in 2017, my wife and I have carried out extensive research both online (and there are many peer reviewed scientific and medical papers on the subject) and with the help of the Headway Scotland charity. There is a great deal of easily accessible information out there. It begs the question; why has nobody I have encountered in the health profession with the exception of a Professor at Autism Scotland and the private sector Clinical Psychologist I have been attending been privvy to this extensive information?  \r\nIn August 2019, in a moment of utter despair, I swallowed every tablet I have in the desperate hope of ending my pain and sheer trauma. I was taken to A&E and when it was established that I had not taken enough tablets to ensure the lethality I so desperately sought, I was discharged. On visiting my GP a few days later I was referred to Forth Valley mental health services. Two months later after some further calls from my GP, I received my first home visit from two Occupational Therapists. During this visit, I gave my account of the last 35 years of living with a TBI. A few days later I received a letter with what looked like a Christmas list; I would receive OT input in order to help me with my now defunct daily living skills; I would undergo a CT scan to assess my neurological health; I would receive a full Neuro-Psychological assessment; and I would be appointed a Psychiatrist.  \r\nThus far, bearing in mind that the letter I received was in October 2019, the following commitments have been fulfilled:  \r\n1. I have received 3 visits from an OT.  \r\n2. I have had a CT scan in November 2019 however, the results have never been discussed with me other than the brief comment \"your brain injury is quite obvious on the CT scan\".  \r\n3. I have had one Psychiatric appointment in November 2019 where the problem with my current medication; I have been on since its prescription at the private sector Psychiatric Hospital in October 2017 was discussed owing to its lack of SMC approval. No other issues were discussed other than that I would undergo regular Psychiatric appointments by March 2020 at the very latest. This medication has allowed me a full nights sleep after more than 30 years of chronic insomnia. I have been found wanting after 30 years of a BNF full of a myriad of pschotropic medication; from the chemical cosh of Chlorpromazine in the 90's, to Tricyclics, to SSRIs of every flavour. I currently pay privately for my medication at great expense over and above the private sector psychiatric and psychological treatments I have had since 2012.  \r\nIn conclusion, has my experience been;  \r\n1. Good? ...At no point has it been less than traumatic.  \r\n2. What could have been better? ... Everything, or perhaps my parents should have eschewed the Brain Operation in 1984 and allowed me to die.  \r\n3. How do I feel about my care? ...What care? At what point will anyone care? Personally, I feel my next point of contact with NHS Scotland will be to become nothing other than an entry in the book of statistics documenting yet another figure in the leading cause of death for men of my age.","criticality":"strongly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-07-06T18:11:22.8266667","progress":"Story has a

Being from the north west area we were put up by CHUF in scott house so the worry and stress of were to stay was taken away. Brilliant doctors, nurses, consultant, surgeons, play therapist, dietitians the list is endless of the people and support systems they have in place. Our story sadly didn't end well and we lost our gorgeous girl but we are so proud of her and her fight and also the people who helped us through them dark moments while in hospital. Even after her death they still phone to check on us. Our hearts will never heal but we know that she was taken care of in the best place and they did everything humanly possible to keep her with us. Thank you will never be enough for giving our girl an extra 4 months with us. Memories made.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-07-20T17:01:01.1866667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-07-21T13:51:23.867","readBy":[{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2020)","count":1},{"name":"The Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust","count":2},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2022)","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/777252","id":"777252"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/777252/responses","id":"777252"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/777252/healthservices","id":"777252"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/777252/tags","id":"777252"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rtd01_102","id":"RTD01_102","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cardiac","id":"cardiac"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/death","id":"death"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fight","id":"fight"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/heart","id":"heart"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helped","id":"helped"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/transplantation","id":"transplantation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/well%20looked%20after","id":"well looked after"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/well%20organised","id":"well organised"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/whole%20team","id":"whole team"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/778129","id":"778129"}]},{"id":777067,"author":"Fairtricket","authorRoleId":4,"authorRole":"a relative","title":"Home respiratory nurse","body":"My stepmum was admitted to Aberdeen Royal infirmary a week past Sunday and she was discharged on the Thursday with a home non-invasive ventilation kit to help her with her Type II respiratory failure.  \r\nShe wasn’t very sure how to use the equipment and as a family we struggled over that weekend to support her to use it. We have since made contact with Trish, the home respiratory service lead nurse. Trish is amazing. Her patience and commitment to her job is commendable. She is supporting us daily to work with mum to help use the system.  \r\nShe has listened to our woes and has offered us comfort and excellent advice. If you have an award scheme for staff who go above and beyond the job then I would like to nominate Trish. If you could see yourselves to invest more into the service to offer seven day funded support then we think this would be money well spent.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-07-18T09:48:11.5533333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-07-21T14:06:27.063","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Grampian","count":3}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/777067","id":"777067"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/777067/responses","id":"777067"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/777067/healthservices","id":"777067"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/777067/tags","id":"777067"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/n101h_340","id":"N101H_340","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/above%20and%20beyond","id":"above and beyond"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/advice","id":"advice"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/empathy","id":"empathy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/expertise","id":"expertise"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurse","id":"nurse"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professional","id":"professional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/respiratory","id":"respiratory"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ventilation","id":"ventilation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing","id":"amazing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/patience","id":"patience"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported","id":"supported"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/777421","id":"777421"}]},{"id":777087,"author":"john do","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Car parking at the Vic'","body":"I attend the Victoria three times per week, every week.
