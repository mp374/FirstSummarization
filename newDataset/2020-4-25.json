When I arrived at the clinic , the waiting room was set up according to social distancing measures and all staff were wearing protective gear. I felt protected and I hope they did too. The consultant was very kind and explained what would happen. I had a mammogram and an ultrasound scan, both of which were very comfortable and done with care and compassion. All staff were very friendly and it all felt very “normal” - unlike practically everything else at the moment! I received my results after the imaging (fortunately benign), spoke again to the consultant and was discharged.\nI know people are feeling concerned about visiting their GP or hospital and perhaps trying “ignore” potentially serious health symptoms like mine but don’t!

After the initial check at triage I was taken straight to a monitor for a more detailed check on how baby is doing. Despite telling the midwife who looked after me whilst at the monitor my contractions are now less than 2 minutes and extremely painful, she insisted I would go home and come back as she thinks in only 2 hours I could not be dilated enough to make it to the labour ward and I may need another 2 hours. She continued to repeat the best place to be would be at home because after the monitor the indications were the baby is  fine. I insisted I am not going home because I was concerned I could not deal with that level of pain at home and thats my final decision. Because of this the next step would be to measure how dilated I was and if I would be less than 4 which she continued to insist I am most likely to be I would not be able to go labour ward not my husband would be able to join. After the check she measured a 6 cm dilation and I was taken straight to labour ward; I was hugely relieved that at this point my husband was able to attend. On arrival to labour ward we were designated a room without having to wait at all. The midwife who took over to help with the birth genuinely left me so impressed. She was so calm, supportive and clearly just great at her job. At each step she talked me and my husband through every decision she had to make and why. The student with her also very kind and supportive. Our baby girl arrived at 7am that morning and we could not ask for more about the way we were all looked after from arrival to labour ward until we left to go home that afternoon. Their support, kindness, care and communication whilst there were great and made the whole process seem so much easier let alone all of this of this happened during the Coronavirus pandemic...

In many ways the practice has the feel of a holistic ‘old school’ proper family practice and I feel very fortunate to be a patient here.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-04-26T11:10:18","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-04-26T15:53:15","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/758980","id":"758980"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/758980/responses","id":"758980"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/758980/healthservices","id":"758980"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/758980/tags","id":"758980"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/h85618","id":"H85618","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fortunate","id":"fortunate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pregnancy","id":"pregnancy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tests","id":"tests"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/902063","id":"902063"}]},{"id":758983,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Terrible patient treatmemt","body":"I never leave reviews anywhere as I'm not that type of person unless it's something good but on this occasion I want to pre warn any fathers going through the same thing, my partner has been admitted hear twice and the neglect from both staff and doctors is actually terrible, five different doctors in four months to assess patients as they couldn't find a permanent doctor, mother's not being helped when struggling with the strain of anxiety and depression, I've been told not to name any staff which I won't but just to make you all aware they don't care about patients and have no sympathy for the daily struggles mums go through, my partner has been discharged when she was only 30% better and still struggling and now the second time she is in there she is even worse and they are trying to discharge her after an overdose attempt, I am writing this review to warn of what to expect if you go through a similar situation as a father.

Upon arrival we were told that I would have to go in on my own due to covid19. At the time I was six weeks pregnant (my first) and was quite simply terrified about what was going on. After giving my details at reception, I was quickly seen by the triage nurse who was without doubt the most calming and kind person. I was so fortunate that not only did she organise very quickly for me to go to the obstetrics and gynaecology department (something which I understand is very hard to arrange as they are so busy) but she also didn’t leave my side, completing all the assessments I needed prior to going up and reassured me the whole way. She even organised for herself and a fellow nurse to wheel me up as I felt faint. \nI wish I had asked her name as her badge was covered since I would love to give her a gift in thanks. Herself and the other nurses made what really was a daunting, scary and worrying time into one where I felt supported and human. \nIn the end, at 3am (3hours after I entered the building) and after lots and lots of tests, I was offered a scan. I was told the scan would be at 8.45 and that I could stay in if I wanted. By this point I decided to go home and come back as the pain had eased somewhat.

I was taken and given a bed whilst having all the checks, speaking to the cesarean team, whilst my husband waited at home. Soon around 9am he was called in and we were excitedly going to theatre. Just before the spinal block an emergency was called to theatre. We got taken to our labour room (empty) and told to wait. We completly understood as our previous girl had been an alarm bell emergency so we were fully prepared to wait for those in a more important situation. Thursday was a busy day and 7 hours later, after being NIL by mouth for 17 hours and 4 hours with no water I just wanted to go home and come back when they were ready. I was feeling sad and just wanted to go. Despite being Completely busy the midwife team saw that I had been sitting on a visitors chair for 6 hours and couldn't apologise enough. She seemed horrified! They got my bed and told us the team (theatre team that had worked all day) had confirmed they would stay on working so our wait wouldn't be in vain. We were beyond grateful, and despite working flat out all day they even clapped us on re-entry!\n\nThe section was very calm and clear and controlled. We got wonderful skin to skin afterwards. Like I, my husband had a fantastic experience. He was able to take pictures and be close to me for everything from the spinal block (which they had to redo) to the operation. The team have a wonderful sense of humour and made it an experience we will never forget for all the right reasons.  After a traumatizing first birth we particularly appreciated this bit. \n\nRecovery was good. It is to be expected- busy ward -lots of rotating staff - strict and necessary proceedures (PPE). But each Member of staff tried to understand us as indivuduals and nothing was too much an ask. Breast feeding was SO supportive and has given me bags of confidence. \n\nHad him at 17:39 Thursday went home 10:30 Saturday. Thankyou to such a wonderful team of skilled professionals. We were in our own bubble during our time at Musgrove and never felt like we were in the middle of a pandemic.

From the minute I went into triage, until I was taken into the labour ward I was made feel at ease.. now I can’t remember the midwives name who helped in triage but she was fantastic! Aisling was a student midwife who from the moment I got taken into the labour room made me feel at ease... she greeted me with a huge smile (underneath her mask, but I could tell she was smiling) she kept me entertained and relaxed! I know this is the job of all midwives but for a student midwife who was not long out of uni, she was fantastic! She was great with my sarcastic husband and even though I was pretty out of it, there was never any silence. She continued to keep him distracted! We weren’t fortunate enough for baby to come whilst aisling was on shift, baby came 5 minutes after she finished, however we were out in the amazing hands of Karen another student midwife! Who was amazing she was only in the door 45 mins and had helped deliver our little chubby bundle of joy... the other midwife in the room, julie I think her name was she was amazing and I’m pretty sure she deserves a medal for her hands alone allowing me to squeeze them!

From when we got there until we left, the staff were great.  \r\nWhen I arrived I knew I would need a wheelchair for my son as I couldn't carry him from the car park up to the entrance. I spoke to the charge nurse who was working triage outside and he kindly said he would get one for us if I drove up with him and then parked.  \r\nWe were triaged outside as standard right now to ensure we had no covid symptoms. The SCN was kind and friendly with my son which helped him understand that behind the masks etc were just normal people and nothing to be scared of.  \r\nI'd like to highlight the exceptional care we received from an emergency nurse practitioner, I think her name was Lyndsey? She explained everything amazingly and in such a simplified way that my son understood. She treated him very maturely by addressing him mainly and myself when needed. As I a nurse myself I understood what had likely happened however being in parent mode meant everything I knew went completely out my head. Lyndsey's simple explanation helped immensely and her kind and caring demeanor kept us calm.  \r\nUnfortunately due to the PPE I doubt I'd ever recognise her to thank her if I seen her again when I'm at work so I thought that this would be a good avenue to give her the recognition she deserves.  \r\nThank you! 2 weeks later and my son's adjusting to his boot well although I keep having to remind him he's not invincible.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-04-24T20:42:39.0233333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-04-27T12:32:20.69","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Ayrshire & Arran","count":7},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/758854","id":"758854"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/758854/responses","id":"758854"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/758854/healthservices","id":"758854"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/758854/tags","id":"758854"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/a111h_180-children","id":"A111H_180-children","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ankle","id":"ankle"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency","id":"emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good","id":"good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helped","id":"helped"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/informative","id":"informative"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/triage","id":"triage"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/calm","id":"calm"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/simple%20explanations","id":"simple explanations"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/759080","id":"759080"}]},{"id":759015,"author":"Thank you for everything","authorRoleId":4,"authorRole":"a relative","title":"End of life care","body":"My grandfather sadly passed in ward 8.

Donna was fantastic as well, and was a great help after labour.  \r\nThank you so much both Zoe and Donna.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-04-25T20:55:30.5066667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-04-27T14:40:34.333","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Grampian","count":4},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/758968","id":"758968"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/758968/responses","id":"758968"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/758968/healthservices","id":"758968"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/758968/tags","id":"758968"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/n161h_501","id":"N161H_501","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/all%20staff","id":"all staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/birth","id":"birth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/caring","id":"caring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/labour","id":"labour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/midwives","id":"midwives"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/feel%20very%20lucky","id":"Feel very lucky"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20ease","id":"at ease"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/759032","id":"759032"}]},{"id":758987,"author":"hoc majorum virtus","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"A thank you to those who cared for my dad","body":"To all of those working and caring during this time,  \r\nMy father passed away on Saturday 11th April. He was one of many who have, and will continue to be beaten by the Coronavirus.  \r\nAs unthinkably painful as his death is to all his family and friends, it is possible to find some slight comfort in the knowledge of everyone who helped care for him in his last days. This is a thank you to those people. The country already thanks you all every Thursday at 8pm but on behalf of my father, we would like to thank, individually, everyone that we witnessed genuinely making a difference from the start of this awful experience until its end:  \r\nThe nurse at the 24 hour Coronavirus assessment unit, who sympathetically received and professionally triaged my father.  \r\nThe unstoppable force that was my father’s social worker, who has always made it her mission to get things done and to help with good humour and a big heart.  \r\nGlasgow’s Golden Generation charity, who delivered us a free food package, donated by a supermarket, whilst we quarantined at home.  \r\nThe stranger and the neighbour who bought and delivered my dad’s favourite newspaper, giving him some normality in what was a very surreal time.  \r\nMy father’s GP, who was calm and kind and knew exactly what referral was needed to help us at home.  \r\nThe local pharmacists, who got to know my father and who did what they could to help us overcome the challenges.  \r\nThe women who were two of a kind and who, despite everything, pushed all constraints of time, and got my dad the adaptions and supplements he needed to stay at home safely, and maintain his sorely fought independence for just that little bit longer. They showed their compassion and patience in abundance.  \r\nThe doctor who called back from NHS24 and really listened when we noticed that my father had deteriorated.  \r\nThe over-worked but professional ambulance team, who kept their calm in the midst of mayhem and fear, and got my dad safely to the hospital.  \r\nThe mostly invisible acute admission team, that must have worked hard with my father and did everything they could to successfully stabilize him.  \r\nThe young doctors, who amongst doing critical work, took the time to call us and keep us informed.  \r\nThe newly qualified nurse in the receiving unit, who gave so much of the very little time she had to my dad. And the army of students, re-distributed staff and health care assistants who supported her.  \r\nThe young ARU doctor who, at the end of a shift, was kind, spoke honestly and answered all the questions, even the hard ones.  \r\nThe ARU consultant, who told us the truth but still managed to give hope.  \r\nThe porters who, despite new and ever-changing pressures, remained gentle and discreet.  \r\nThe male ward nurse who recognised that time was of the essence in fulfilling my father’s wishes, and who did what he could to prioritise them.  \r\nThe doctor who stayed with us and cared for my father, whilst he used all of his willpower and fortitude to make his last wishes concrete.  \r\nThe lawyers firm who moved fast and did everything in their power to make those same wishes a reality.  \r\nThe ward nurse with the multi-coloured hair clip, and the nightshift third generation nurse who shared with us, and really listened to and cared for my father.  \r\nThe healthcare assistants who carried out personal care, who gave him his last ever meal and cup of tea. They did what they could to keep his worried family calm and help them to feel grounded in what felt like a surreal hell.  \r\nThe cleaners who just took the time to smile at us, and who do an incredible job under the circumstances.  \r\nThe hospital security guards who did their job with kindness and understanding.  \r\nThe hospital cafe and shop workers who turned up, stayed open, and fed and caffeinated the person who stayed with my dad.  \r\nAnd finally, the palliative care nurse who had the name and calming demeanour of a saint. He really took the time to get to know my dad and used his expertise and skill to make sure my dad felt no pain, no anxiety and no fear as he slipped away from us.  \r\nEvery one of you mostly invisible people, and many more, still unmentioned, keep working when the rest of the world must hibernate. Every single one of you has a family of your own and yet somehow, every morning you make the decision to overcome your own inevitable fear in this unstable landscape. You leave the safety of your home and go out to help others who are in greater need. Those who are vulnerable, sick, infected, and sometimes, dying.  \r\nI hope the world really recognises what a heroic commute to work this is. Every single day.  \r\nWhen Thursday night comes I hope that people clap. I hope they bang pots, play music, even sing and dance. I hope they celebrate your sacrifice as loud as they can. Not because the government tells them to, and even in spite of whatever private thoughts they may have about who is to blame for all of this loss.  \r\nBecause those who bravely care and show love to others in this world at this time especially, deserve every single decibel of gratitude.  \r\nOn behalf of my father, thank you all.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-04-26T23:48:00.0566667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-04-27T14:59:34.857","readBy":[{"name":"Scottish Ambulance Service","count":19},{"name":"NHS 24","count":39},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2021)","count":1},{"name":"St. Andrews University ScotGEM Medical Students","count":2},{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":13},{"name":"Scottish Government","count":2},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":2},{"name":"University of Glasgow - School of Medicine, Dentistry and Nursing","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/758987","id":"758987"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/758987/responses","id":"758987"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/758987/healthservices","id":"758987"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/758987/tags","id":"758987"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/nhs24-111","id":"NHS24-111","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/scot-ambulance","id":"scot-ambulance","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sj9-general-practices","id":"sj9-general-practices","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sj9qe-300","id":"sj9qe-300","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sj9qe-304","id":"sj9qe-304","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sj9-south-glasgow-hospital-aru","id":"SJ9-south-glasgow-hospital-aru","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fear","id":"fear"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/worried","id":"worried"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/discreet","id":"discreet"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/expertise","id":"expertise"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gp","id":"GP"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helped","id":"helped"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kept%20informed","id":"kept informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/paramedics","id":"paramedics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professionalism","id":"professionalism"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/referral","id":"referral"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sympathy","id":"sympathy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/calm","id":"calm"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassion","id":"compassion"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gratitude","id":"gratitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hope","id":"Hope"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/patience","id":"patience"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid-19","id":"covid-19"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/759033","id":"759033"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/759036","id":"759036"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/759048","id":"759048"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/759064","id":"759064"}]},{"id":759029,"author":"Diagi9","authorRoleId":7,"authorRole":"a staff member posting for a carer/relative","title":"Kindness","body":"We are very grateful for all of the kindness shown by staff at John Taylor Hospice.

I suddenly began to suffer from prolonged heavy bleeding I attended the Women’s day clinic and was promptly admitted. They needed to stop the bleeding and investigated the root cause. All of which was complicated by the anticoagulant; the proven drugs and procedures could result in blood clots.  \r\nI was admitted to ward 208 Gynaecology. From my very first encounter with the team from the women’s clinic to the ward and through all the work they did to help me the information was clear precise and honest. I could ask any question and nothing was too much. They introduced themselves so I knew all their names and they treated me with dignity and respect - I was an emotional patient who was very wary about the procedures they had to perform. They make it clear that the treatment was lead by my tolerances and dealt with in a kind profession and just downright humane manner. It made for me a very distressing situation bearable and I cannot thank them all enough. The ward was clean the food was good and ALL staff were fabulous. PPE was hampering the way the Team wanted to deliver their care but they did so so well.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-04-27T18:40:38.1366667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-04-28T13:25:14.083","readBy":[{"name":"Office of Alexander Burnett, MSP for Aberdeenshire West","count":1},{"name":"NHS Grampian","count":4},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/759053","id":"759053"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/759053/responses","id":"759053"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/759053/healthservices","id":"759053"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/759053/tags","id":"759053"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/n101h_502","id":"N101H_502","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bleeding","id":"bleeding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood","id":"blood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/clean%20ward","id":"clean ward"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/drugs","id":"drugs"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/food","id":"food"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good","id":"good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gynaecology","id":"gynaecology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pulmonary","id":"pulmonary"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pulmonary%20embolism","id":"pulmonary embolism"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dignity","id":"Dignity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ppe","id":"ppe"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/759104","id":"759104"}]}]
