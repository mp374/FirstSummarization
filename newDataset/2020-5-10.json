[{"id":768729,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Swift diagnosis and fantastic specialist services ","body":"Late last year was referred to the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital  for ongoing, but not severe, symptoms.  After a thorough examination the neurologist seemed reassured there were no underlying conditions but responded to our concerns by referring me for a brain scan, “to put your mind at rest”.\n\nI was telephoned within a week of the scan by a consultant who told me I had a benign meningioma; I was given an appointment at clinic the following day and an immediate referral to Addenbrookes Hospital, being seen within the next two days. The tumour was removed at Addenbrookes on 7th January and I initially recovered well and was discharged after a week.  However an infection necessitated a re-admission to Addenbrookes with 3-4 days of intensive investigations to ascertain the reason for my rapidly deteriorating condition. A further operation on 16th February found infected matter and over the course of the following week the precise antibiotic regime was established and I began to stabilise. In total I spent nearly 4 weeks this year at Addenbrookes, on Wards A3/A4. The treatment I received was second to none, and the care of the staff at all times was considerate and patient. The generous visiting hours enable patients to be fully supported by family which we found hugely beneficial.\nPlease pass on my appreciation to everyone on the neurology team, and to all the staff on the Wards.  And to you, and the executives for leading a good hospital with ground-breaking research and treatment initiatives.  I have been very fortunate to have had such good treatment and I know I am not alone.\n","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-05-09T17:32:47","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-05-10T06:13:43","readBy":[{"name":"Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/768729","id":"768729"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/768729/responses","id":"768729"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/768729/healthservices","id":"768729"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/768729/tags","id":"768729"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rgt01","id":"RGT01","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/alone","id":"alone"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/brain","id":"brain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/brain%20scan","id":"brain scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fortunate","id":"fortunate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good","id":"good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/infected","id":"infected"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/infection","id":"infection"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/meningioma","id":"meningioma"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/neurology","id":"neurology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/operation","id":"operation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scan","id":"scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tumour","id":"Tumour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appreciation","id":"appreciation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported","id":"supported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/769247","id":"769247"}]},{"id":768730,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Constant problems with dispensary","body":"Vast improvement now that you fill in a form to request a ring back. Previously it was nigh on impossible to get through by phone. However, once you have seen the doctor and been prescribed medicine, you problems really do begin. Unlike any other surgery I know, prescriptions go through the dispensary rather than straight to your chosen pharmacy. Repeat prescriptions must also be submitted to the dispensary to be signed off. This is when your repeat prescription will quite often vanish, leaving you, me and many others regularly having to chase up vital medicines. It is stressful and completely unnecessary. There is no appetite to change or improve this situation despite being ongoing for years. Even the doctor rolled his eyes when I spoke to him about it, which tells me that the Practice Manager is neither engaged nor cares a jot about efficiency or best practise. Also, avoid Lloyds Pharmacy. The combination of them and the dispensary will drive you to tears. I await a repeat prescription now that was requested nearly 2 weeks ago, for vital drugs that I will run out of very soon. I wonder if the form I filled in (the only means of communication with the dispensary) will even make a difference. We need another surgery in Attleborough soon. I'd be rattling their doors to transfer. I expect the manager will now tell me how happy patients are in surveys and what a marvellous team the dispensary is. I'm afraid your reputation says otherwise and everyone knows it. It's a shame you don't try to do anything about it.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-05-09T19:44:45","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-05-10T06:16:18","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/768730","id":"768730"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/768730/responses","id":"768730"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/768730/healthservices","id":"768730"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/768730/tags","id":"768730"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/d82034","id":"D82034","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/afraid","id":"afraid"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/drugs","id":"drugs"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/eyes","id":"eyes"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pharmacy","id":"Pharmacy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happy","id":"happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/marvellous","id":"marvellous"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/802225","id":"802225"}]},{"id":768732,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"No knowledge of Poly Myositis ","body":"I came in for an MRI scan.

No strength in the core muscles top of legs hips or top of arms.\nShe eventually picked my legs up onto the bed after I asked for help but in doing so I fell backwards which caused my neck to kick back without support. I felt vulnerable as she told me to “move down” on the bed again something difficult with no strength.\nShe gave me headphones but did not communicate with me during the scan until the end telling me I had 6 minutes left and I was doing well. \nAs I was extremely nervous which she was told she gave no reassurance to me and I was crying as I laid there. I had suffered a panic attack previously in the scanner.\nAfter the “ordeal” was finished she did not attempt to assist me to get off the bed again until I asked for help and from that..l I was told the entrance was “over there” and as I could not put my shoes on by myself there was no attempt to help me. No one supported me up the corridor back to the waiting room or checked that I was safe as I was shaking and upset. \nThe fact of having this scan is traumatic enough but surely staff should be aware of certain conditions that may need them to help more sympathetically and support patients. Also to put patients more at ease ?\nI am grateful for this lady working during the pandemic and have utmost praise for all NHS staff. I realise it could be skeleton staff in the department but I am just feeding back that certain conditions need more assistance rather than the unsympathetic person I encountered. \nIf I return I will make my needs clearer and if I am unhappy I won’t be returning to Southmead and will choose a different hospital. \nI will also be feeding back to my consultant in Rheumatology. \nIt has upset and hurt me (when the website states I would be SUPPORTED during the scan.)\nA pleasant lady took details as I first went in but she was not around as I came out? \nMaybe it was not the Radiographer’s job description to give more care but in the absence of a nurse she could have assisted me asked if I was ok as I staggered out with my shoes untied and could have fallen. \n\n","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-05-10T00:07:53","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-05-10T06:20:36","readBy":[{"name":"North Bristol NHS Trust","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/768732","id":"768732"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/768732/responses","id":"768732"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/768732/healthservices","id":"768732"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/768732/tags","id":"768732"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rvj01","id":"RVJ01","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nervous","id":"nervous"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/traumatic","id":"traumatic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20upset","id":"very upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/arms","id":"arms"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/legs","id":"legs"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mri","id":"mri"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mri%20scan","id":"MRI scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/neck","id":"neck"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/panic","id":"panic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/panic%20attack","id":"panic attack"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/rheumatology","id":"rheumatology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/safe","id":"safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scan","id":"scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unhappy","id":"unhappy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vulnerable","id":"vulnerable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported","id":"supported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20ease","id":"at ease"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staggered","id":"staggered"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/769248","id":"769248"}]},{"id":768731,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Very supportive","body":"I was referred for a 14 day cancer appointment I have to say everything went really smoothly I was contacted within the 14 days and had my first appointment after seven days everything was completed within the 14 days.\nI have to say I saw more cleaners than I did patients.

There was no rush with the appointment which lasted over an hour . I was given the option of having an internal examination. It was such a relief to meet a professional who takes this condition seriously and sympathetically. Vaginal dryness is a taboo subject for many and it can be a very embarrassing and awkward to discuss.  My appointment included how to do pelvic floor exercises correctly.  In addition the physio eased my fears about using vaginal oestrogen and also recommended that I try a vaginal moisturiser.  At the end of my appointment I was given a handwritten summary of all that we discussed.  Soon after my appointment I was prescribed the items recommended.  I think the service and support I received  is really valuable and has helped me emotionally and physically and improved my inter personal relationship with my husband. please can you pass on my thanks to the physio I saw at Heaton Norris.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-05-10T15:14:45","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-05-10T15:28:32","readBy":[{"name":"Stockport NHS Foundation Trust","count":3}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/768741","id":"768741"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/768741/responses","id":"768741"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/768741/healthservices","id":"768741"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/768741/tags","id":"768741"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rwj09","id":"RWJ09","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/continence","id":"continence"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helped","id":"helped"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/included","id":"included"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/internal%20examination","id":"internal examination"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pelvic","id":"pelvic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pelvic%20floor","id":"pelvic floor"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/physio","id":"physio"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/prolapse","id":"prolapse"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vaginal","id":"vaginal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/feel%20at%20ease","id":"feel at ease"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20ease","id":"at ease"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thanks","id":"thanks"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/769550","id":"769550"}]},{"id":768744,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Very caring ","body":"I was admitted as an emergency into Good Hope Ward 16  after suffering burst appendix also was Covid Positive but showing no symptoms, I was in so much pain, the Staff on the Ward was very caring and understanding and dealt with my pain until my Operation, post Op I was again monitored and checked very frequently and felt reassured about everything, I was in patient for three days and felt very grateful to be going home and very appreciative and thankful to the Staff who looked after me.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-05-10T17:37:09","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-05-10T18:04:05","readBy":[{"name":"University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust","count":2}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/768744","id":"768744"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/768744/responses","id":"768744"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/768744/healthservices","id":"768744"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/768744/tags","id":"768744"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rrk98","id":"RRK98","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appendix","id":"appendix"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency","id":"emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good","id":"good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/operation","id":"operation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appreciative","id":"appreciative"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hope","id":"Hope"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thankful","id":"Thankful"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/769604","id":"769604"}]},{"id":768746,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"A ship without a.captain","body":"Our mam was in this home for 16 months .

Yes, Sunbury Health Centre has had its issues, but anyone can see the strides they’ve made in improving, throughout all areas of service delivery. No system is perfect when having to cater for a wide reaching community, but I am so grateful to the Doctors, Nurses and Support staff that continue to serve us in tough and uncertain times. The partners, management and stake holders have increased staffing levels in reception, taken on more support staff to assist with enquiries, to free up doctors and nursing staff to focus on patient care. They have taken on board all the feedback provided by the extended community and have worked tirelessly to address our concerns. Life is challenging and stressful and illness and injury can have life threatening and life changing implications that make it difficult to be cheerful. But with us as grateful patients, who let’s not forget, need this practice, along with the understanding from and towards all practice staff, a fine balance can hopefully be met. Philosophy says, “Empathy has an amazing power for social change. We never really know what’s going on for others and won’t even begin to understand a person until we’ve walked a mile in their shoes.” So maybe we can give each other a thought and that consideration when we next feel aggrieved, angered, upset or hurt by someone. To end, I’d like to say thank you to all the staff at Sunbury Health Centre, for your contribution towards making it a practice that, I am for one, immensely proud of.

The midwives (and student midwives) were absolutely amazing - attentive, compassionate and so kind and reassuring throughout a 24 hour labour which spanned 2 shifts! \n\n I was very anxious due to a history of miscarriage and the midwives were fantastic in their responses - I could not have asked for better care. They put me on a monitor so I could hear the baby's heartbeat at all times and were constantly reassuring and encouraging - I am in awe of them and could not be more grateful for the care I received.\n\n I ended up being taken to theatre after my baby turned during labour - this terrified me but was handled calmly and with flawless expertise and competence. Everyone I met worked seamlessly together to deliver my baby safely and I felt so safe in their hands.  Looking back it was all a bit traumatic as I lost a lot of blood but the calmness and care of the team meant that this didn't impact upon the joy of hearing that long-awaited cry and being able to hold our rainbow baby at last.\nPostnatal care continued to be outstanding - due to the blood loss I had one-to-one care and a private room for the first 24 hours which was amazing and really helped me as a first time mum to get the hang of breast-feeding and for my son to be thoroughly checked over. I was then moved to the ward where the staff continued to be supportive and caring, despite being extremely busy. We received many regular visits from midwives/nurses/doctors/physios - the standard of care was truly first rate! Since returning home this has continued and I am still being supported in my recovery with regular contact and swift referrals being made. Particularly given that the country went into lockdown in the week following the birth this kind of support has been invaluable.\n\nI cannot praise St Mary's highly enough or thank them enough for helping me to become a parent when at times this seemed an impossible dream.

But today I need it as I am bitter. That was what I wanted, like my first birth : no bath birth, no jazz music, not a special position or special wishes.... just an epidural. Like for my first child I had to be induced... The pain when you are induced is stronger as contractions are so close they give you no rest! The first birth I gave in france was a dream to me! In England they told me write your birth plan in front of your book! That's the only thing I wrote : please give me an epidural!  \r\nI didn't have any, my midwife as soon as I came in the room, I asked for the epidural... I knew it was gonna quickly be very painful, I asked it like I did in France when I entered the labour room.  \r\nThe midwife ignored me... I cant even remember what she said... something vague... basically I had to wait ... see how it would go. When I explained I was french and in France we easily have it... she just said : things are different in here. Then I felt ignored and I started to get scared.  \r\nThey gave me the gas.. I started to be in unbearable pain an hour later and insisted but the anestesist is busy.. there was always a reason... came after a few hours I cried to see them so much...my happiness was short... there wasn't time to give me epidural... was then called for an emergency. Now I will never forget that feeling : anaesthetist is gone... I felt like being on a torture table... 5 of my nails have been taken I have an other five to go... the anesthesia will not come... I begged my husband to find a solution someone to listen to me ... he was powerless.  \r\nEverything accelerate, the rhythm of the baby’s heart rate drops... emergency C-section...I go in the theatre... but baby too engaged I have to push! I pushed .... as much as I possibly could... nothing...head of the baby stuck backward... They have to use a ventouse, have to have a horse episiotomy... and there he is! At 11pm my son is born.  \r\n... Now this is the last part I wont forget... the midwife tells me : « YOUR PUSHING WAS RUBBISH » thank you ...really for this moment !  \r\nI came into the post-birth ward..had to stay there one week as the episiotomy got infected... I have seen so many women coming there so happy cuddling and thanking their midwife...  \r\nRecently read an article about how some maternity in england try and avoid to give the epidural...  \r\nWhatever the reason are believe me they are not good enough to replace the post-traumatic birth I have lived and this feeling to not be listened to for something so important! I am angry and it has been 9 months  \r\nI have to say people were really nice in the post-birth section... they have seen me miserable and crying for days and told me to write a review... I never found the strength... hopefully doing this now will help me to forget and forgive.  \r\n","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-05-06T09:51:43.16","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-05-11T10:08:39.987","readBy":[{"name":"Frimley Health NHS Foundation Trust","count":1},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2020)","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/768394","id":"768394"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/768394/responses","id":"768394"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/768394/healthservices","id":"768394"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/768394/tags","id":"768394"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rdu50-maternity","id":"rdu50-maternity","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/angry","id":"angry"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ignored","id":"ignored"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scared","id":"scared"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/should%20listen","id":"Should listen"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/traumatic","id":"traumatic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/birth","id":"birth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/birth%20plan","id":"birth plan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/contractions","id":"contractions"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/epidural","id":"epidural"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/episiotomy","id":"episiotomy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/labour","id":"labour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/maternity","id":"maternity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/midwife","id":"midwife"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain%20relief","id":"pain relief"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/powerless","id":"powerless"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attitude","id":"staff attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/torture","id":"torture"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ventouse","id":"ventouse"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ward%20staff","id":"ward staff"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/768873","id":"768873"}]},{"id":768398,"author":"Onlywayisup","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Crisis team are fantastic","body":"After 2 suicide attempts and self harming, the crisis team came to ky house daily to start with and delivered my medication weekly so I hadnt enough medication to attempt another overdose with.

When I was ready for the labour suite Joan came and collected me to take me through and get me comfortable. I took great comfort in her care and seemed familiar with her face as I think she helped deliver my first baby back in 2011! Her nature was very relaxed, friendly yet professional. She took great care of me and also made sure my birthing partners were looked after. I was gutted when her shift finished! Once baby boy arrived and I was ready to move ward 17, I was looked after by Rachel, again she was friendly, professional and nothing was to much of a problem. It didn’t matter how many times I pressed my buzzer she was quickly there to help. The whole experience was unforgettable but positive with thanks to a fantastic team!

I refused treatment, signed a self discharge and am fine at home.  \r\nIn short, marvellous A&E doctor and nurses, excellent nursing care throughout, but doctors should listen to patients.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-05-08T09:04:24.3433333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-05-11T11:33:26.82","readBy":[{"name":"St. Andrews University ScotGEM Medical Students","count":1},{"name":"NHS Dumfries and Galloway","count":12},{"name":"Office of Finlay Carson, MSP for Galloway and West Dumfries","count":1},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/768666","id":"768666"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/768666/responses","id":"768666"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/768666/healthservices","id":"768666"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/768666/tags","id":"768666"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/y104h_180","id":"Y104H_180","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/y104h-cau","id":"y104h-cau","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/angry","id":"angry"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20listening","id":"not listening"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctor","id":"doctor"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/heart%20failure","id":"heart failure"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/most%20staff","id":"Most staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/noise%20at%20night","id":"noise at night"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nursing%20care","id":"nursing care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/a&e%20care","id":"A&E care"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/768860","id":"768860"}]},{"id":768842,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Superlative Service from Women’s Services-…","body":"From appointment making/confirmation, all done very quickly and within days of my own Dr’s referral, to a very polite & professional entry receptionist.

They lack knowledge on cross contamination and etiquette whilst dealing with patients. Laughing after mistakes that they caused (insensitive). Voicing their opinions on how they feel about patients is highly inappropriate there's a time and place to discuss matters and they were gossiping about me in their team I even heard one staff say “I don’t care you get the same treatment”. A staff nurse came out of a room and was communicating with another patient. He then saw me and instead of explaining anything he just said \"hey what's your name\" out loudly with no explanation, the treatment towards me was very poor. He then had a bad attitude and showed behaviours of being in a bad mood. I explained I had already done what he wanted to do he responded \"this is a different department quite abruptly\" he was so rude and unprofessional I was shocked that I was in a hospital, the level of service was poor. I would advise staff to attend training for customer care as it would be beneficial for the future. How you speak to patients, body language etc all needs to be professional at all times. Also the tone of voice for the person on front desk needs to be lower if the hospital was full everyone in there would know my full name, full address and reason I came in as they were asking questions so loudly. I've lost faith in the nhs. Also the doctor that I saw needs to listen instead of interrupting he didn’t want to listen to my history of medication just persisted on giving me a medication that is not suitable for me, no empathy was given. Going to the hospital was a waste of my time and made me lose trust and faith in the level of care provided.

When it came to the birth of our child, this continued. As someone who has never before been admitted to hospital, I was anxious when my birth plan for my first child (birth centre, water birth) changed a fortnight before my due date. I was to be induced. In the current climate, I also learnt that I would have to go through the majority of the process alone, without my birth partner, due to visitor restrictions. \nFrom arriving at the antenatal ward at lunchtime on a Tuesday, to leaving with my newborn on Thursday afternoon, the care we received from the staff was exemplary. The induction process was not an easy one, with the medication having too much of an effect and bringing on too many contractions. The antenatal staff acted quickly to move me to the labour ward as a result. I am grateful to the student midwife who held my hand and spoke to my partner on the phone, as I was very emotional by this point. Once there, I was mainly under the care of two professional, kind and caring midwives during my stay, who could not have been better. They really did go above and beyond - from providing refreshments and a bed for my partner, to setting up a starlight lamp when they heard that this was not the relaxed, birth centre birth I had had planned until very recently. I felt informed and supported throughout, even when the labour did not progress as planned and I was advised by the doctors that my baby may need to be born instrumentally, or even via c-section, which I had been desperate to avoid. \nThe surgical team put my mind at rest at a very anxious time, with one of the before mentioned midwives by my side, and a member of the surgical staff providing me much reassurance. The surgeon who delivered our baby using forceps kept me informed every step of the way, and delivered our baby quickly.\nWe cannot thank the staff who cared for us during this time enough. We are grateful that they brought our baby into the world with such care and professionalism. We would not hesitate to use the department again, and we would recommend them to anyone.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-05-11T17:39:59","progress":"Story has a

During these worrying times we live in at the moment I think they do an amazing job looking after all the patients in difficult circumstances.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-05-12T08:15:39","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2020-05-12T08:20:25","readBy":[{"name":"Healthwatch Tameside","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/768902","id":"768902"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/768902/responses","id":"768902"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/768902/healthservices","id":"768902"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/768902/tags","id":"768902"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/p89013","id":"P89013","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/group","id":"group"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pharmacy","id":"Pharmacy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing","id":"amazing"}]},{"id":768682,"author":"JB87","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Miscarriage support from caring midwives","body":"I am currently going through medical management for an early missed miscarriage. I feel the need to give praise to the incredible staff at the scanning department and Rubislaw ward at AMH for being so lovely.  \r\nAt the end of April I had to attend Antenatal scanning for my dating scan on my own due to the pandemic. We didn’t have a clue how far along I was as this was a lovely surprise with it not happening after over 5 years of trying. I feel terrible because, given the terrible circumstances of our situation, I don’t remember anyone’s names despite everyone introducing themselves very professionally. I was seen at 1pm upstairs for my scan and the woman scanning me was so empathetic and apologetic as she explained ‘baby’ wasn’t growing as it should in comparison to my gestational sac. This was devastating and made all the more worse as my husband wasn’t there with me. She was so incredibly empathetic and they allowed me to leave via a side door so I didn’t t need to pass lots of people as I was visibly upset. They arranged a scan in Rubislaw a week later.I attended Rubislaw for my scan in the morning. Again, terribly upset that I had to walk that corridor on my own I began to cry. The midwife was so lovely (I’m so sorry I can’t remember her name) and apologised that she couldn’t give me a hug because of the pandemic. But her words were soothing and I already felt at ease. She undertook the scan with a doctor present and they explained what had happened in detail and I was able to ask questions. I was reassured that it was not my fault and that someone would speak to me about my options. I was taken through to the garden room which is beautiful and very calming. Another lovely midwife and student midwife came in to the garden room and they spoke very clearly about the options whilst reassuring me there was no rush to make my decision and I could return tomorrow after having some time to think to discuss further if I wished. The midwife couldn’t have been more caring and compassionate given my circumstances. I made the decision for medicine management and I was asked to return the next morning. The next morning I had the same midwife who made sure I was 100% sure about the decision before it was taken any further. Everything was explained to me again. I was given the medication, anti sickness and pain relief and given more pain relief for home. The midwife clearly explained what to expect and told me multiple times that if I had any concerns at all to not hesitate to contact them.I feel most upset that I can’t remember the midwives name as she was professional whilst also showing such care and compassion towards me. Even though we are struggling through this difficult situation, ALL the staff who have cared for me through the whole process have been incredible. I cannot thank them enough for all the reassurance, kind words, care, compassion and empathy shown towards me. Thank you to the scanning department and Rubislaw Ward from a very grateful patient.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-05-08T12:18:46.6633333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-05-12T10:09:57.187","readBy":[{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2020)","count":1},{"name":"NHS Grampian","count":3},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/768682","id":"768682"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/768682/responses","id":"768682"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/768682/healthservices","id":"768682"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/768682/tags","id":"768682"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/n161h_501","id":"N161H_501","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/antenatal","id":"antenatal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20about","id":"Cared about"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/midwives","id":"midwives"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/miscarriage","id":"miscarriage"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scan","id":"scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20for","id":"cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassion","id":"compassion"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassionate","id":"compassionate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/empathetic","id":"empathetic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassuring","id":"reassuring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/explanations","id":"explanations"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20ease","id":"at ease"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/768928","id":"768928"}]},{"id":768703,"author":"Jester","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Aberdeen Maternity Triage Team","body":"I have attended triage a few times now at the Maternity Hospital and the team are very friendly, thorough and put you at ease.

Lorna was the most supportive, helpful and incredibly kind midwife we could have asked for. She visited at home which also made me feel a lot more relaxed and meant I didn't need to worry about childcare. It was also Lorna who visited me at home after I had my baby and the continuity was very much appreciated and again made me feel more relaxed as I already had a relationship with her, so no question felt like a stupid question. It was also reassuring as being in lockdown and anxious about covid 19, it meant only one health care staff member in my house, rather than different people on each visit.  \r\nDuring labour we were cared for by Debi and Kelli and both of them were amazing. I had a very quick labour and they were both so calm and supportive throughout and I can't thank them enough for delivering my little baby girl. Debi looked after me before and after I gave birth as well and was so helpful and reassuring, especially in the current circumstances whereby my husband could only stay a short time after delivery.  \r\nOther staff who helped whilst I was in hospital and I want to thank include: Jacqueline (triage midwife who was so understanding when I went in), Christine (Labour ward who induced me), Erin (student who looked after me in labour ward after delivery and was so patient with all my questions! ).","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-05-10T05:04:55.56","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-05-12T13:23:47.107","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":7},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/768728","id":"768728"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/768728/responses","id":"768728"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/768728/healthservices","id":"768728"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/768728/tags","id":"768728"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/c418h_501","id":"C418H_501","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/birth","id":"birth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20about","id":"Cared about"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/continuity","id":"continuity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/delivery","id":"delivery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helped","id":"helped"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/labour","id":"labour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/midwives","id":"midwives"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pregnancy","id":"pregnancy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supportive","id":"supportive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/triage","id":"triage"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing","id":"amazing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/calm","id":"calm"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20for","id":"cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassuring","id":"reassuring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/relaxed","id":"relaxed"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/768976","id":"768976"}]},{"id":768735,"author":"RI90","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Induction during COVID 19","body":"I was in for an induction at Wishaw general hospital on Wednesday night for my second baby and I just wanted to leave this here not only to highlight the work of the staff but for any other expectant mothers that may be nervous about going into a hospital to have their baby to try and put them at ease.  \r\nWhen I arrived I was shown to a 4 bed ward that was to be shared between two of us but I was then moved to a single room where there were staff available to start off my induction process while the other woman in my ward was being assessed. I subsequently stayed in this single room for my whole induction and labour. Firstly all of the midwifery staff that were looking after my needs were absolutely fantastic with several apologising for having to wear masks. All of the staff took it so seriously and took it all in their stride. I want to give a particular thank you to Lorna and Anne along with the two student midwives who were working alongside them Darcey and Emma. Lorna and Darcey helped me massively through the beginning of the induction process and immediately put my mind at ease. On the change of shift Anne and Emma helped me through the remainder to the birth of my baby. I unfortunately had a bit of a difficult labour and was nearly taken to theatre to allow me to deliver my baby and if it hadn’t been for Anne and Emma and the doctor Hilary that came in to help I wouldn’t have managed to deliver my baby myself without the need for any instruments.  \r\nMy whole experience, while I wasn’t expecting a negative experience I was unsure of what my care would be like due to COVID 19, ended up being such a positive and wonderful experience for me and it is all down to the extra care and professionalism shown by all of the midwifery staff and I can’t thank everyone enough for making my memories of this birth into something positive.  \r\nMy husband while not allowed in for the beginning of the induction was allowed in after my waters were broken and up to 6 hours after our baby boy was born which gave him a chance to bond with our baby before me and baby got discharged from hospital.  \r\nA massive thank you again to all of the maternity staff at Wishaw general hospital for such a wonderful experience.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-05-10T08:08:05.4166667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-05-12T13:26:07.097","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lanarkshire","count":6},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/768735","id":"768735"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/768735/responses","id":"768735"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/768735/healthservices","id":"768735"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/768735/tags","id":"768735"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l308h_501","id":"L308H_501","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/birth","id":"birth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/experience","id":"experience"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helped","id":"helped"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/induction","id":"induction"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/induction%20of%20labour","id":"Induction of labour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/looked%20after","id":"looked after"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/maternity","id":"maternity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/midwives","id":"midwives"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thankful","id":"Thankful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20ease","id":"at ease"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/769015","id":"769015"}]}]
