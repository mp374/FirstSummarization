[{"id":1060837,"author":"Nemo2023","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Training needed for maternity staff","body":"I had a few issues while being induced for my first baby which I feel need to be addressed to make staff aware and get the training needed.  \r\nI had a pessary put in early in the morning and was lying on top of my bed after it, as need to wait half an hour before getting up. I didn’t have anything on my bottom half other than a small towel across me for modesty. The curtains were pulled over. The domestic first proceeded to just come in to clean around my bed. Never to ask if it was OK to come in first before entering. I was slightly annoyed but it wasn’t an issue as I would’ve let them in anyway. The domestic then proceeded to come back in and dust over my head where I was lying, which I thought anything could’ve fell on my head and I’m pretty sure it could’ve waited half an hour.  \r\nHowever, the part that bothered me the most was this time the domestic went straight out and left the curtain open where I’m in a 4-bedded ward, and I then had to get up with nothing on but this towel and try to hold this towel and pull a curtain over with other patients and their partners in the room. The bed next to me actually had a new couple arrive at this moment I had to shut the curtain. I was really not happy with this, as know that dignity is one of the first things drummed in to all members of staff when starting. This seems to me like someone who has maybe worked there for a long time and became a bit more relaxed with that, to the point that they don’t even bother.  \r\nI did find the domestic's attitude terrible, specifically with me for some reason, as I hadn’t done anything to this person and didn’t know them beforehand. I also had an incident where I had went for a shower that morning and heard them say to their colleague very loudly that they had to go back in and clean the bathroom because I had been for a shower and brushed my teeth! This seemed to be aimed specifically at me. Now, I can assure you I never left any mess in that bathroom other than it being wet, and is that not what a bathroom is for?  \r\nI had been there for 4 days by this point, so whether it was because I was there for so long that it was directed at me I don’t know. As i said, they've maybe worked there for that long that they don't bother now, but I don't think it’s acceptable and should be made aware that it’s not OK and how it made me feel.  \r\nThe other issue I had that really upset me while there happened after having my 4th pessary that morning and due to the codeine I had for pain relief I became constipated. After trying other things it was recommended I have an enema. Unfortunately, a major incident happened in labour ward that day which took all the doctors to there, so as a result I ended up waiting 6 and a half hours before someone could sign for this enema to be given. Surely that should be looked at for one of the midwives to be able to do as that was a long time to wait in pain and discomfort. I understand that it was unusual circumstances, however having someone else be able to sign off on it would’ve been beneficial. They’re able to give morphine etc, so why not an enema?  \r\nHowever, that’s not the worst part regarding the enema situation. It eventually got signed off for me to get and was given the enema by one of the midwives, but they don’t administer it?! So I was expected as a 39-week pregnant woman to lie on my side and insert it myself! It was impossible to do and not only that but once again I was in a 4-bedded ward with other partners there and would need to do the dash across the room to the bathroom and hope no one else was in at the time.  \r\nAs a result, I had to go to the big bathroom along the corridor and lie on the floor and ask my partner to give me the enema. I cannot express to you how upsetting this was. I broke my heart like I’ve never broke my heart before to have to have your partner do something like this. Now as far as I’m aware, there’s risks with giving enemas and probably why they need signed off and is why staff have training on giving them. This is probably why the midwives don’t do them, as they haven’t had the training, but patients are expected to give them theirselves?!  \r\nAs I said, this was devastating for me and that’s coming from someone who has worked in the care industry and currently works for the NHS, so has a bit more confidence around intimate things. However, imagine if that had been a young 18-year-old girl who might’ve been on her own or a partner that wouldn’t do something like that. I don't think that’s right! I badly needed the enema, as was so uncomfortable, and it also held up the pessary process as I couldn’t get examined.  \r\nThis is not to flag up a specific member of staff, but there is clearly training needed to have the midwives able to administer the enema for patients as I’m sure I’m not the first nor the last to get constipated.  \r\nThese were the main issues I had that contributed to a very emotionally stressful experience for my first time giving birth. I don’t fault the midwives at all, but I did not have a nice experience of the whole thing and glad that it’s over.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-05-02T11:24:08.5433333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-05-05T07:14:13.06","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Ayrshire & Arran","count":10}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1060837","id":"1060837"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1060837/responses","id":"1060837"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1060837/healthservices","id":"1060837"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1060837/tags","id":"1060837"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/a111h_501","id":"A111H_501","score":3},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/annoyed","id":"annoyed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stress","id":"stress"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emotional","id":"emotional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/enema","id":"enema"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/giving%20birth","id":"giving birth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/induction","id":"induction"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/maternity","id":"maternity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pessary","id":"pessary"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pregnant","id":"pregnant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attitude","id":"staff attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/training","id":"training"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dignity","id":"Dignity"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1062219","id":"1062219"}]},{"id":1060857,"author":"ospreysx69","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"The care and treatment I received on each visit was first class","body":"I had cause to attend the treatment room at Coatbridge Health Centre on 4 occasions in April.  \r\nThe care and treatment I received on each visit was first class.  \r\nNo waiting time and the care I got from the nurses was compassionate and professional.  \r\nI would have no hesitation in contacting them again if required.  \r\nThank you.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-05-02T12:18:16.4666667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-05-05T07:20:03.827","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lanarkshire","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1060857","id":"1060857"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1060857/responses","id":"1060857"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1060857/healthservices","id":"1060857"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1060857/tags","id":"1060857"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sl9-gp","id":"sl9-gp","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gp%20surgery","id":"gp surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/head","id":"head"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/level%20of%20care","id":"level of care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professional","id":"professional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting%20time","id":"waiting time"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wound","id":"wound"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassionate","id":"compassionate"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1064324","id":"1064324"}]},{"id":1060895,"author":"Subo56","authorRoleId":1,"authorRole":"a carer","title":"My Angels in Blue who turned both our lives around","body":"The person I care for had a stroke in August 2022, and our lives changed overnight.

By then she was unable to walk or even stand at all.  \r\nShe spent the whole of that day in A&E on a chair in the waiting area, and that night on a chair in the corridor, and the next day on a trolley in a cubicle.  \r\nShe was eventually moved to a ward (Eleanor ward.) The nurse phoned to say Mum had fallen in the ward. Finally (it appears) her x-rays were checked and fracture diagnosed. The previous x-rays were reviewed and a hairline fracture detected (from 3 weeks previously).  \r\nSurgery performed, but but due to damage caused by so many falls, a normal hip replacement could not be performed, and so a girdle stone procedure was done. Moved to Cedar orthopaedic ward  \r\nOver the next 3 weeks Mum got Covid, (and was moved to Willow ward), C Diff, and multiple UTI’s, so no physiotherapy was given.  \r\nShe was then moved to Danetre Hospital for intensive physio. Built up shoe supplied.  \r\nMum is currently still there, but not physically able to come home. She has no mobility at all.

When I called I got through to reception after a bit of a wait and was given an appointment the next morning at 9 am.  \r\nI saw Dr Berry from Kingsway medical Practice in Glasgow. Her care could not have been better! She listened, asked what I thought, treated me with interest, kindness and compassion. She looked things up and showed me online photographs which helped me to understand and feel confident about her diagnosis. She made a clear treatment plan with me and I knew what to do next if it improved or deteriorated. She also helped with a second issue I raised in the same helpful, efficient and inclusive way.

After spending some time in the admissions unit (service and care was also good here despite it being very busy, noisy, and the obvious lack of nurses) I was transferred to Ward 51 for an overnight stay for intravenous antibiotics.  \r\nThe ward was a world away from the admissions ward - it was modern, clean, and quiet. I had my own room and a greater choice of what to watch on TV than I have at home! The nurses on Ward 51 were professional, caring and quietly got on with their job. They went the extra mile to find me an ice pack for my foot and crept in quietly during the night to change my medication.  \r\nOnce the doctors were happy that I was not allergic to the new medicine they started to plan how to get me home whilst still requiring IV antibiotics. Thankfully I was accepted to attend the OPAT clinic - Outpatient Parenteral Antibiotic Therapy. What a wonderful model of care available to people in Fife.  \r\nThe OPAT team are amazing - my foot was actively monitored for change/improvement every day, the cannulas were inserted and changed without drama or pain, the nurses and doctors were friendly and professional and there was even time for some banter! And of course plenty of tea and biscuits while you receive your antibiotics always helps.  \r\nBut seriously, despite the overhead of travelling to the hospital every day, this model of care was perfect for my situation. I wasn't taking up a valuable bed, I felt supported, well cared for, and also had plenty of time for proper rest at home. The OPAT team are a credit to NHS Fife and I am very thankful for their care.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-05-02T14:59:57.4533333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-05-05T07:59:00.7","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Fife","count":5}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1060922","id":"1060922"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1060922/responses","id":"1060922"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1060922/healthservices","id":"1060922"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1060922/tags","id":"1060922"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/f704h_340","id":"F704H_340","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/f704h-admissions-1","id":"F704H-admissions-1","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/f704h-opat","id":"F704H-OPAT","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/allergic","id":"allergic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/antibiotics","id":"antibiotics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/caring","id":"caring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctors","id":"doctors"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/facilities","id":"facilities"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/infection","id":"infection"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/iv%20antibiotics","id":"iv antibiotics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professional","id":"professional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/well%20cared%20for","id":"well cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported","id":"supported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thankful","id":"Thankful"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1063148","id":"1063148"}]},{"id":1061215,"author":"Mah5678","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"This is a new life for me","body":"On my arrival to DCDS the staff were absolutely brilliant with me, they were very welcoming.

I also enjoyed NA and CA coming in as people had been through similar experiences.  \r\nIf you ever needed clean towels, they were supplied. If ever a problem, it was resolved straight away.

I felt very comfortable.  \r\nI felt very reassured when I first arrived, as the staff kept checking I was okay which really helped me.  \r\nI will be leaving here with so much positive thoughts and energy which I haven't had for about 3 years.

While in A&E we were introduced to the Hospital at Home scheme. The scheme was fully explained ie patient would return home, nurses would visit 3 times per day for the duration of the treatment to administer IV antibiotics as well as checking vital signs and taking samples for lab tests. In addition, there would be home visits from a doctor to monitor the patient’s progress. We returned home and treatment started.The whole process was fantastic. The nurses and doctor were professional, efficient and a breath of fresh air - all had an absolutely wonderful bedside manner. They explained every step and all the options available. They gave advice and left us feeling happy and confident. At all times we felt we were in safe hands. We also had a telephone number to call if we had any problems. Finally, we had a visit from the team Pharmacist who very helpfully went through all the patient’s medications to ensure everything was appropriate and given at the best times.The week passed without any issues.This is a fantastic service and a win-win. The hospital had a free bed and saved on 24 hour staff care and associated costs, while the patient had the appropriate treatment in the comfort of his own surroundings. Finally, the family was saved the time, cost and inconvenience of travelling to the hospital for limited visiting. We also knew at all times how our loved one was. This scheme should be more widely available. While there will always be a place for a hospital for emergency, acute and surgical intervention, I would never consider leaving anyone in a hospital bed if they could have this quality of appropriate treatment in the comfort of their own home.  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-05-02T17:13:41.3733333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-05-05T08:03:36.08","readBy":[{"name":"Western Health and Social Care Trust","count":8}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1060976","id":"1060976"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1060976/responses","id":"1060976"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1060976/healthservices","id":"1060976"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1060976/tags","id":"1060976"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt005-acute-care-at-home-hospital-at-home","id":"zt005-acute-care-at-home-hospital-at-home","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctors","id":"doctors"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/extend%20service","id":"extend service"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/iv%20antibiotics","id":"iv antibiotics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/more%20funding","id":"More funding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pharmacist","id":"pharmacist"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professional","id":"professional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/quality","id":"quality"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/signs","id":"signs"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tests","id":"tests"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20for","id":"cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fantastic","id":"fantastic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/valued","id":"valued"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/explanations","id":"explanations"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/service","id":"service"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1065812","id":"1065812"}]},{"id":1061662,"author":"angiewo","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Thanks to staff for getting me through","body":"After having a bad experience in the past I was petrified of having my eye injections again and I would like to thank ANDREW ( the injector !!) for giving me a PAINLESS INJECTION also Sarah, Janet and not forgetting Will who was observing for helping me through this ordeal.

From the time of diagnosis at colonoscopy , to finally having surgical removal of the tumour, after a lengthy wait of almost 4 weeks, my care has been empathetic and kind and communication very good. My inpatient care was excellent.  \r\nHowever, since discharge from hospital the communication has been woeful. I was told to expect results from the pathology at 10 -14 days post operatively . Two, and then almost 3 weeks went by with no word. No contact from the district nurses regarding my wounds occurred in spite of my making contact with them. I tried to ring the colorectal cancer nurse service but they were too busy to speak to me! Nobody touched base to ask how I was faring.  \r\nAt almost 3 weeks post op I finally received a phone call from the cancer nurse ( not the surgeon himself) . I now require chemotherapy. I requested information regarding timescales for this and was informed about the ‘targets ‘ that the cancer service works to. There seemed to be a complete disregard for the inevitable anxiety felt by a patient in this situation - fulfilling targets is the LAST thing on my mind - I am aware that the longer one waits for treatment the poorer the longer term outcomes. No empathy whatever from the CRC nurse I spoke to . In fact they became very short and spoke over me when I tried to ask questions.  \r\nI feel that especially when results are delayed that some communication from the team would take so little time, but have a huge impact on patient well being , and allay some of the inevitable anxiety that comes with such a diagnosis. I have been left feeling that I am just a number , and that as long as the targets for treatment are met that any attempt at holistic care is unnecessary . I hope that the team will reflect upon my experience and try to improve the care for other patients in similar circumstances.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-03-24T14:33:18.0733333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-05-05T08:11:22.843","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Forth Valley","count":6},{"name":"Scottish Government","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1046468","id":"1046468"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1046468/responses","id":"1046468"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1046468/healthservices","id":"1046468"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1046468/tags","id":"1046468"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/forth-valley-royal-general-surgery","id":"forth-valley-royal-general-surgery","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/forth-valley-royal-oncology","id":"forth-valley-royal-oncology","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/abandoned","id":"abandoned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cancer%20care","id":"cancer care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/colon%20cancer","id":"colon cancer"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diagnosis","id":"diagnosis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/district%20nurses","id":"district nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/empathy","id":"empathy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/follow%20up%20care","id":"Follow up care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/inpatient%20care","id":"inpatient care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attitude","id":"staff attitude"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1062253","id":"1062253"}]},{"id":1061192,"author":"castorfh77","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"timely, friendly and compassionate care","body":"I attended the radiology department for an ultrasound scan at Omagh Hospital.

All the internal exams were just behind a curtain in the bay of the busy ward.  \r\nIn labour ward I had another midwife who seemed very junior and stood in the corner gossiping with their student most of the time. The rest of the time they just watched the monitor and baby heart trace and didn't seem interested in supporting you at all. Advised not to have any pain relief yet, even though my pain was terrible. Not sure if this poor support is because of staffing there, but the midwifes were really not supportive or caring and we were really disappointed with the experience.

I also received a call confirming the appointment. Then yesterday I  received a pre-appointment/pre assessment call, to further prepare me, check on my child and allow me to answer questions, they also directed me to a video link to watch with my child to help prepare her for the visit. \nToday,on arrival, we was greeted and talked through the whole process again, explained the routine and given a clean and comfy cubicle with a bed to wait in. \nThere was also a lovely open planned play area being lead by a play coordinator, who actively went from bed to bed and used props to demonstrate to the children the procedure in a very child friendly way; she also had sticker charts to map out each part of their journey with them as the complete it. Honestly this lady was everywhere you looked, reaching each child and parent and yet somehow gave each child so much attention.\nThen there was a barrage of incredible nurses, who were very present, warm, approachable and fluent in the language of child. They had such a good system between them, they did not miss a beat in the care given. \nThen to top it all off, the Doctor doing the Anaesthetic popped down to meet everyone individually and discuss the process, the options and to answer any questions. When my daughter fell asleep just before Anaesthetic was due, he quickly reassessed the plan to decide how best not to disturb her sleep to minimise distress. Again there was a whole team of keen and willing people in that department too, also all very present and helpful. \nI was sent for promptly when my child came out of the MRI so she didn’t wake up alone. \nOnce back on the ward, my daughter was observed continuously, and again the Anaesthetist popped in to check on her recovery. She was not rushed to wake up, but once awake she was offered food and drink and was only allowed home until they was entirely happy with her state. \nHonestly, wizard ward is smashing it. I can’t speak for the entire hospital, but since my daughter become a pedeatrics outpatient in January, she has been in a couple of times (she’s also stayed on phoenix ward) and she has received incredible care.

In my initial phone consultation, I specified that due to childcare, I couldn't attend anything until after 3pm. Despite that, they offered me a course at 11am and asked me to call if it worked. I did not call as it obviously didn't work. They then left me an answer machine message while I was on holiday (so they would have had international dial) offering me yet another course prior to 3pm. I didn't call back as I was on holiday, so the next day I got a text saying they were referring me back to the general practice because they'd tried to contact me \"several times\" despite the fact that no messages implied I must reply.\n\nI emailed them to stop them referring me back to the general practice and they claimed they'd also emailed me. I stated that I'd received zero emails and who were they emailing. That question was ignored, but I was put onto a 6pm course.\n\nI attended the first session this week and I was not impressed in the slightest and wish to explain why.\n\nThe reason for my referral is that I developed gestational diabetes which means you're more susceptible to diabetes when you're older.. In the course I attended, I was the only person there that this was the case for.\n\nIn this introductory session, we were informed that the aim over the course was to lose 5%-10% body fat and then they weighed everyone in the session to work out what that would be.\n\nThis on its own alarmed me. I am a clothing size 10 and not overweight in the slightest - someone needs to review these sessions as it cannot be a one size fits all.\n\nWe were then shown a food diary section, with a column for calories and whilst the lady said calories are not compulsory, I found it to be very triggering and encouraging a very unhealthy relationship with food.\n\nNext, we were told that we need to track our steps every day and whilst I'm on board with encouraging mobility, again I don't think bringing in a tracking obsession is healthy.\n\nSo in short - track my weight, track my calories and track my steps, which for the most part for me, encourages an unhealthy number obsession and it really upset me, especially when I absolutely do not need to lose weight.\n\nWe were also told of \"quick wins\" eg cut out alcohol- I don't drink. Cut down on red meat - I don't eat red meat etc etc.\n\nNot once were we asked about our wellbeing or how we felt about this in the session and to top it off I was told I should have received an email on the sessions which I obviously didn't receive because admin is emailing an email that's not mine clearly.\n\nI raised this and was told someone would call me to rectify this. Today I got a text not a call that I cannot reply to telling me to check my spam mail which I found to be patronising. There is nothing in my spam and still nobody has asked me what my email even is.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2023-05-03T16:30:29","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2023-05-05T10:04:31","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1062325","id":"1062325"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1062325/responses","id":"1062325"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1062325/healthservices","id":"1062325"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1062325/tags","id":"1062325"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/dm9","id":"DM9","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ignored","id":"ignored"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20upset","id":"very upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/alarmed","id":"alarmed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/alcohol","id":"alcohol"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diabetes","id":"diabetes"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fits","id":"fits"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gestational%20diabetes","id":"gestational diabetes"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/informed","id":"informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mobility","id":"mobility"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20impressed","id":"not impressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/overweight","id":"overweight"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pregnancy","id":"pregnancy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/weight","id":"weight"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/impressed","id":"impressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wellbeing","id":"wellbeing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diabetes%20in%20pregnancy","id":"diabetes in pregnancy"}]},{"id":1061402,"author":"scasey200","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Recent day surgery admission","body":"I cannot describe how amazing the care has been today within the Day Surgery unit at RAH.

However, I can honestly sing the praises of all involved in my care today.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-05-03T12:41:31.64","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-05-05T10:04:51.537","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1061402","id":"1061402"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1061402/responses","id":"1061402"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1061402/healthservices","id":"1061402"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1061402/tags","id":"1061402"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/c418h-dsu","id":"C418H-dsu","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/day%20surgery","id":"day surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/well%20looked%20after","id":"well looked after"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing","id":"amazing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/comfortable","id":"comfortable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/smooth%20process","id":"smooth process"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1062394","id":"1062394"}]},{"id":1061452,"author":"aoiy23","authorRoleId":8,"authorRole":"a staff member posting for a patient/service user","title":"I was worried about my surgery but immediately eased","body":"I was worried about my surgery to remove cataracts, but it was immediately eased.

The beside manners and care he provided was above expectations and he really seemed to care about everything he does for a patient. He was prompt and got things done without delay to ensure I would be at ease. Sachin had to perform a procedure however as it was not successful was able to get the procedure done by calling the theatres to get the anaesthetist to have a go to ensure things would be done. I can’t thank Sachin enough for being exceptionally kind, caring and attentive to my needs whilst under his care in A&E. Furthermore, thank you for the A&E radiology team for taking care of one of their own staff members with care and dignity and constantly checking to ensure I was ok and if I needed anything. It was not nice to be the patient and not be working with you but I’ll be back to work soon and we can all have a laugh about how much of a mess I looked!  \r\nI was transferred to Crick ward later in the evening and I was left in the caring hands of Kerry who was my night shift nurse. She put me at ease with her calming personality and reassured me I can call if I need anything at all. She was in and out of the room the whole right doing observations and providing medication that I needed. Kerry made my evenings feel relaxed and safe when visitors were no longer allowed to be there. During the day in Crick I had a nurse called Dana. I have to say Dana, you really made me feel better and better about myself. You made not only me laugh but my mum and sister by being hilarious and making things a little lighter. I told anyone that came that I had the best nurse so far looking after me and they saw I felt a little more positive and had a smile on my face even though I was in a lot of pain still. Dana please carry on being yourself, you make a massive difference in a patients day in the hospital and you truly are an amazing human. Also shoutout to Michael who was coming in and out of the room during the day to do my observations alongside Dana - he was another individual who cares and tries to make his patient smile, a great asset to the team.  \r\nFinally I ended up in Elgar ward on Sunday evening as I tested positive for Covid to my surprise. I had a lovely nurse in the evening although I have forgotten her name I think it was possibly Kristinna - a kind and lovely nurse who made sure I was settled in as I was transferred late night to Elgar ward. My day nurse Dave who looked after me during 2 day shifts was great. Attentive to my needs and ensured I was comfortable. He got my medication for me on time and tried to give best knowledge where possible and got doctors when I had a concern about my discharge plan. A big thank you to Premila who is the ward clerk who has arranged a follow up appointment for me to see the team in the outpatient clinic and also for being smiley face which is great when you are feeling a little low.  \r\nOverall a massive thank you to everyone who has been part of my care in Northwick Park. I am home recovering now and look forward to returning to work and being part of another patients journey through our hospital.  \r\n","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-05-03T13:42:27.9966667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-05-05T10:10:04.333","readBy":[{"name":"London North West University Healthcare NHS Trust","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1061424","id":"1061424"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1061424/responses","id":"1061424"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1061424/healthservices","id":"1061424"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1061424/tags","id":"1061424"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/r1k01_180","id":"R1K01_180","score":4},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/r1k01_350","id":"R1K01_350","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/attentive","id":"attentive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/calming","id":"calming"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/caring","id":"caring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctors","id":"doctors"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good%20care","id":"good care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kind","id":"kind"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kind%20staff","id":"kind staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/laughter","id":"Laughter"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/meningitis","id":"meningitis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/radiology","id":"radiology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassurance","id":"reassurance"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dignity","id":"Dignity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%2019","id":"covid 19"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/radiology%20team","id":"radiology team"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20well%20looked%20after%20and%20safe","id":"very well looked after and safe"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1063541","id":"1063541"}]},{"id":1062324,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Covid Clinic good experience ","body":"All the staff were incredibly helpful and friendly.

I was left again without pain meds which I need every day. It was sorted eventually but not after going over the bank holiday without them causing me a tremendous amount of pain. The ask first app also used to be good to use but again not lately. You can’t get an appointment for two weeks, this is useless when you need to see a gp asap. I have booked a face to face on there only to get to the surgery to be told it was a telephone consultation, which wasn’t the case. I see that the surgery says it’s still taking on new patients, it would be good if the patients you already have could rely on a service before taking on more new patients. There is one lady at the surgery that I can always rely on, she listens and sorts things out asap obviously it is harder to get an appointment with her but it is well worth it as long as it isn’t something urgent. It means if I can speak to her then I don’t have to keep explaining all my medical issues/ history as she knows me so well.
