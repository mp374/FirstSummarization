Since all three of us are high risk (even though my gp has not put me on the shielding list) we have been in full shielding since the beginning of March. My mother has had her first jab at home and at the time I asked the gp what would be happening for my sister and myself. I was told they didn't know as it would not be them dealing with it. However this turned out to be incorrect as they have just been to give my sister her first jab.  \r\nI again asked both on the phone and in person why I could not get my first jab at the same time and instead of trying to help me or understand why I am fighting to get protected as soon as possible (I can't get to the clinic as I am not well enough and on top of that if I get sick there is no one else to look after my family, they would both end up in state care and our dogs in a rescue centre, the worry that most non paid carers have had to deal with this past year is not just about trying to keep our loved ones safe but to keep ourselves safe because if we get sick there is more often than not no one else to look after them but no one in the health service seems to understand this), instead they just told me the same line 'we are following government guidelines and you aren't on the list'.  \r\nI phoned the health board and got the number for the vaccine booking line who were far more thoughtful and understanding than my gp practice has been and they have put me on the list to get a home visit from the district nurse, but they can't tell me how long it will take. The fact that people who are not trained doctors or health professionals showed me more understanding and consideration than my own gp practice has is shocking, I am perfectly ware they are working hard, but they are not the only ones who have been having a stressful time.  \r\nI have seen no consideration for non paid carers or even the attempt to understand what we have been going through or why we are desperate to get as protected as possible as soon as possible. It makes me feel uncared for, unimportant and disposable and I shouldn't feel any of those things when dealing with my gp practice in any way let alone during a pandemic.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-02-11T13:26:13.11","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2021-02-15T09:20:02.2","readBy":[{"name":"Office of Colin Smyth, MSP for South Scotland","count":1},{"name":"NHS Borders","count":3}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/821310","id":"821310"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/821310/responses","id":"821310"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/821310/healthservices","id":"821310"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/821310/tags","id":"821310"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sb9-community-services","id":"SB9-community-services","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sb9-gp","id":"SB9-GP","score":1},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/access%20to%20vaccines","id":"access to vaccines"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/alone","id":"alone"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/considerate","id":"considerate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/safe","id":"safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/understanding","id":"understanding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/loved","id":"loved"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pandemic","id":"pandemic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%20vaccine","id":"covid vaccine"}]},{"id":821366,"author":"CAMMY","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Wheelchair assessment","body":"On my assessment I was told that I would get a motorised wheelchair that was way back in Dec 2020  \r\nIs there any progress on the situation as of now ?","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-02-11T14:31:21.4633333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-02-15T09:20:02.497","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":6},{"name":"Scottish Government","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/821366","id":"821366"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/821366/responses","id":"821366"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/821366/healthservices","id":"821366"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/821366/tags","id":"821366"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sj9-westmarc-aa-powered","id":"sj9-westmarc-aa-powered","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kept%20informed","id":"kept informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting%20time","id":"waiting time"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/824271","id":"824271"}]},{"id":821695,"author":"Hezz","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Waiting Lists","body":"I have been on the waiting list to see a consultant since Dec 2018.

He was not pointing and had a regression in regards to giving any eye contact or answering to his name which were the first signs we wondered if something was wrong.  \r\nWe expressed our concerns to our Health Visitor who came to see our son and mentioned we think our son could be autistic. She was great at reviewing our son but agreed he 'failed' most of the assessments that she tried on him on a few separate visits (I think the only one that didn't come back concerning was the gross motor skills section) and said that she shared our concerns in thinking he is possibly autistic. He was seen by a GP who said she also thought it was likely he could be autistic.  \r\nHe was referred to SALT and OT who also share our concerns. He is non verbal at almost 2 years old and has a lot of sensory issues. He was referred to the pediatrician after his 1st birthday which unfortunately was declined at first by them mainly due to his age and I think taking a 'wait and see' approach having not have seen the SALT team etc for long enough. We felt very disappointed and deflated at this as the professionals listed above had all shared our concerns. We tried to push to still be on the waiting list as I knew this would be around a year long anyway. Disappointingly they asked that we re refer him when he was 18 months again.  \r\nWhen he turned 18 months we still had the same concerns if not more but the referral was accepted this time however we were told he would not be seen until he was 2.5yo (September 2021). Although we are happy his referral has now been accepted we are disappointed at how long we have to wait for him to be seen despite raising concerns after his 1st birthday. I feel that 1.5 years later is a long time to be without seeing a pediatrician. We have tried to phone the pediatrician a few times for advise for our son meantime as we keep being told that earlier intervention is best but we are struggling to ever get a response for them.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-02-12T11:20:13.0366667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-02-15T09:20:02.78","readBy":[{"name":"St. Andrews University ScotGEM Medical Students","count":1},{"name":"NHS Tayside","count":19}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/821977","id":"821977"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/821977/responses","id":"821977"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/821977/healthservices","id":"821977"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/821977/tags","id":"821977"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/st9-community-services-hv","id":"st9-community-services-hv","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/t202h","id":"T202H","score":2},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxious","id":"anxious"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disappointed","id":"disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/autism","id":"autism"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/autistic","id":"autistic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/child%20development","id":"child development"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/deflated","id":"deflated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/eye","id":"eye"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/health%20visitor","id":"health visitor"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/paediatric","id":"paediatric"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/section","id":"section"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/signs","id":"signs"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting%20list","id":"waiting list"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happy","id":"happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20disappointed","id":"very disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/access%20to%20specialist%20services","id":"access to specialist services"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20happy","id":"not happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/autism%20services","id":"autism services"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/824813","id":"824813"}]},{"id":821978,"author":"mumby84","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"First baby scan","body":"We visited Croydon hospital for our first pregnancy scan.  \r\nSadly our experience was ruined by a rude interaction with a receptionist and a nurse whos' service was poor.

I had a lot of nerves about receiving treatment and was concerned that I would be judged for my symptoms, however as soon as i entered the clinic I was immediately put at ease. The receptionist was very kind and made me feel at home, and the service had a very warm feeling to it. I was attending the clinic to receive rTMS treatment for which my Doctor at the Clinic prescribed and was well laid out to me before undertaking the treatment. When i arrived for my first few rTMS treatments the technician was very helpful and informed on any concerns that I had. He was able to ease my nerves about the treatment and I feel like he made the whole process much easier for me as he was the main person doing my treatments. During the treatments he stayed with me and made me feel reassured that everything was okay as well as giving me practical advice on how to get through the treatment. Since having my rTMS I have noticed a dramatic drop in my anxious and depressive symptoms and I am chosing to couple this with psychotherapy which I think will make me feel even better in the long run.

I've been to a few GP's from uni and moving around London who I haven't always enjoyed seeing, but I can safely say that every single interaction I have had at LHGP has been so warm, polite, friendly and professional: all the way from the receptionists to the nurses and doctors, they've all been wonderful. \n\nThey seem to have taken all COVID-19 secure changes during the pandemic in their stride, or at least don't make any stress that may going on behind the scenes of organising everything visible at all. \n\nI know that part of any NHS staff's role is to be understanding, polite and kind in their bedside manner, but LHGP just seem to go above and beyond that in every way that they have dealt with myself personally, and in the way that I have heard them speak to other patients in the waiting room etc. \n\nI feel very lucky to have them as my local practice, and thought it was important to share this. It's very easy to criticise at the moment, tensions are high and people seem to want to place blame where possible, but I don't think I could find fault with the wonderful team at LHGP even if I tried.

When I arrived I was amazed by the number of people outside and inside the surgery. Everything appeared to be running perfectly with those waiting for their jab and those having had it constantly entering and leaving the surgery. All the staff were good humoured, extremely pleasant and helpful in every way. From arrival at the surgery to leaving having had my jab and in possession of my vaccination card took no more than 10 minutes. Incredible when there were so many people there. The whole process was in my view astonishingly smooth and quite humbling to see the staff working so hard for us all in what must be difficult circumstances for them all.

When the ambulance crew Jane and Hannah arrived the assessment was completed so quickly. Jane immediately gave me more relief with an extra strap. I was in a very High Activation Positive Moodstate and having lots of flashbacks because of Complex PTSD which I have had untreated for 58 years but with Jane’s 20 years of paramedic experience she soon had a full understanding of the seriousness of my condition. I was also on antibiotics for my bladder and testicles. After checking blood pressure, etc., and putting all the information into an automated system Hannah set off without a blue light. That would have traumatised me further as I had been taken as an emergency in ambulances many times in very traumatic circumstances. A blue light would have precipitated very severe flashbacks so instead Jane and I had a very good laugh which brought my endorphins out and eased my emotional pain. When I arrived at the PRUH I was whisked into a cubicle and handed over to more OUTSTANDING Care, Compassion, Commitment, Competence, Communication and possibly above all Courage in the front Line of the battle against Covid.  \r\nTHANKS 🤩 so much Jane and Hannah.  \r\nI will write more tomorrow with details of the continued Outstanding treatment in casualty from everybody including and especially Tola who was working as part of a very efficient A&E team.
