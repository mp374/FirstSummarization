We'd never heard of this illness. She was 16 years old at the time of admission. She was intubated and sedated the following day and there began a 10 month journey we could've never imagined. A team of consultants, doctors, anaesthetist, nurse and family support dr met us on arrival and very clearly and considerately explained the diagnosis and treatment plan. We were left in no doubt that our daughters situation was very serious, she was extremely ill, and would be sedated for weeks but more likely months. This devastating news was delivered to us with with great care and consideration and all our questions were answered as much as possible. We then donned ppe and was allowed to sit with our daughter at the bedside for a limited time due to covid restrictions. Our heads were spinning with worry, it was massively stressful and as we were ending this visit an icu nurse came up to us and said something very important, she said, 'while your daughter is here with us, we will look after her like she is our little sister, we promise'. Our daughter was sedated for almost 3 months. There were many complications during this time, infections, blood clots, collapsed lung and an op to remove a faulty gland. We were only allowed a short bedside visit (fully ppe) once a week due to covid restrictions. Our daughters skin was always moisturised, her mouthcare was excellent, her hair was always washed (and styled) and she was always very clean and fresh. The nurses were absolute in their commitment and promise to us and cared for her with great dedication. They would always talk to her even though she was sedated and would sit and hold her hand when we couldn't. This level of care never dipped during all the time at mitu and as the weeks went by it reassured us and enabled us to eventually get some sleep at night. We were encouraged to call any time of the day or night and the nurse would always update us and hold the phone by her ear so we could talk and say goodnight. We were called daily by the consultant or doctor regarding treatments and progress updates and nothing was ever done without us being informed. After 1st and 2nd line immuno therapies, an operation and just over 11 weeks they were finally able to wake our daughter. Then followed 7 more months of recovery and rehabilitation within Queens Square. There are no words to express our gratitude to the consultants, doctors and especially the fantastic team of nurses in mitu who cared so brilliantly and tirelessly for our daughter in such a high pressure environment. You are all true professionals and a credit to the hospital and the n h s. \nOur daughter walked out of Queens Square at the end of May after an intensive recovery and rehabilitation programme. It feels like a miracle. There is still a way to go but now as an outpatient.\nA massive thankyou to everyone in mitu from the bottom of our hearts.

In the last 2 years, I have been told by CPN's that, I am under 30, I am very articulate, I am well-read. I have had a CPN tell me on the phone whilst experience symptoms of psychotic depression suggest that I go for a bath and light candles at an appointment that was supposed to be a 2nd opinion appointment but was actually the staff member again. It was also suggested to my girlfriend that I need to take responsibility and contact Samaritans and that I shouldn't be putting her through all this, like I choose to be the way I am.  \r\nI then eventually received a legitimate 2nd opinion appointment, which I didn't feel I could attend as it was via webcam and I have somewhat of an anxiety to going on camera and being recorded. I asked for alternatives and was told no. After some time I got a 2nd opinion appointment and finally got to see another psychiatrist, for them just to uphold word for word what the previous had said. Them seeming to gloss over my suicide attempt, my mania and just pinned it all on anxiety when I disagreed and asked for more than just CBT which is all I've been offered for 4 years, they didn't offer any further help, much as they have for the last 4-5 years. I have been told I am too clever to be bipolar, which really offends me, having had family members who had it who were extremely clever.  \r\nI was told over the phone when I called to speak to the on-duty CPN about my treatment by the mental health team that they couldn't do anything and couldn't change what had been said by the psychiatrists. They also said they weren't able to diagnose anything, however in the same phone call told me that it isn't bipolar disorder. I mean what is it? They can or can't diagnose it?  \r\nI was checked by the psychiatrist at my 2nd opinion appointment as I expressed that I was sick of the treatment I felt I had been receiving from them, they then ended the appointment, and refused to talk to my partner in regards to my deteriorating mental health. I was told by the health and social care partnership to phone and tell them what I need and insist on help but was told they can't do a thing.  \r\nI have been made to feel that because I may or not be intelligent, and that I can sometimes articulate myself that I am somehow not able to be bipolar or anything other than depressed and anxious, I find this to be insulting to anyone that has a diagnosis of the illness and other people that are on the spectrum. The fact this is a viewpoint I've seen perpetuated by a fair few of the professionals I have spoken to is really rather distressing. They can tell me these last few years what my diagnosis isn't, but have no clue as to what it is, I'd ask that they stop focusing on what is not and start focusing on what is then.  \r\nI have complained by other means, but I am also writing this as I hope local government and others can see this as I am truly at the end of my rope and am fighting tooth and nail to see the good in life, but this is far more distressing trying to get help than I ever thought it could be. If a patient like me with extreme anxiety, and mood swings for lack of a better term can't engage in CBT surely there are other routes? Rather than to be left languishing. my mania has subsided as I have been put on medication by my GP, the psychiatrist once said because it didn't work in my early twenties that was a sign I wasn't bipolar? Well 4 years later it seems to be helping to a degree so why are they not reversing their logic?  \r\nI write this whilst I can before I experience more of a dip in mood. I feel I have to write these thoughts before I go back under again.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-05-28T14:17:31.43","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-06-21T09:20:00.34","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Ayrshire & Arran","count":14},{"name":"North Ayrshire Health & Social Care Partnership","count":7},{"name":"NHS Education for Scotland","count":1},{"name":"Scottish Recovery Network","count":1},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2021)","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/850908","id":"850908"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/850908/responses","id":"850908"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/850908/healthservices","id":"850908"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/850908/tags","id":"850908"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/a214h","id":"A214H","score":1},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/nahscp-community-mh","id":"nahscp-community-mh","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/woodland-adult-mh","id":"woodland-adult-mh","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxious","id":"anxious"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bipolar","id":"bipolar"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/camera","id":"camera"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cbt","id":"cbt"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/depressed","id":"depressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/depression","id":"depression"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diagnose","id":"diagnose"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diagnosis","id":"diagnosis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/distressed","id":"distressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/empathy","id":"empathy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/end%20of%20life","id":"end of life"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/help","id":"help"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20good","id":"not good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/psychotic","id":"psychotic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attitude","id":"staff attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/suicide","id":"suicide"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/the%20change","id":"the change"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/understanding","id":"understanding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/spoken%20over","id":"spoken over"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/no%20hope","id":"no hope"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/alternatives%20offered","id":"alternatives offered"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/knowledge%20of%20conditions","id":"knowledge of conditions"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/862363","id":"862363"}]},{"id":855334,"author":"Flotte","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"My visit to the urology clinic","body":"One member of staff was perfectly nice as one would hope and expect.

I also noticed members of the testing staff were sitting outside the portacabins not observing social distancing, and that the risk of transmission of covid-19 has increased with approaching me! I explained that I am late for an appontment and I must go. The staff member then took my car registration number and asked me for my name. I said it was none of their business.

I felt that there was a lack of professionalism, poor communication skills and a lack of understanding.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-06-18T10:56:55.5833333","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2021-06-21T09:20:03.81","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Ayrshire & Arran","count":9}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/855718","id":"855718"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/855718/responses","id":"855718"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/855718/healthservices","id":"855718"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/855718/tags","id":"855718"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/a111h","id":"A111H","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sa9_covid_vaccination_programme","id":"SA9_Covid_Vaccination_Programme","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/annoyed","id":"annoyed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disappointed","id":"disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stressed","id":"stressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20frustrated","id":"very frustrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confidentiality","id":"confidentiality"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attitude","id":"staff attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/understanding","id":"understanding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassion","id":"compassion"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/social%20distancing","id":"social distancing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pandemic","id":"pandemic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid","id":"covid"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%20precautions","id":"covid precautions"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%2019","id":"covid 19"}]},{"id":855721,"author":"123p","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Great patient experience","body":"Just wanted to give recognition to the rheumatology department at monklands.

All of the midwives were extremely professional, caring, kind and by the time I'd had the baby felt like friends. I was seen by a couple of doctors most of which made me feel at ease and responded to my concerns in a way that made me feel reassured although I felt with a couple that I was still a bit anxious after speaking with them.  \r\nThe surgery went well - the staff involved were excellent at calming my anxiety about the procedure and the anesthetist was exceptional at managing my blood pressure levels.  \r\nI did have some adhesions which the surgeon alluded to during the procedure but I was a bit disappointed they did not come and visit afterwards to provide further detail as they normally come and go over how well the surgery went but I didn't see the surgeon again, and wanted to ask questions regarding this as I have been plagued with pain since my last section. I have struggled to gain understandable information about this since.  \r\nIn the hospital I was well cared for by all the midwife staff and felt welcome and not forced to rush home. I cannot remember everyone's name but I would like to especially thank Abbie, Suzie, Susan and Mariette for being so kind, attentive and interesting to talk with.

My last pregnancy and birth was not what I had expected, and I was not prepared for an emergency caesarean and my baby spending time in the neonatal unit. The kind caring and professional staff that have taken care of us on this journey will always have a special place in my heart and we can’t thank you enough.  \r\nTo the lovely staff in Special Care baby Unit. Nursing team, ANNP team and Paediatricians. Thank you for the outstanding care Owen received. You are an amazing team and it was so nice to see friendly faces and people I knew. Owen made a quick recovery and you helped me establish breast feeding. This enabled Owen to feed well once he was feeling better. I felt involved in my baby’s care throughout his admission and knew he was in the best hands even when I couldn’t be with him. I will always be grateful and thank you for caring for him when I couldn’t. I’m proud to be part of such a caring, compassionate and professional team. To the GP team at Coldstream Healthcentre and Doctor Morton, the physiotherapist staff Laura and Gillian and pharmacy team. Thank you for your care and continued support and advice. Midwifery team at Borders General Hospital. The continuity of care received from the Community Midwives really made a difference. Thank you so much for taking care of me and my boys. Labour ward midwives, Obstetric Doctors and theatre team. You all made me feel safe and cared for at a vulnerable time. The team in labour ward go above and beyond for the women and I feel privileged to have been looked after by you all. Ward 16 midwives and staff. The care you gave me after my caesarean was exceptional. I can’t thank you enough for your care and professionalism. The women of the Borders are so fortunate to have such great dedicated staff to look after them and their baby. Also thank you to The lovely domestic staff for always making sure my water bottle was full, thank you for your friendly chat and toast!","criticality":"not

It was not particularly pleasant, but certainly not unbearable for me. I will definitely give the biggest shout out and credit to Nicky, Heather and Ruth.  \r\nFrom the moment I arrived, I was put at ease. Nicky explained what was going to happen in great detail and the team assured me that they would stop the procedure at any time if I wanted them to.  \r\nNicky carried out the procedure in the gentlest manner, explaining every step along the way. Heather and Ruth were holding my hands throughout. I am sure that her attention to detail, correct positioning on the couch, equipment used and her 'no rush' approach made all the difference.  \r\nNothing sinister was detected as far as she could tell, but a couple of polyps need removal. I will be booked in for polypectomy. Nicky will not be doing this, but has assured me that the consultant will be equally as gentle and kind as she was.  \r\nI honestly feel hugely relieved as health anxiety can manifest and affect everything. I honestly could not function on the day of the hysteroscopy due to sickening worry. I was in tears at her kindness and reassurance.

After speaking with a midwife about my feelings and mental health struggles with people I don't know and the fear of men I was told I was able to stay in a single room with my baby to recover until I went home. I stressed that for the past 12 months my issues with domestic violence with my ex partner and having to shield because of covid being repeatedly made aware to stay away from groups of people and to stay in my home because it could have an impact on my health if I were to get covid, gave me extreme social anxiety on top of already complexed mental health issues, to the point I never left my home or had contact with people apart from immediate family.  \r\nI was moved anyway to a bay of 4 with other people and became distressed very quickly. I had no understanding from the lead midwife or other members of staff only judgement and humiliation. I felt I had to leave hospital before I was ready to in pain that I struggled to manage. Other patients were able to hear everything and made remarks to make me feel even worse. I overheard staff tell a lady in the next bed I was having a psychotic episode which was untrue as I was not in psychosis and had tutting from both of them. No one had any compassion to the distress I was in or to why. Not a single member of staff demonstrated any training on how to deal with someone who was in mental distress.  \r\nI was made to carry my own bags and baby in a heavy car seat after having a c section no one offered to help or let my sister in to help me. This is a disgusting way to treat someone especially someone in crisis. This will be taken further by myself and family if no action is taken. I believe your staff need training and compassion.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-06-04T00:50:02.3433333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-06-21T14:20:47.377","readBy":[{"name":"The Dudley Group NHS Foundation Trust","count":1},{"name":"Ulster University, MBBS (Medicine) 2021","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/851563","id":"851563"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/851563/responses","id":"851563"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/851563/healthservices","id":"851563"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/851563/tags","id":"851563"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rna01_501","id":"RNA01_501","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/crisis","id":"crisis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fear","id":"fear"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stressed","id":"stressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/accommodating","id":"accommodating"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/c%20section","id":"c section"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/domestic%20violence","id":"domestic violence"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/judgemental","id":"judgemental"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/maternity","id":"maternity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health%20awareness","id":"Mental health Awareness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/section","id":"section"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/understanding","id":"understanding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassion","id":"compassion"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/humiliated","id":"humiliated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/conflicting%20information","id":"conflicting information"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid","id":"covid"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%2019","id":"covid 19"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20home","id":"at home"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/856599","id":"856599"}]},{"id":851741,"author":"Ellie S","authorRoleId":4,"authorRole":"a relative","title":"Care of my dad","body":"A big thank you to all of the staff who looked after my dad during his recent emergency surgery.

I was met by approachable and reassuring Libby, (Nursing Support) and Judith (Senior Nurse) in EPPC. Judith was obviously very experienced in her specialty and her quiet confidence and professionalism immediately put me at ease. After Judith diagnosed me with an unexpected ectopic pregnancy, the care and compassion I received was exceptional. I had attended the appointment alone, but I certainly never felt alone or unsupported due to the care from all the staff and I’d like to mention Dr McClelland (Gynae) who formalised my diagnosis and set about efficiently taking action to manage my care and then taking time throughout her very busy day to make sure I was updated and informed about all aspects of my treatment (also giving some holistic self-care advice, thank you! )Dr Meek (Anaesthetics) who was a very reassuring, kind and empathetic presence when I very much needed it, Dr Glenn (Gynae Consultant) who’s explanations and reassurance provided me with confidence and trust in my medical care and finally to Gillian and Owen ( Gynae SHOs) for answering my questions and facilitating my discharge home quickly when the time came. To the anaesthetic nurse Jenny who kept me calm in Theatre and Katie in Recovery for keeping me pain free as I came around. The nursing care on Neely Ward was exceptional and I’d like to say a special thank you to Leah and Amy (Student Nurses), Lucy, Suzanne, Alice and Rebekah(Staff Nurses) and Meghan and Mary (Nursing Support) for all their nursing care and to all those I didn’t meet, I know you are numerous. Overall, the care I’ve received in EPPC, theatres and Neely ward under the care of the Gynae Team has been exceptional, making a difficult situation so much less stressful with their professionalism, skill and empathy. Thank you!","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-06-18T23:14:24.8766667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-06-21T15:13:27.173","readBy":[{"name":"South Eastern Health and Social Care Trust","count":9}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/855871","id":"855871"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/855871/responses","id":"855871"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/855871/healthservices","id":"855871"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/855871/tags","id":"855871"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt004_07021-epu","id":"zt004_07021-epu","score":5},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt004_07021-nw","id":"zt004_07021-nw","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anaesthetic","id":"Anaesthetic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diagnosis","id":"diagnosis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/early%20pregnancy","id":"early pregnancy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ectopic","id":"ectopic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ectopic%20pregnancy","id":"ectopic pregnancy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good","id":"good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gynae","id":"gynae"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/important","id":"important"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medicine","id":"medicine"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nursing%20care","id":"nursing care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain%20free","id":"pain free"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pregnancy","id":"pregnancy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professionalism","id":"professionalism"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/theatre%20staff","id":"theatre staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/calm","id":"calm"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassion","id":"compassion"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confidence","id":"confidence"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/empathetic","id":"empathetic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassuring","id":"reassuring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported","id":"supported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/trust","id":"Trust"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20ease","id":"at ease"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/experienced","id":"experienced"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/theatre%20team","id":"theatre team"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/856346","id":"856346"}]},{"id":855872,"author":"SolihullB","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Waiting for a scan result","body":"I’ll keep this short and sweet, unlike my situation with the NHS…  \r\nI had a virus which caused some back/upper leg pain.
