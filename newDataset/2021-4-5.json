I was advised in writing to make a GP appointment via a telephone call. I put credit on my mobile phone and commenced the call in the afternoon. Waiting through automated messages took a long time; coronavirus information is essential however, this underlines the need for a profession process.  \r\nI simply said, I had called to make an appointment but was immediately informed, there were no more appointments today, I would \"have to\" call back in the morning. I said, I could make an appointment for another day. This met with argument, and I said, even in the following month. This met with contempt: well, it will definitely be next month, certainly not yet. I said I would accept any appointment (this seemed awkward; I asked if they could get appointments on the screen? ) I had to listen while the receptionist hummed. ( I wondered privately how things would go if I hummed. )  \r\nAt last I was offered a GP call two weeks ahead and accepted. I sent details of this experience to the practice manager who said their interpretation of the recording was that I was treated calmly and politely! When I was a solicitor's PA/receptionist, I'd have been dismissed for similar behaviour. I think the team needs to shed their first line of defence mode, be impartial and reasonable.

Now am not??  \r\nComing home from hospital i changed my diet 360 to help with the IBS but the pelvic pain is still there every single day. And as well as another X-ray appointment next week for another health issue i am really at my wits end with it all , No wonder ive been put on antidepressants in the last week. i just dont understand how something like this could have been missed and put down to \"bowel problems\" when it was seamly so clear from a 2 second ultrasound that was done.  \r\nNow i dont know what scan is right or wrong or whats went on!?

I was able to do my bit for 3 days at the end. The final lone walk out of an 'abandoned' hospital at 7.45am was chilling. The whole experience has done my head in.  \r\nA deadly game is being played between District nurses and GPs who I feel play pass the parcel. Using COVID as an excuse, GPs are refusing to come out and examine people in their homes. The game continues until the sufferer reaches the 999 stage. Paramedics then take over. In our case, the GP misdiagnosed the problem over the phone - as a steroid crisis - only an abdominal examination would have revealed blood clots in the lungs coming from terminal cancer.  \r\nMum passed away 10 days after the 999 event but we had been fobbed off by GPs for the previous 3 weeks. I had a district nurse on my driveway saying they were only here to look at the pressure sores, & not here to help with the breathing problems - this is the DN distancing herself from the GPs flawed diagnosis. I feel like the ambulance paramedics and district nurses and adult safeguarding people know what is happening.  \r\nGod help anyone else in this situation. The COVID virus has been allowed to eclipse other forms of suffering and terminal conditions. Cancer, heart disease, loneliness, dementia etc. Why ?","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-04-02T18:34:43.25","progress":"Change planned","dateOfPublication":"2021-04-05T09:20:03.633","readBy":[{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2021)","count":1},{"name":"Royal Berkshire NHS Foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/836856","id":"836856"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/836856/responses","id":"836856"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/836856/healthservices","id":"836856"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/836856/tags","id":"836856"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/gps-berkshire-west","id":"gps-berkshire-west","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rhw01_430","id":"RHW01_430","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/abandoned","id":"abandoned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bereavement","id":"bereavement"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/crisis","id":"crisis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/abdominal","id":"abdominal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/alone","id":"alone"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breathing%20problems","id":"breathing problems"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cancer","id":"cancer"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diagnosis","id":"diagnosis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/end%20of%20life","id":"end of life"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/family%20support","id":"family support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gp%20care","id":"GP care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lungs","id":"lungs"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/terminal","id":"terminal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid","id":"covid"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/837323","id":"837323"}]},{"id":836863,"author":"Bergf56","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Clinically vulnerable people like myself put at risk","body":"I firstly want to thank the staff in the minor injury unit for treating me in such a professional manor. I am not one to make complaints however my experience I felt it very important to share.  \r\nI had hurt my ankle and rang for an appointment and was offered a morning appointment. As a cancer patient and other health problems, I am extremely clinical vulnerable and I was assured on the phone that the Dungannon Minor Injury Unit was appointment only and is never busy.  \r\nWhen i arrived there was a queue of people and it was overcrowded. The seats in the hallway were full and there was no social distancing.  \r\nI had to stand until I was called in.  \r\nMany of the people arriving had no masks on.  \r\nI felt very anxious and vulnerable.  \r\nOverhearing conversations it turns out most of the other people arrived without an appointment, yet were not turned away and seen anyway.  \r\nThis is completely unacceptable. Vulnerable patients such as myself have been shielding all year.

raising this poor experience for development and improvement opportunities for staff.  \r\nI attended the UTC with a relatively minor injury in comparison to a number of other patients attending that day. However, I attended to confirm my injury didn't require stitches, further treatment beyond basic first aid and to get the best possible information to treat this at home (and therefore not adding to extra unnecessary footfall to A&E). Throughout my experience, the level of communication from multiple staff members was poor:  \r\n- Was not advised of the current estimated triage/waiting time on arrival.  \r\n- Was not triaged - mentioning this as I'm unsure if my injury required triage or not and if I did, then this should be recorded.  \r\n- I felt repeatedly fobbed off when I expressed my concern at the waiting time (politely of course). For context, I fully appreciated how busy the centre was that day and knew to expect a fair wait. However, each time I requested an update for an approx waiting time after 90 minutes or so, I was told a different version of that I couldn't be waiting much longer or I was next yet watched numerous patients get called in before me. This was frustrating so I approached the desk again to ask for a realistic timescale so if I was told there would be a considerable wait e.g. another hour or two, I could have made an informed decision and sought medical advice/treatment elsewhere; rather than me sitting in UTC for 3 hours (arrived after 5pm, called in to be seen after 8pm).  \r\n- The member of staff seeing/treating me did not introduce themselves (no idea whether they were a Nurse, GP or HCA).  \r\n- Seeing me was rushed and they couldn't get me out the door quick enough which meant they failed to tell me how to appropriately treat my wound and what complications to watch out for once discharged e.g. infection signs. I had to repeatedly ask for this information which was unacceptable.  \r\nI also had to request an additional bandage from staff working the front desk for another patient, as I could see droplets of blood starting to form through a makeshift bandage. I felt this should have been noticed and provided on their arrival. This patient ended up sitting there for a considerable length of time and could have ended up dripping blood on the waiting room floor.  \r\nReporting this as I felt standards could have been better on this occasion. Just a gentle reminder for staff to not let standards slip for lower priority patients please.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-04-04T20:17:47.7766667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-04-05T10:01:03.81","readBy":[{"name":"Healthwatch Sussex","count":1},{"name":"Sussex Community NHS FoundationTrust","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/836968","id":"836968"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/836968/responses","id":"836968"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/836968/healthservices","id":"836968"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/836968/tags","id":"836968"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rdr3e-utc","id":"rdr3e-utc","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/patronised","id":"patronised"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/attention%20to%20detail","id":"attention to detail"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood","id":"blood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cleanliness","id":"cleanliness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cuts","id":"cuts"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hand","id":"hand"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/infection","id":"infection"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/infection%20control","id":"infection control"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/injury","id":"injury"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/signs","id":"signs"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stitches","id":"stitches"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/triage","id":"triage"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/uncertain","id":"uncertain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting%20time","id":"waiting time"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wound","id":"wound"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%20measures","id":"covid measures"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/869897","id":"869897"}]},{"id":836972,"author":"Greatful daughter","authorRoleId":4,"authorRole":"a relative","title":"Overwhelmed by their kindness","body":"My beloved Mum was admitted to ward 3 last month as an emergency.

A few hours later I called the ward for an update to be told she was in the ward discharge area but that they would check she was good to go and they would call me back. I ended up calling again 1.5 hours later to be told to come and collect my mother.  \r\nOn collecting my mum I realised she had indeed been waiting approx 3 hours for me to collect her but no contact had been made to organise this. I asked if there was anything else I needed to know and was told that the nurse looking after my mum had just met her and hadn’t been given a handover. I didn’t receive a discharge letter so left with the knowledge that the antibiotics were the only treatment needed. She was discharged home that night with the Hospital at Home team following up her care.  \r\nThe Hospital at home team visited my mum the following day and I was asked by the doctor if we had received the prescription of magnesium and folic acid tablets that were being taxied out. This was the first I had been told that my mum’s magnesium Levels were low. I was given a prescription which I went and collected.

They diagnosed muscular strain and Dad was happy with that. A number of weeks later, the pain had not subsided and he started to pee blood. He went back to his GP who ran a series of blood tests (that came back completely normal) checked his prostate (again, normal) and sent him for a scan of his kidneys, he got the results back the very same day.  \r\nOn the day Dr Senior told my dad that he suspected a suspicious mass in his kidney, he left my dad feeling heard, respected and above all, safe in the knowledge that he was going to do everything in his power to help. Dad said he felt like Dr Senior was his own private physician.  \r\nDad had been diagnosed a few weeks later with poorly differentiated renal carcinoma diagnosed at the Beatson in Glasgow - they suspected CDC was the cause, a very rare and highly aggressive cancer. Within a few weeks my dad had metatastatic spread in his liver, hip bone, lung and spine. The latter paralysed him from the chest down. Dr Senior called the ward he was on on a number of occasions to speak with his oncologist Dr Garcia. When we got Dad home after great efforts put in place by the whole Beatson team, Dr Senior and the East Kilbride DN’s, Dr Senior visited a number of times to ensure his palliative care was in place well. He took innumerable phone calls from my sister and I while we endeavoured to ensure my dad was comfortable.  \r\nMy parents have attended the same GP surgery in all of its incarnations since the 1970’s - I’ve never heard my Dad heap so much praise on a single GP from that practice as he did for Dr Senior. He said “he’s special, there’s not many people like him in the world, never mind doctors”. My family have been comforted by a man we hardly know at the most devastating point in our lives. Dad passed away on 30th March. He wasn’t scared, and knew that all that could have been done, had. Dr Senior removed fear from a dying man, and anger from a grieving family and we will be forever in his debt.","criticality":"not

Thank you to everyone who looked after us during our short visit, I wish I could remember your names but you made our visit go off without a hitch!","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-04-05T11:40:21.2533333","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2021-04-05T13:48:36.517","readBy":[{"name":"Surrey and Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust","count":9}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/837000","id":"837000"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/837000/responses","id":"837000"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/837000/healthservices","id":"837000"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/837000/tags","id":"837000"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rtp04_100","id":"RTP04_100","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/looked%20after","id":"looked after"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain%20relief","id":"pain relief"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/teeth","id":"teeth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/teeth%20extraction","id":"teeth extraction"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20for","id":"cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/general%20anaesthetic","id":"general anaesthetic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20ease","id":"at ease"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/offered%20refreshments","id":"offered refreshments"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/clear%20explanations","id":"clear explanations"}]},{"id":837007,"author":"woodpigeonzh87","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Two recent visits to Lincoln ULHT","body":"Visit number 1 :- Copy of letter sent to Mr Morgan CEO  \r\nI am writing in the hope that you will express my personal thanks and gratitude to those members of the dermatology team (Dr Kopcsanyi & Nurse Steph) who carried out the procedure on my right ear one day mid March 2021. I realise that I am somewhat slow in expressing my thanks but I think it’s probably an age thing!  \r\nThe whole experience was exceptionally good from the video consultation to the actual procedure. All of this was carried out with care, consideration and compassion and I believe truly defines the way that the hospital is run. Everything was explained in detail and Dr Kopcsanyi went to great lengths to ensure I fully understood all that would happen and ensured that I was quite happy with what was about to take place. The whole procedure went like clockwork and I should have expressed my thanks at that time but believe that I missed that opportunity. Please let the team know how deeply grateful I am for their care and skill and that I am so sorry I failed to express it at the time.  \r\nI believe that Lincoln UHT have gone (and are continuing to go) to great lengths to employ really caring staff and to improve services to patients. Personally I commend the use of video and telephone consultations - I found it far less stressful and time consuming and the net result was a patient who felt the whole process concentrated on the patient and not on standard procedure.  \r\nVisit number 2:- Grantham Hospital (MRI Scan)  \r\nBeginning of April 2021  \r\nAfter all the 'flack' that Lincoln ULHT have suffered over the last few years, I have to report that yet again they've more than lived up to my expectations/requirements. My visit to Grantham for an MRI scan was enhanced by the staff friendliness/helpfulness and very high standard of cleanliness! No waiting, no messing about, professionally handled and as I currently have mobility problems these were extremely well catered for by staff who actually care - from the kind gentleman 'on the door' of Tower block to the MRI staff who didn't leave me struggling at the end but took me right up to the Car Parking machine! Unbelievable in this day and age and I fail to understand as a member of the public what has gone so wrong that they need 'special measures' - I think a little more recognition for the excellent and kindly service they provide - with good cheer and a smile too! Long gone are my experiences of the 1980's when I spent time arguing with a Consultant because he was unable to understand the GP's handwriting and didn't wish to believe that I knew why I was there!!!!!!  \r\nCongratulations to a caring, kind and considerate workforce which really deserves greater appreciation.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-04-05T11:57:54.3733333","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2021-04-05T13:53:43.883","readBy":[{"name":"United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust","count":4}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/837007","id":"837007"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/837007/responses","id":"837007"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/837007/healthservices","id":"837007"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/837007/tags","id":"837007"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rwdda_330","id":"RWDDA_330","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rwdlp-xray","id":"rwdlp-xray","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cleanliness","id":"cleanliness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ear","id":"ear"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/excellent","id":"excellent"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/great","id":"great"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mobility","id":"mobility"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mri","id":"mri"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/parking","id":"parking"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scan","id":"scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wait%20times","id":"wait times"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appreciation","id":"appreciation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassion","id":"compassion"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendliness","id":"friendliness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happy","id":"happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hope","id":"Hope"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thankful","id":"Thankful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/skills","id":"skills"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/clear%20explanations","id":"clear explanations"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thanks","id":"thanks"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/video%20consultation","id":"video consultation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/excellent%20team","id":"excellent team"}]},{"id":837008,"author":"Lynne G","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Experience of A&E","body":"I visited on Friday evening and was recalled on Monday morning. &nbsp; On both occasions, all staff were lovely - couldn't have been kinder. &nbsp; On Friday, I witnessed nurses, doctors and porters dealing with a number of challenging individuals. &nbsp; They did so with patience, calmness and care, always treating these individuals with dignity.

After a week or so she was getting worse and started to develop delirium, this resulted in her being sedated and ventilated into the ICU. She remained there for around a week and half. Her condition was critical. The staff at the ICU were amazing. I had sent in some music for her on an MPS player and they ensured it was played. I emailed them photos that they printed and put around her bed. At the beginning she was too sick to speak, we were calling the ward 3 times a day and spoke to many of the staff on rotation. They were always highly professional, understanding and informative, even when we could tell they were very busy. When she was a bit better we video called her daily. They were excellent at facilitating this.  \r\nWe understand the extra pressure that COVID puts on the staff, caring for mum and also being our only information source. It must be alot of pressure describing the situation to loved ones with no medical understanding, when we are unable to visit to see us with our own eyes. The were fantastic.  \r\nUnfortunately we cant remember their names, but every nurse we spoke to was great and we would like to thank them. Mum is coming home tomorrow after a number of weeks recovering on the ward. Heartfelt thanks for all the staff for facilitating her recovery and supporting us along the way.  \r\nAfter spending almost 2 weeks in ICU on a ventilator with pancreatitis, my mother was admitted to surgical ward 11B. Her doctor was Miss Cannings and the Charge nurse was Chris. She was very ill and soon diagnosed with delirium. We called the hospital to speak to her 3 times a day and the staff were excellent at facilitating this, even though at times we could tell they were very busy.  \r\nTo treat the delirium, Chris was able to override the COVID restrictions to allow my father to visit. He visited daily and always reported positive interactions with the staff. I had recently returned from overseas where I was working and had 3 negative covid tests and fresh out of Isolation. After requesting visitation I was granted this. The daily visits were getting a bit much for dad and I knew that contact with me would help mum. I cant thank Chris and his staff enough (there was an acting charge nurse, whose name I cant remember who was a key player in this too), this decision didn't have to be taken and it helped mum massively and also us. Me and dad did alternate visits for around 2 weeks. My experience with the staff was fantastic, I met many of the nurses in charge of mum and unfortunately cannot remember all of their names. They were always on hand to help, even at times being very busy. Any questions I had were answered and they really helped me to understand mums condition and how I could help. Chris gave me some of his time when I requested so I could raise some questions I had, he was highly professional and reassuring.  \r\nThe student nurses on the ward were brilliant, they were very professional, kind, caring and mum was delighted with them. I contacted Miss Cannings with some concerns about halfway through mums stay and she gave me time too, in a clearly very busy schedule. I was highly impressed with how knowledgeable she was about mums journey, from before ICU. She was caring and kind, I had explained to her that my dad was struggling with some things and she said all the right things to reassure him on the phone. This goes the same for the active charge nurse (whos name I cannot remember). There was some concerns that dad had, more a family issues with mums sister calling the hospital, I asked her to reassure him that her calls were not a problem, which she did and the situation was calmed.  \r\nThe care mum received has be really great, also the support the family has had. In these very tricky times with COVID, I am very grateful and full of respect for all the staff. Mum is coming home tomorrow to start her recovery here. A big thank you from us and mum!","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-04-01T18:39:53.7566667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-04-06T08:10:24.707","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Forth Valley","count":8}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/836709","id":"836709"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/836709/responses","id":"836709"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/836709/healthservices","id":"836709"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/836709/tags","id":"836709"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/forth-valley-royal-general-surgery","id":"forth-valley-royal-general-surgery","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/forth-valley-royal-icu","id":"forth-valley-royal-icu","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/delirium","id":"delirium"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctor","id":"doctor"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/knowledgeable%20staff","id":"Knowledgeable Staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pancreatitis","id":"pancreatitis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professional","id":"professional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/respectful","id":"respectful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/student%20nurses","id":"student nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/visiting","id":"visiting"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassuring","id":"reassuring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported","id":"supported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/great%20care","id":"Great care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/charge%20nurse","id":"charge nurse"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thanks","id":"thanks"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ventilated","id":"ventilated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/phone%20contact","id":"phone contact"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/the%20care","id":"the care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/questions%20answered","id":"questions answered"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/the%20support%20for%20the%20family","id":"the support for the family"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/837111","id":"837111"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/837422","id":"837422"}]},{"id":837014,"author":"pyxisfc55","authorRoleId":11,"authorRole":"other","title":"Pick up/drop off","body":"I am a regular visitor at Crosshouse hospital and in the drop off/pick up carpark there is a car permanently parked in 1 of the 3 non mobility spaces leaving only 2 available.

I particularly want to mention Craig in Ward 103 who has to be one of the most considerate, devoted and calming nurses who I've ever encountered. Being in the hospital with an unknown condition can be a scary time and Craig always made me feel confident that I was in good hands. It was nice feeling assured that I'd be taken care of when I had needs. He never made me feel like a burden in spite of his obviously huge daily workload. Craig is a genuinely caring nurse who took time to talk with me and share his positivity and encouragement, which gave me some additional strength to deal with the uncertainty of my condition and the test and treatments I was receiving. He has a great big heart for the work he does and for the people he helps and it is clear that he is committed to pursuing nursing as a vocation - not merely his job.  \r\nPlease accept my deepest thanks","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-04-05T14:47:17.05","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-04-06T09:13:01.283","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Grampian","count":5},{"name":"St. Andrews University ScotGEM Medical Students","count":1},{"name":"Office of Stewart Stevenson, MSP for Banffshire and Buchan Coast","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/837016","id":"837016"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/837016/responses","id":"837016"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/837016/healthservices","id":"837016"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/837016/tags","id":"837016"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/n101h-acute-short-stay","id":"N101H-acute-short-stay","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/abdominal%20tumour","id":"abdominal tumour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/calming","id":"calming"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/considerate","id":"considerate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/encouragement","id":"encouragement"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good","id":"good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/great","id":"great"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/heart","id":"heart"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/test","id":"test"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tests","id":"tests"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confident","id":"confident"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/positivity","id":"Positivity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thanks","id":"thanks"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/837112","id":"837112"}]},{"id":837018,"author":"Bugsy Boy","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Vaccine at the SSE Arena","body":"The best performance I’ve ever seen at the Odyssey! !

They did find blood clots & confirmed an under active Thyroid, but after seeing 10 different Consultants they were going to send him home without any diagnosis of his muscle issues, which he was originally admitted for.  \r\nPhysiology refused to allow him to leave, but they could not assist him until they knew what was wrong. Now we are over six months later & still none the wiser. We have requested a genetics & genomics test but keep being informed they don’t need to do this as they can find any hereditary illnesses through blood tests. Blood test will only show what is being looked for, if you are unaware of what is medically wrong then blood tests will not help.  \r\nRheumatology suggested a steroid, which he never received, instead was prescribed a different steroid & this masked the issue with the muscle problem & Rheumatology dismissed him from their clinic. He was referred back 8 times to Rheumatology who stated it was nothing to do with them.  \r\nAfter contacting PALS Rheumatology has admitted they prescribed the steroid which did mask the issue & thought the problem was with the thyroid.  \r\nSince January he has had 3 seizures, after the second one we were advised it was a mini-stroke. We have since been advised by other departments that it was not a stroke but no answer to what happened.  \r\nToday he had his third seizure, he was taken to Derriford hospital once again.

Honestly the experience I had still haunts me to this day. I actually booked the birthing centre after the induction which made it sound like heaven on earth. I was told there will be two midwives available at all times. If needed we can be transferred to the normal ward in few minutes.This actually gave me confidence to go for the natural birth and choose the birthing centre.I waited at home for my contractions to get stronger, they were only few minutes apart so I decided to get to the hospital after calling them first and I was told to come in immediately.I got there with my husband and signed in at the reception this was around 10pm on the 30/11/2019. We were told to wait even though there was no one in-front us waiting and the waiting area was  completely empty.Anyways after half an hour when the pain got unbearable I was told to go to a room right infront of the reception area and wait there and a midwife will be there soon to check me. I literally had to wait another half hour or so and I felt as if I was going to give birth there and then. Finally she appeared and by that time I had water and blood running down my legs. She told me to lay down so she could measure how far dilated I was but I was in so much pain by then I couldn’t even sit still I managed somehow. After the check she told me to wrap a sheet around to cover and walk to the birthing room. By this time I could hardly walk and was screaming in pain. I told her she needs to shift me to the normal ward as I would like go for an epidural. I wasn’t dilated much 3/4 cm by then. This midwife completely ignored my plea left me screaming with my husband and just disappeared. After about half an hour I had more blood coming down my legs I couldn’t even stand. I was just sitting on the floor and felt like the baby was pushing down very hard. My husband looked and could see the baby’s head. He was so shocked and didn’t know what to do as he couldn’t leave me alone incase the baby just popped out. He started screaming and calling for help and the same midwife came and tried to put me on the bed which was too late I gave birth on the floor without any sheets and she caught the baby.I was treated like an animal and I feel so upset and angry every time the memories come back. I had no midwife attending to my needs since I got to the hospital I almost gave birth to my son on the floor. After this she left saying she will come back and clean the floor as there was blood everywhere and give me some pain killers but I never saw her again. My husband said she is too busy filling out the forms in my notes sitting outside obviously doing her job. Just pathetic I am scared for life and I wouldn’t wish that upon anyone. Please stay away from the maternity services of this hospital. This midwife was a disgrace to her profession!

It is getting to look  more like a faceless business than  a group of family doctors.\n\nIt is such a pity.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2021-03-31T11:23:05","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-04-06T10:37:44","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/837093","id":"837093"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/837093/responses","id":"837093"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/837093/healthservices","id":"837093"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/837093/tags","id":"837093"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/e84015","id":"E84015","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/group","id":"group"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/test","id":"test"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/861022","id":"861022"}]},{"id":837099,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"A positive experience ","body":"It took a few weeks to be assessed by a wonderful lady who left me fairly optimistic.

But feel if issues are not highlighted then improvements will never happen.\n\nMy father was an inpatient on ward 21 last weekend.  He is 78 yrs old and has never been an inpatient.  He was brought in via A&E Saturday morning and transferred to ward 21. He was frightened, alone and in your care. \n\n On arrival he said he was placed in a dirty scruffy room where the bed not made and was offered no lunch. He was was made to make do with “toast” .  Later in the afternoon I dropped off for him his overnight bag along with a sandwich and refreshments as he was hungry and thirsty.  Teatime arrived and meals delivered but there was nothing for my father.  The staff had forgotten about him.  When staff alerted by him he was offered “toast” once again! Rightly so my father declined and requested a hot meal and said he was hungry!  With great reluctance and rolling of eyes  the nurse said she would “see what she could do” .  Apparently a meal did arrive eventually which he couldn’t eat as it looked and tasted disgusting. \n\nThe following day  I telephoned the ward requesting an update on my father.  The HCA took my number and nurse looking after him never had the courtesy to call me back.  He was eventually moved to a bay following day and the HCA that helped move his belongs apparently put his fingers on the inside of the plastic water cup and his cup of tea ??? My father didn’t want to make a fuss and said nothing.\n\n I rang the ward once again the following day for an update - message was left but yet again the nurse never rang me back.  My father was finally allowed home after 4 days.  He phoned me in the morning to say he was waiting for a final Doppler test then if that was clear he could come home.  Good enough everything was clear and he was given a 90 min window for TTO’s (meds to take home). I arrived promptly after 90 mins and pharmacy had not arrived - after 45 mins waiting my father told me that he had not been given any fresh water since the day before either and I saw the empty jug and plastic cup on his bedside table.  Eventually  the pharmacist arrived with her trolley full of meds. Annoyingly  My father’s medication was missing from the order! The nurse told me that she didn’t know how long it would take and asked me to call back for it.  I requested it to be sent to Chorley but that was dismissed as she said it was in progress at RPH.  These are critical drugs that my father needed to take before 8am. Which meant I had to make the journey from Chorley to RPH by 07:30 .  \n\nAll in all I feel upset that the trust has let my father down.  When I nurse I nurse my Patients as if they are my family members.  Where were the 6 c’s and trust values ???  Yet again the discharge process failed.   Come on LTHTR - the high standards in ward 21 that once was have certainly slipped. \n\n\n","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2021-04-05T13:10:49","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-04-06T10:40:14","readBy":[{"name":"Lancashire Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust","count":2}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/837090","id":"837090"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/837090/responses","id":"837090"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/837090/healthservices","id":"837090"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/837090/tags","id":"837090"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rxn02","id":"RXN02","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frightened","id":"frightened"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20upset","id":"very upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/alone","id":"alone"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dismissed","id":"dismissed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/drugs","id":"drugs"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/eyes","id":"eyes"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/forgotten","id":"forgotten"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good","id":"good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/great","id":"great"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helped","id":"helped"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20good","id":"not good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pharmacy","id":"Pharmacy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/test","id":"test"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/uncomfortable","id":"uncomfortable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/837853","id":"837853"}]},{"id":837091,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Appointments","body":"Today I called the surgery and was told that I was 2cnd in line.
