[{"id":758423,"author":"Placida","authorRoleId":4,"authorRole":"a relative","title":"Exceptional Hospital Care","body":"My relative has received exceptional care in hospital for many years. The staff have always been very caring compassionate and competent. She felt very comfortable within the environment and was made to feel part of a family. There are too many names to mention but many stand out and reception always had a smile and a kind word.  \r\nWard B2 also provided stand out care. All members of staff, from the nurses to the domestic staff gave fantastic care and showed great compassion. Sadly this was my relative's final stay in hospital as her condition by this time was terminal, however the staff worked very quickly to allow my relative home to palliative care. We were passed over to the Haven team with medication and pain relief supervised by the community nurses. Within hours a hospital bed was set up in the living room overlooking the garden. The speed and efficiency was truly impressive, particularly during this very difficult time. Excellent nursing care continued from all staff. Sadly I have forgotten the names as this was a traumatic time. My relative passed away peacefully and pain free in her own home, which was her wish.  \r\nPowerful prescription medication was required to maintain comfort. After my relative passed I was asked to return the drugs to the dispensing pharmacy, as is normal practice. I attended the pharmacy but was informed that during the covid crisis they were no longer accepting the unused drugs. I contacted the community nurses who informed me a couple of days later that they would now accept the drugs. I again visited the pharmacy only to be informed that they would not accept unused drugs under any circumstances. I updated the community nurses to my situation.  \r\nI'm certain that this goes against policy on the handling and disposal of schedule one prescription drugs. I'm sure we will not be alone in this situation and feel there is an increased risk to vulnerable grieving individuals, it also puts young children at risk and could even provide an opportunity for illicit drug abuse.  \r\nI think that this is a highly unsatisfactory situation to which a solution must be found. We are still in possession of these drugs and need advice. I do not hold any of the excellent nursing staff responsible for this, it is clearly a management issue. I think there has been some discussion, but sadly no solution.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-04-18T14:48:17.4633333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-05-15T09:20:00.91","readBy":[{"name":"Northern Lincolnshire and Goole NHS Foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/758423","id":"758423"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/758423/responses","id":"758423"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/758423/healthservices","id":"758423"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/758423/tags","id":"758423"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rjl30_430","id":"RJL30_430","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/drugs","id":"drugs"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/efficient","id":"efficient"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/forgotten","id":"forgotten"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hospital%20staff","id":"Hospital staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/morphine","id":"morphine"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nursing%20care","id":"nursing care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/palliative","id":"palliative"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/passed%20away","id":"passed away"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pharmacy","id":"Pharmacy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reception","id":"reception"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/speed","id":"speed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/suicide","id":"suicide"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/terminal","id":"terminal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassionate","id":"compassionate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/impressive","id":"impressive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication%20advice","id":"medication advice"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/community%20nurses","id":"community nurses"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/770818","id":"770818"}]},{"id":768822,"author":"Happy Patient 27","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"E-Consultation","body":"I completed an E consultation online late one night for an ongoing yet minor issue with my ear.

(funny as the staff were frantically tapping away on their comps!)Not once did the receptionist advise it was a telephone appt, nor did she advise the appt was 3.40 even when I confirmed the time of 9.40 with her on the phone. The surgery was empty, and I was the only patient waiting for the 40 mins I waited and still wasn't able to see a doctor even though I was there with my son.\nIn these difficult times I only wish to bring my baby son for an absolute essential reason. \nVery disappointed in the service of the surgery in these past years, and I will be changing as I imagine many other long standing patients will also. \nI understand mistakes happen, however this isn't the first time.

This experience was very positve, particularly when I was feeling a bit anxious about contacting the GP surgery and the clinician I spoke to is definitely an asset to them.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-05-15T12:11:53","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-05-15T12:44:37","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/769397","id":"769397"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/769397/responses","id":"769397"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/769397/healthservices","id":"769397"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/769397/tags","id":"769397"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/g82069","id":"G82069","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxious","id":"anxious"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/775381","id":"775381"}]},{"id":769453,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"prescription ordering","body":"I called up in the morning to ask about a prescription that I needed and the service I got was fabulous my doctor was not there to approve so the duty doctor signed for it and sent to the pharmacy and within a short time the whole thing was done as usually the pharmacy takes time but the efficiency of the surgery was so good and it seems to always be the case I have only been with the surgery a year and am so happy so far so good and in my condition to me it is important it might seem so trivial to somebody else but care is important.\nThank you once again for your help\nAnna Hackett","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2019-09-12T20:51:06","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-05-15T12:55:47","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/769453","id":"769453"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/769453/responses","id":"769453"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/769453/healthservices","id":"769453"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/769453/tags","id":"769453"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l84003","id":"L84003","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good","id":"good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/important","id":"important"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pharmacy","id":"Pharmacy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happy","id":"happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/769454","id":"769454"}]},{"id":769220,"author":"NKD","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Superb treatment under exceptional circumstances","body":"I really didn‚Äôt want to go to hospital, like many other individuals I was worried that I may contract COVID 19 and I did not want to put the NHS under unnecessary strain. In addition my wife has a very rare life limiting illness called LAM which meant catching COVID 19 could be fatal. She had been shielding for the last eight weeks and I really was very frightened for her health.  \r\nHowever I had no choice when about 1030pm one Wednesday I slipped whilst putting out the recycling. I put my arm out to break my fall which it did, but in the process I injured it badly. I knew immediately that I had either broken or dislocated it. The pain was excruciating.  \r\nMy first thought was to get my wife to take me to hospital but this would potentially undo the last eight weeks shielding and in any case I could not get myself off the floor, so she called for an ambulance.  \r\nIt is fair to say that from the paramedics at the outset of my treatment to the nurses, sister, doctors, orthopaedic specialist, radiologist and the staff disinfecting and cleaning the rooms I was in, the care, compassion and treatment was second to none.  \r\nThe paramedics like all the staff I came into contact with were wearing various levels of PPE appropriate to their role. However even through the masks their concern for me penetrated the PPE and was conveyed in the tone of their voices.  \r\nBecause I had a rota cuff tear repaired 12 months ago to my now injured shoulder the A&E Doctor woke up the on call orthopaedic specialist. I had a nasty dislocation which required me to be sedated to put back in place.  \r\nBecause the staff did not want my wife to pick me up when I was ready for discharge they arranged for a taxi at the hospitals expense.  \r\nI did not get any names of the staff due to being in so much pain, I do know the Ambulance crew came from Ilfracombe to take me to North Devon District Hospital, Barnstaple and the A&E team were the night shift on Wednesday.  \r\nThey are just a few of our wonderful NHS who are sacrificing their family life as the sister who was living away from her family to protect her son who had cystic fibrosis are doing. Some are also paying the ultimate price, with the loss of their lives to treat and care for us.  \r\nI want to thank everyone who I came into contact with during my treatment. Keep safe.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-05-14T19:16:51.8933333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-05-15T13:06:03.107","readBy":[{"name":"Royal Devon University Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust","count":3},{"name":"South Western Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/769220","id":"769220"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/769220/responses","id":"769220"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/769220/healthservices","id":"769220"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/769220/tags","id":"769220"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rbz12_180","id":"RBZ12_180","score":5},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/ryf-emergency","id":"RYF-emergency","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/concern","id":"concern"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/worried","id":"worried"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/arm","id":"arm"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/caring","id":"caring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dedicated","id":"dedicated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dislocated","id":"dislocated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dislocation","id":"dislocation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fall","id":"fall"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/paramedics","id":"paramedics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/safe","id":"safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/shoulder","id":"shoulder"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/x%20ray","id":"x ray"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassion","id":"compassion"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/769680","id":"769680"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/769727","id":"769727"}]},{"id":769401,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Fabulous caring , dedicated GP i have.

The man I spoke to was quite pleasant. I was told to call anytime.\nSo I did, when I was struggling and very low. Phone call I made day one. A man answered with a sigh, I said it appears he would rather be anywhere else, he replied \" yeah of course, I'm at work\". I was flabbergasted. I felt deflated, dismissed, let down,worthless ,like I did not matter. Then he half heartedly put me on a list for a pals service. I called again the next day, this time a lady, she was Kurt, cold, dismissive, she asked me in an awful manner what was it I wanted, she then told me to be happy, I laughed nervously, she threatened to end the conversation because I laughed. I laughed because she told me to be happy... does she have any idea how awful it is to say that to someone in lockdown having just left a psychiatric unit, who is struggling everyday to hold herself together with no help from anyone. They don't know what to say beacause they tell me to meditate and practices mindfulness, I do. They suggest exercise, I do. Get a routine, I have. That's all they have. I'm trying so hard to do all this and keep myself together. When I can't I reach out, to be made to feel worthless, insignificant, difficult, inconvenient. It's heartbreaking to be made to feel like this by people in a position of trust, by people where it's there job to help vulnerable people. I just feel lost, sad, deflated, alone and worthless.

When I received a letter about my appointment it said that I should prepare to be there for up to 4 hours. Hence I prepared myself to be there until the evening. The waiting room was completely empty besides me. The doctor walked in and asked to view the moles, which he did, and then told me ‚Äòthey‚Äôre fine, you can go‚Äô. When I told him that the moles rub on my clothes and bleed, so I had been told before it would be possible to have them removed, he said that I would have to do this privately and that I should go home. Overall I spent 3 minutes in the room. I did not feel as though I was taken seriously, and although I am aware that benign moles cannot be removed on the NHS, they are harmful to me as they bleed on my clothes, and they are painful to touch. I was unhappy with the way the Doctor rushed me, and didn‚Äôt listen to my concerns, even though there was nobody else to see in the waiting room. His bedside manner was discomforting and I wouldn‚Äôt recommend taking the time to visit this dermatology department.

The 111 advised to inform my GP of an assessment they would receive following the call. So that‚Äôs what I did, I called up and informed Grove Surgery. The lady who I spoke to advised that the doctors have gone home and I should call back for a phone consultation on Monday. Bear in mind the surgery hours is till 8:30pm and it‚Äôs a Thursday. So the person I spoke to probably thought it was Friday. \n\nI‚Äôve recently signed up to Pharmacy2U for my mums repeat prescription as the local pharmacy is far. I‚Äôve ordered a repeat prescription on two occasions, on both occasions Pharmacy2U have advised that they have sent the prescription request but there is no response from the GP surgery. They therefore advised me to contact the GP to authorise my mothers repeat prescription. Unfortunately, every time I call the surgery, there is no response. On the first occasion I thought I ordered the prescription  to early, so I can understand why no one responded.\n\nMy mother is 62 years old and suffers from arthritis, high blood pressure and diabetes. She also recently returned from a minor heart attack. As I manage her medical supplies, she has two weeks of supply left of specific medication. As this pandemic is causing issues with delivery etc, I want to ensure my mum does not run out of her meds. Unfortunately, I feel as if the GP surgery does not care about its vulnerable patients.

No follow up to check. After a little while I was having dyspareunia. Long story short I was eventually referred to a gynaecologist who sent me to have an ultra sound of my womb in April 2020. Straight away the radiologist said the coil was in the wrong place. It was sitting far too low in my womb and was ineffective as contraception and likely to be cause of my dyspareuria. He suggested I get it removed/replaced asap despite corona virus effecting clinics. I had a telephone conversation with surrey sexual health services for about half an hour where she asked me all the pre appointment questions. She booked me in to buryfields for the next day and asked me to do pregnancy test in the morning as a safety measure. She explained they could only remove it due to corona (not replace it) but I would be put on a priory list when clinic returns to normal. When I arrived receptionist was very rude, I think she was on edge about corona despite the fact I was wearing mask and gloves. The telephone pre appt was to limit the amount of time I was at the clinic due to corona. I was supposed to confirm name and dob and they‚Äôd remove coil. In and out in 15 mins they said. I was still waiting 25 mins after I arrived despite being only person in waiting room. Receptionist couldn‚Äôt understand it so another doctor took my appointment. She proceeded to ask me the hundreds of questions I had already answered on phone delaying things further. I explained what happened at the ultra sound. When she examined me she said the strings hadn‚Äôt moved and I shouldn‚Äôt have it taken out. We ended up having a slight debate as I said I think the ultra sound is more accurate and I would like it out. She didn‚Äôt agree. Luckily I stood my ground and she removed it. I mentioned about the priority list to have a new one inserted once clinic had gone back to normal after corona. She looked at me as if I was stupid and said - there is no list. I asked her why the coil could have moved she patronised me again saying it hadn‚Äôt moved. Fast forward to follow up phone appointment with my gynaecologist. The first thing she said was - we need to get the coil out asap. I told her I already got it done at buryfields and she was extremely relieved. I mentioned about the strings being in place and she said it‚Äôs got nothing to do with the strings, it‚Äôs not floated off anywhere so strings are in place. The scan showed it was positioned wrong in my womb lying flat and far too low which would have definitely been causing me pain. I was so upset at how unprofessional the doctor was at buryfields. She nearly didn‚Äôt take it out despite what I told her about the scan. I honestly think you should remind doctors there that strings being in place does not mean it‚Äôs actually lying correctly in a womb. I ended up being there 45 mins putting myself and others at risk and being treated like a nuisance despite the scan showing it was an emergency.

This is such a valuable service which I understand from friends that not all practices do, so I feel incredibly lucky to have this available.\nI have received amazing support throughout  different difficulties with my heath and can not fault the care I have received in any way.\nEven during this present Covid crisis, there hasn‚Äôt been any reduction in care for their patients, just a little different.

Firstly cleanliness is poor! Even with recent virus concerns cleaning is not priority. During my admission, of over a week my bed sheets were not changed even once. The bathroom sink or toilet wasn't cleaned the whole time. All the domestic did was run a mop over the floor every few days.\n\nThe food was of fair quality but there was limited choices especially if you have to exclude certain foods for whatever reason. Meals weren't ordered or served individually rather, you were called by staff to queue up for a poor selection of meals.\n\nThe majority of staff were unaware of my medication regime and were continually forgetting my meds, delaying and making mistakes. I had to point out many times in order to receive the current medication/doses. This is very concerning as when you're in hospital you are vulnerable and expect the staff looking after you to be on the ball.\n\nStaff handovers could be improved, they regularly went over time, leaving patients waiting for care.\n\nOverall the staff were professional, however some of the nurses/midwives were rude and unfriendly in their interactions with patients. From my own experience and witnessing how they communicated with others.\n\nWith nurses and health care professionals in my family, I am all too aware of the pressures that staff face in their work. \nI commend those in the profession who make sacrifices to care for others, especially in recent times.\nIt is disappointing and worrying when you are unwell to have a poor experience in hospital. \n\nI hope the department reviews it's feedback and improves it's standards.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-05-16T18:37:47","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-05-16T18:49:29","readBy":[{"name":"Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust","count":1},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2020)","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/769491","id":"769491"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/769491/responses","id":"769491"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/769491/healthservices","id":"769491"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/769491/tags","id":"769491"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/ral01","id":"RAL01","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/face","id":"face"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/midwives","id":"midwives"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vulnerable","id":"vulnerable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hope","id":"Hope"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/no%20hope","id":"no hope"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/923776","id":"923776"}]}]
