ICT helped divert from hospital admission, preventing the development of pressure sores, and preventing infection through their vigilant observations, dignified personal care and guidance to family on how best to help and care too. \nWe have received (and collected to assist)  specialist equipment including a hospital bed, wheeled commode and moboard. We have had support in training our family to use the equipment to safely transfer mum and continue to care for her at home.\nThe team have brought such a positive approach, and an energy and enthusiasm that has really built-up mums confidence and motivation. Their skills and professionalism has guided us forwards through the challenges of the last 5wks. \n\nThe family are mindful this wonderful care has all been against a backdrop of particularly high demand on the NHS and ICT services, given the volume of patients being admitted and discharged from hospital and the crisis of recruitment to care and of course the pandemic. We appreciate how physically and emotionally demanding this specialist care work is and want to say thank you so very much for your kindness and all that you have done for us and all that you are doing to help other people in need across the county.

I'll just call and tell them that the app was closed, they tell me there's no appointments available. How? Well, they only allow you to make appointments on the day! Unbelievable! So, I'm forced to call or use the app between 7-8am or else I'm out of luck, no healthcare access! Reducing the ability to use the NHS should not be the policy of NHS care providers. \n\nSometimes I do make it through though, but I'm often not given care by the correct person. Apparently there's a number of people who are not doctors being given the issues I raise, they call them \"clinicians\", and I gather that just means those who work at the clinic. They should be honest about who is giving you care because I just assumed that it was GPs since I don't register at a GP surgery to see a nurse or pharmacist about my problems. Nonetheless, if you believe those other than a GP can fix the problem then that's fine, the monkey wrench in the system is that I don't receive proper care and the result is that I'm once again booted back to their unbelievable appointments process. \n\nEven when I've specifically asked to see a GP and offered to wait for as long as it takes I've been pawned off to one of the other types of clinicians who invariably don't give proper care, meaning they don't solve my issue, which is the whole reason I'm specifically asking for a GP in the first place. \n\nI was thinking, they need to add the option on the app to say whether or not your issue was solved, if you select \"no\" and state the reason then it would get moved up the chain to someone more qualified instead of them booting you back to the app where you don't know if you'll get an appointment in the first place. It would eventually lead to you being able to get a GP to address your concern and it would allow the people who are not GPs the opportunity to try to solve the issue along the way, so the medical center still gets to try to keep the GP workload down by using others and the patients still have access to the GP at the end of the process if they still need it because they should always have the choice of being able to see a doctor.\n\nIt's incredibly stressful to be forced to only make appointments between 7-8am, especially when you have a medical issue that has not been resolved by previous attempts, it's horrible to open the app to see the response because often you won't have the issue resolved and you have no recourse except doing it all over again and praying it makes it through to someone who can actually help you. It's insomnia inducing because you're so stressed about not missing that window to make appointments with your ongoing medical issue and sometimes you just can't sleep. Accessing your GP shouldn't be like that.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2021-11-20T11:07:14","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-11-20T17:58:35","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/897267","id":"897267"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/897267/responses","id":"897267"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/897267/healthservices","id":"897267"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/897267/tags","id":"897267"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/g85087","id":"G85087","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/concern","id":"concern"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stressed","id":"stressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/horrible","id":"horrible"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/insomnia","id":"insomnia"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fine","id":"fine"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1001568","id":"1001568"}]},{"id":897266,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Slowly getting back to normal?","body":"Just called to get my Covid booster.. quite painless and took just 2 minutes including chat about the procedure…all good.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2021-11-20T13:41:12","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2021-11-20T18:00:07","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/897266","id":"897266"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/897266/responses","id":"897266"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/897266/healthservices","id":"897266"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/897266/tags","id":"897266"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/c81002","id":"C81002","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good","id":"good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20good","id":"not good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid","id":"covid"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%2019","id":"covid 19"}]},{"id":897265,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Covid Booster Vaccine - smooth booking process","body":"I booked my Covid booster via Patient Access - online following on from a prompt text message 6 months after my second jab. \n\nThere was plenty of slots available during the Saturday clinic.\n\nI arrived to a queue of about 8 people and was seen to quickly and efficiently.\n\nI was given the vaccine on time exactly and waiting in the waiting area for 15 mins - there was not enough chairs and this was quickly resolved so that everyone was offered a seat.\n\nThe vaccine was completely painless.\n\n","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2021-11-20T14:12:08","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2021-11-20T18:01:24","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/897265","id":"897265"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/897265/responses","id":"897265"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/897265/healthservices","id":"897265"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/897265/tags","id":"897265"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/e83053","id":"E83053","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid","id":"covid"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%2019","id":"covid 19"}]},{"id":897264,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Good","body":"Went for COVID booster and flu.
