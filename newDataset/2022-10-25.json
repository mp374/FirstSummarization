parent/guardian","title":"The love and care was something to behold","body":"My son, who is five years old, is clinically vulnerable to covid19. We shielded with him in the early days of the pandemic and as soon as he turned five we booked an appointment at the Downshire for his vaccination. He has had his first two doses and last week had a booster. I just have to say something about the staff in the Downshire, and yet nothing I say will express how grateful I am to them or paint a true picture of how incredible they are. My son had been admitted to hospital previously, the trauma of having blood taken and multiple IV lines put in had left him with a fear of needles. We were the first people through the doors of the Downshire on the morning of his first vaccination, the staff, many of which have come out of retirement and who give up their weekends week on week, were ready and waiting for the children. They had toys and colouring in and even a little packet of sweets on hand. They chatted to my son, to me, and even to my son’s cuddly toy ‘Foxy’, they told us about their grandchildren, their experience of the pandemic, and why they do what they do. When they gave my son his first vaccination he was calm and relaxed. The second time we went it was on Valentine’s Day, the same staff, the same love and care, it was something to behold. After those first two doses we were able to relax a little, I let my son do some of the things that others take for granted and I was able to relax over his next two hospital admissions knowing that if he caught covid he was protected. He, along with the rest of the family, caught covid as soon as the school year began this year. We were all ok and I am just so grateful to those staff members who gave up their time to keep us safe. We returned last week for our boosters and the same staff were there and even remembered ‘Foxy’. This time, along with another sticker for Foxy, they gave my son a certificate and he is so proud of it, it is now on his bedroom door. Thank you to everyone who gets vaccinated, it’s been a terribly difficult couple of years and the only way things can improve is if people keep up with vaccination. That way families like ours and can join in with the rest of society, without being so horribly scared. Mostly though, thank you to the staff working in the Downshire, please know that you are appreciated and that we think you are just wonderful. Thank you.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-10-23T18:59:39.0233333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-10-25T09:46:08.647","readBy":[{"name":"South Eastern Health and Social Care Trust","count":3}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/989094","id":"989094"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/989094/responses","id":"989094"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/989094/healthservices","id":"989094"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/989094/tags","id":"989094"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt004-ds-vc","id":"zt004-ds-vc","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/caring","id":"caring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kind","id":"kind"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/needles","id":"needles"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/patient","id":"patient"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supportive","id":"supportive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vaccination","id":"vaccination"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/volunteers","id":"volunteers"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/warm","id":"warm"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appreciated","id":"appreciated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/calm","id":"calm"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/relaxed","id":"relaxed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wonderful","id":"wonderful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pandemic","id":"pandemic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%2019","id":"covid 19"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/selfless","id":"selfless"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/996919","id":"996919"}]},{"id":988541,"author":"Ellen22","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Ward 56 Princess Royal Glasgow.","body":"Had to have a hysterectomy recently. Theatre staff and recovery staff were caring and looked after me well immediately after the surgery. As one can imagine; having the hysterectomy done and all the emotional trauma associated with this procedure was a huge deal.  \r\nI’m a Staff Nurse myself and have been nursing for many years. Being on the receiving end of care is a totally daunting experience. Being vulnerable is scary. After receiving good care from the staff in theatre and recovery; I was transferred to ward 56 and I knew that I was in very good hands. The staff in Ward 56 were absolutely amazing. Even although I’d been through major surgery; I still had my nurse’s hat on; this made me appreciate the work and care that they were required to provide; to not just myself; but the other women in the ward even more. They were just so caring and hard working and patient.  \r\nSpecial mention must go to Meghan, Hayley, Liz, Elaine, Tricia, Angela, Diane, Mary (phlebotomist) , Caitlin, Zoya (provided care to me 1st and 2nd post op - day shift. Sorry if this name is wrong). I'm in the process of recovering at home with my husband helping. Thank you all of you girls for caring for me in what was a vulnerable time for me and also for caring for the other women in the ward.

Firstly I must commend the staff, they have all been excellent with him and very attentive to his care. We have had a positive experience during a worrying time. Unfortunately on the ward FaceTime calls (with no headphones so you can hear both sides of the conversation) hve continued well past midnight for 2/3 nights in a row and until about 930 other times. This is not helpful for sick babies. I have raised the issue with staff but I understand it’s hard for them to police also. Perhaps visuals on the ward so people of all backgrounds can understand when quiet time on the ward should be - preferably from 8/9pm.  \r\nMy husband and I have another child to look after so when we swap out we usually have her with us meaning we do a 30 second corridor swap as we didn’t think other children would be allowed on the wards. However one family had a second child with them all day from around 2-8pm who interrupted the nurses asking for juice! My child would have loved a quick hello to her brother to help her understand where he is as it is a confusing time for her but we thought best to not have her come to the ward with other sick children. We would just like rules to be the same for all the families.  \r\nI understand this is difficult and hard for staff during their busy working days.

As my wife said on leaving, 'They were awfy nice people!'.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-10-22T07:40:33.5233333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-10-25T10:23:13.743","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Ayrshire & Arran","count":8}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/988698","id":"988698"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/988698/responses","id":"988698"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/988698/healthservices","id":"988698"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/988698/tags","id":"988698"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/a111h_320","id":"A111H_320","score":5},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/a210h_320","id":"A210H_320","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxious","id":"anxious"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/apprehensive","id":"apprehensive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/continuing%20care","id":"continuing care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pacemaker","id":"pacemaker"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/respected","id":"respected"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dignity","id":"Dignity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/quick%20procedure","id":"quick procedure"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/specialists","id":"specialists"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/relieved%20now","id":"relieved now"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/excellent%20teamwork","id":"excellent teamwork"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/well%20coordinated","id":"well coordinated"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/991200","id":"991200"}]},{"id":988699,"author":"PAtk28","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"The staff explained everything thoroughly","body":"This is the second planned visit to the RHC with our child.  \r\nFrom the moment we arrived the staff were so kind, attentive and explained everything thoroughly.  \r\nFrom domestic, nurses, consultant and anaesthetist the care and approach was excellent.

The care we both received was incredible by the maternity staff, throughout the entire 5 days we were in.  \r\nAlthough my labour and delivery did not go to plan, and after 36 hours I required an emergency C-section under general anaesthetic, me, my baby and my partner felt very safe and supported.  \r\nI must mention my midwives, Rachel, student midwife Nicole and special mention to Joice who came on the nightshift and was present throughout our daughters’ birth and after. She made me feel safe in a time where I was terrified. She made sure my partner was able to receive our daughter out of theatre as soon as it was safe. And she was there when I came round from the anaesthetic, praising and reassuring me for the delivery of our sweet girl. I knew this lady for a few short hours and felt immense care from her and we can’t thank her enough for that.  \r\nI should also mention Oksanna, my anaesthetist, who tried her hardest to keep me awake under epidural/spinal for my section which again did not go to plan. She did come and visit us in labour ward post op for a quick debrief and apologised for what was out of her control. She tried and that is all we could’ve asked for.  \r\nAlso Dr Faye, we can’t thank you enough for keeping me and my daughter safe during the surgery and for acting in our best interests in an impossible situation. Although labour and delivery was far from what we imagined or wished, we left with our baby and myself both safe and healthy.  \r\nPost-natal we were well looked after in ward 16 for 3 days by Susan, Ali, Nicole, Inka and Anneka. All of which helped me establish breast feeding, encouraged me to mobilise through the post-op pain and helped with pain management and were accommodating to my partner who stayed for longer than what is probably allowed. They also answered all of our questions and gave us sound advice for caring for our newborn.  \r\nAlthough things did not go to plan, we would still say our experience was overall very positive. We received the best standard of care and left with immense gratitude to all the staff involved throughout those 5 days. Thank you will never feel like enough, but we mean it sincerely from the bottom of our hearts.  \r\n","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-10-21T19:54:56.7666667","progress":"Story

I left late in the evening and returned the following morning to what was a very distressing experience. I found my dad sitting in a chair in the middle of EAU in a gown very heavily sedated and not even able to hold his own head up and he was in fact ready to topple head first of the chair. I asked the nurse what on earth had happened and they told me they had given him medicine because he was agitated, and then turned away. I was visibly upset and in tears at how I had found my dad and the nurses around the desk all just stood and stared at me. They showed no compassion. I had phoned first thing that morning and was only told my dad had been agitated but was now asleep.  \r\nWhilst I fully appreciate sedation may have been necessary to maintain his safety I just can’t understand why he was not put back on his trolley. What has happened to maintaining patients dignity, why was he left sitting in an area where everyone was walking past? My dad is a very quiet, gentle and proud man and he would be extremely upset at being left like this. Also not one of the members of staff tried to console me and there were plenty of them around. I had to ask for my dad to be put back on his trolley which the staff then quickly did.  \r\nI appreciate A&E is extremely busy but let’s not forget the patients it took 2 minutes to return him to his trolley and that was much more dignified for him. Also let’s not forget the relatives in what is a very upsetting experience to see their loved ones poorly and in hospital.

I was diagnosed with an abnormal cervix and put on the fast track referral system. I was contacted three days later by phone with an appointment at Royal Cornwall Hospital for a colposcopy at the end of that week. The receptionist making the appointment was so friendly and was able to arrange at suitable time for me to attend.  \r\nAt the hospital I was treated with care and dignity. I am an extremely nervous patient and the nursing team and my consultant were so careful and kind, explaining exactly what was happening and taking their time to get me comfortable with the procedure. Although the actual procedure was a little uncomfortable, it was over very quickly and I was reassured that things had gone well. The team were gentle, friendly, chatty and very good humoured. They made an appointment that I was very fearful about, very relaxed and professional. I would really like to thank the team for getting me through this with kindness and dignity.

It would be great to have those options again 🙂","criticality":"minimally critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-10-22T08:56:07.5633333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-10-25T11:04:06.247","readBy":[{"name":"Midlands Partnership NHS Foundation Trust","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/988702","id":"988702"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/988702/responses","id":"988702"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/988702/healthservices","id":"988702"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/988702/tags","id":"988702"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rrex4-sexual-health-services-nss","id":"rrex4-sexual-health-services-nss","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/call%20back","id":"call back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sti","id":"sti"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/walk%20in","id":"walk in"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pleased","id":"pleased"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thorough%20assessment","id":"thorough assessment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/weekend%20service","id":"weekend service"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/telephone%20wait","id":"telephone wait"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confirmation","id":"confirmation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20good%20service","id":"very good service"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/995681","id":"995681"}]},{"id":988752,"author":"Emmgh49","authorRoleId":8,"authorRole":"a staff member posting for a patient/service user","title":"The staff have been good and the communication with them is perfect","body":"I came onto 1 south last night, after I was brought from 1 west as I had just received day surgery.

I am encouraged to take part in discussions about my health and decisions about treatment and medication.  \nTo continue to provide effective and regular services for day to day patient visits on top of a very smooth roll out of the Covid vaccination programme and the flu jab and Covid booster jab programmes, is irrefutable proof of an exceptionally well led practice and I can say with confidence that I am in very, very good hands.\n","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-10-24T15:34:57","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-10-25T11:44:47","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/989699","id":"989699"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/989699/responses","id":"989699"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/989699/healthservices","id":"989699"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/989699/tags","id":"989699"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/j81049","id":"J81049","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20cared%20for","id":"not cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20listened%20to","id":"not listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20about","id":"Cared about"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/encouraged","id":"encouraged"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/face","id":"face"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/in%20good%20hands","id":"in good hands"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20good","id":"not good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/physio","id":"physio"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/safe","id":"safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vaccination","id":"vaccination"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20for","id":"cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confidence","id":"confidence"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doing%20well","id":"doing well"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/no%20confidence","id":"no confidence"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20safe","id":"very safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid","id":"covid"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/listened%20to","id":"listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%20vaccination","id":"covid vaccination"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%2019","id":"covid 19"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/under%20pressure","id":"under pressure"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/990554","id":"990554"}]},{"id":989697,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Super efficient","body":"I was ambulanced from Windermere on Friday last 21.

However I felt I needed to leave a review to share how extremely impressed with the service I received today when I called to make an appointment on behalf of my daughter. All appointments, except emergencies, were taken. Although it wasn’t a medical emergency - the receptionist went out of her way to ensure my daughter was able to make contact with a doctor and solve the medical issue she had . It was so refreshing to deal with a cheerful person, who cares about her job and is willing to go the extra mile. If you move to the village we would highly recommend Bulkington Surgery.

A previous employee who was near the desk at the time told the receptionist how to put an action for the physio to give me a call when they would be in on a Tuesday. I think there’s a training issue here if someone who no longer works for the practice had to advise the receptionist! \n\nToday, the following Monday, I received a text message to fill in a self referral for physio. I thought this strange as I was told I would get a call on the Tuesday. I attended the surgery again. I was told the physio on a Tuesday won’t be in for a few weeks. I was given a form and told I could book an appointment online at the web address on the form. This turned out to be wholly incorrect. The form is a self referral form. There was no website to book in, as I was told. It was simply an email address to send the referral form into. So I have filled in the form and handed in at the physio post box. This is something I could have done a month ago when I asked the Gp if there was a form to fill in. This has obviously made my wait even longer than it needed to be.\n\nI had experienced problems with the Gp back in July / August when asking for a referral to adult Adhd assessment under the Nhs right to choose. I was told it’s just depression and I’d be waiting 3 years to see someone. The Gp on the phone had never met me and was very dismissive. I asked agin for the assessment under the right to choose and I asked was there a form to fill in to send to psychiatry Uk. As I had seen this on their website. I was told there was no form and would receive something through the post.  I then waited a few weeks and phoned the surgery as I heard nothing. It took several weeks for the referral to be completed. However, my request for the right to choose was totally ignored and the referral was sent over to the Adhd team at Claire House. The wait will be around 3 months longer than if I was referred under the right to choose as I had requested. \n\nLast year I was in mental health crisis and the Gp would not see me, giving me new extra medication over the telephone and with no follow up ever since. I begged for a face to face appointment at the time. I was just sent a text message to refer myself for counselling. I overall feel that the level of service at the practice has really gone downhill. feel I will be looking to change surgery. Too many barriers to book appt. Not able to phone 8am\n\n\n\n","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-10-24T17:54:59","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-10-25T12:28:31","readBy":[{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2022)","count":4}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/989755","id":"989755"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/989755/responses","id":"989755"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/989755/healthservices","id":"989755"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/989755/tags","id":"989755"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/y02274","id":"Y02274","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/crisis","id":"crisis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ignored","id":"ignored"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/adhd","id":"adhd"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/counselling","id":"counselling"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/depression","id":"depression"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/face","id":"face"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/heard","id":"heard"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/physio","id":"physio"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health%20crisis","id":"mental health crisis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid","id":"covid"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%2019","id":"covid 19"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1000193","id":"1000193"}]},{"id":988794,"author":"Matdw53","authorRoleId":8,"authorRole":"a staff member posting for a patient/service user","title":"Left very happy with the care","body":"I have been left very happy with the care that I have been getting as I have been getting treated absolutely great so far.

I was admitted a week ago for surgery which all went great. My surgeon Mr Lee was incredible through the process so kind and listened to me incredibly well, even if some other members of his team didn’t with one making me feel like they were never going to listen to me.  \r\nBut back to it so I was discharged however had to come back around a week later as I was losing a lot of blood due to blood thinners, so was given a transfusion and kept in for the night while they ran a test.  \r\nI then was informed the test tab went missing so I redid it. This came back clear so they started to discharge me then 2 hrs later before I left they realised they got the wrong test results. So when I went back my bed had been given away because of my discharge.  \r\nThey moved me to a double side room however my head was at the sink no one could watch tv and one of the ladies has a medical condition which was very upsetting as my late husband had it. I asked to move and the incredible nurses that I have moved a bed into the hall which was so nice of them I could ask for better.  \r\nThe only other problem is the food which is all bread and things like that which is very fatty I think I just don’t like it. I am still happy with the care and appreciate it.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-10-22T15:14:05.5766667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-10-25T12:46:43.243","readBy":[{"name":"Southern Health and Social Care Trust","count":6}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/988816","id":"988816"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/988816/responses","id":"988816"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/988816/healthservices","id":"988816"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/988816/tags","id":"988816"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_32024-4-south-surgical","id":"ZT003_32024-4-south-surgical","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frustrated","id":"frustrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20listened%20to","id":"not listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20loss","id":"blood loss"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/food","id":"food"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/incredible","id":"Incredible"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kind","id":"kind"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/missing%20results","id":"missing results"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgeon","id":"surgeon"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appreciated","id":"appreciated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/great%20care","id":"Great care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20thinners","id":"blood thinners"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wrong%20results","id":"wrong results"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/one%20staff%20member","id":"one staff member"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/listened%20to","id":"listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/moved%20room","id":"moved room"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/990133","id":"990133"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/992791","id":"992791"}]},{"id":989766,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Carers Support Group Meetings","body":"I have been attending for a few months, met some lovely people and got heaps of support.
