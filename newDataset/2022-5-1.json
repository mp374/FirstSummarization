I believed I needed urgent assessment so called 111. The call handler assessed me and talked to a nurse, but they only advised follow up by my GP. The nurse practitioner at the practice called a few hours later and sent me straight to Hairmyers for assessment. I believe 111 should have done this on the 1st call, as the extra hours may have been critical. I underwent several tests and was admitted for 3 days of IV antibiotics, given the severity of infection. The level of care in MAU, radiology, ward 4 and ward 8 was exceptional despite staff being very busy. The porter systems in place were fast and seamless and cleaning was being conducted thoroughly in all areas. Equipment needed was available at point of need and in good working order. The whole hospital was working in harmony. The only part which fell down is the time taken to dispense a prescription from the pharmacy. It took approx. 6 hrs. I believe I could have been discharged with this to be collected later to stop bed blocking. I hope that this feedback is useful.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-04-28T18:38:45.7466667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-05-02T09:20:01.82","readBy":[{"name":"NHS 24","count":29},{"name":"NHS Lanarkshire","count":17}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/935006","id":"935006"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/935006/responses","id":"935006"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/935006/healthservices","id":"935006"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/935006/tags","id":"935006"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l302h_100","id":"L302H_100","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l302h_110","id":"L302H_110","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l302h-acute-medical-assessment","id":"L302H-acute-medical-assessment","score":5},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l302h-radiology","id":"L302H-Radiology","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/nhs24-111","id":"NHS24-111","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/advice","id":"advice"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/antibiotics","id":"antibiotics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/assessment","id":"assessment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/call%20handler","id":"call handler"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cleaners","id":"cleaners"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/consultant","id":"consultant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/equipment","id":"equipment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/exceptional%20care","id":"Exceptional care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fever","id":"fever"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gallstones","id":"Gallstones"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/infection","id":"infection"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/iv%20antibiotics","id":"iv antibiotics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurse%20practitioner","id":"nurse practitioner"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nursing%20staff","id":"nursing staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pharmacy","id":"Pharmacy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pharmacy%20wait","id":"pharmacy wait"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/porters","id":"porters"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/radiology","id":"radiology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/safe","id":"safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tests","id":"tests"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ultrasound","id":"ultrasound"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/understanding","id":"understanding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unwell","id":"unwell"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20for","id":"cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/performance","id":"performance"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cleaning","id":"cleaning"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/radiology%20team","id":"radiology team"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/935721","id":"935721"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/937522","id":"937522"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/937652","id":"937652"}]},{"id":935194,"author":"aprilqb59","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Myself","body":"I've been trying to access mental health for eight months now.

Her final days were precious to us and again the staff ensured mum was always freshened up and looked after the family so well.

I am not complaining but feel maybe it’s something that could be considered in the future.\n\n\n","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-05-02T17:58:00","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2022-05-02T18:39:52","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/935762","id":"935762"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/935762/responses","id":"935762"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/935762/healthservices","id":"935762"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/935762/tags","id":"935762"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rjc02","id":"RJC02","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/childbirth","id":"childbirth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/colon","id":"colon"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gas%20and%20air","id":"gas and air"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/in%20pain","id":"in pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain%20relief","id":"pain relief"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/relief","id":"relief"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sedation","id":"sedation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stomach","id":"stomach"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20ease","id":"at ease"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20at%20ease","id":"put at ease"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20at%20ease","id":"not at ease"}]},{"id":935761,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"A great service no matter how long the wait ","body":"I recently had to attend A&E with my husband  on the advice of a nurse at the local g.p practice.

So, we waited.  \nJust over 2 hours later my husband had been thoroughly examined and sent home, having been referred for physio.

Amazing experience","body":"Thank you to everyone on 28th April for our elective C section to deliver our baby boy.\nFrom the midwives, anaesthetist, theatre staff, ward staff, students, we had the most amazing care throughout. I was terrified of having a planned C section (second after an emergency one at a different hospital years ago). From the moment I was on the ward prior to moment I left, the staff were amazing. In particular my theatre midwife and anaesthetist where phenomenal. They all put me at ease and talked about just about anything to keep me calm. All the staff made me laugh and and shed happy tears.\nLove the fact that even with a C section that skin to skin contact is massively encouraged from the moment your baby is delivered. Allowed us to take pictures and had music on. Couldn't have wished for better aftercare also. You can tell that the team are stretched but that had no reflection on the care me and my received. Even with other patients being demanding and impolite at times, they continue with professionalism and support.\nThank you!!","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-05-02T09:08:19","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-05-02T19:23:18","readBy":[{"name":"Bolton NHS Foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/935768","id":"935768"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/935768/responses","id":"935768"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/935768/healthservices","id":"935768"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/935768/tags","id":"935768"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rmc01","id":"RMC01","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/terrified","id":"terrified"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/aftercare","id":"aftercare"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/c%20section","id":"c section"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency","id":"emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/encouraged","id":"encouraged"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/midwives","id":"midwives"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/skin","id":"skin"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing","id":"amazing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/calm","id":"calm"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happy","id":"happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20ease","id":"at ease"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20at%20ease","id":"put at ease"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20happy","id":"not happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20happy","id":"very happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20at%20ease","id":"not at ease"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/945053","id":"945053"}]},{"id":935770,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Excellent customer Service receptionist team","body":"The Reception staff, are thorough and helpful, and direct/ navigate you in the right way with queries.
