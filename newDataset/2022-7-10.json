She then told me again to book online.  \nWhat a complete waste of my time, I still have no appointment and yet I need a medication review.  \nI had to reset my patient access password as she had sent me a new link and did not understand at all that I already had an active account.

I have given Suitably Knowledgeable to judge as my review title due to my forty years experience working within the NHS. \nOn first joining the practice while situated at Victoria Street Barnstaple and prior to its present location I had nothing but praise for each and every G.P. I came into contact with. This included the reception staff who were always pleasant and professional.\nSome years after relocating to Newport Road there was the expected change in both G.P.s and Reception staff due mainly to retirement and progression onto other opportunities.\nOn the whole the practice maintained its position as one to recommend to relatives and friends.\nSadly in my case I started to notice a change in attitudes from certain G. P.s and the odd receptionist.\nWithout exposing those by name simply because one particular G.P. remains within the practice. I was infuriated by the manner and arrogance of the G.P. in question and also one locum who has now moved on.\nArrogance and a sense of apathy along with wrong diagnosis from the G.P. and the pathetic attempt to psychoanalyse me by the former locum.\n‘Above all do no harm’ might I remind any doctor who is privileged to be in a position to help cure that this does not simply refer to the physical side of medicine but also the psychological. For me to leave the practice feeling extremely angry and above all no better off than I felt before entering the practice did nothing at all to help me with what I considered and was later proven to be health issue of concern. \nI am very happy to report that my present G.P. was paying attention during their training at medical school regarding ‘bedside  manner’\nHe / she has gone out of their way to show empathy while correctly treating my health concerns. As for the odd receptionist who was not only rude but also belligerent towards me I am happy that due to restructure of the building I no longer have to gaze upon her surly face. \nAs previously stated I would still recommend Litchdon Medical Centre .

I have complex medical needs, pancreatitis, rare genetic condition which has caused my chronic pancreatitis. Previously I have had episodes of pancreatitis which I have had to fight for my life in intensive care numerous of times.  \r\nWhen I arrived in A&E my ketones were increasing, I was becoming weaker and was beginning to feel nauseous including pain in my pancreas becoming unbearable. I waited over 2 hours before I was saw by a nurse. When I was taken, I saw by a very kind nurse who listened to all my complex health conditions and she ordered blood tests, due to my blood condition, it can mask true blood readings and I have a letter from my consultant in Glasgow who stated that all blood tests must be sent to Glasgow for them to be analysed or they can go atrial which gives a better reading.  \r\nI expressed how sore my pancreas was becoming and informed them that I had taken oramorph (as I am prescribed) earlier and it was due.  \r\nShortly after this another nurse came and stated -aww you are a nurse aren’t you, we are just going to move you to the corridor where we can keep an eye on you. I was moved to the corridor knowing that this wasn’t the case. I began to vomit bile, pain was getting worse and I was left in a corridor.  \r\nThis nurse walked past me and I asked them what was happening and why I was being left in a corridor. I informed them of my pain and that I require pain killers and my oramorph. I said I had this with me and they told me to take my own if it will help. Do you know how embarrassing that was taking my oramorph out of my bag in front of a very busy corridor full of people to dispense my own.  \r\nWhen they passed me a second time I asked again what was going on and he told me that A&E was full of “sicker” people and I would be waiting hours to see a doctor as they need a bed as they are “much sicker”. I have never felt so worthless in my life!  \r\nAfter what felt like an eternity I was saw by a medical doctor who was extremely patronising, stating the hospital was at full capacity, my blood levels are ok, I should go home as there's no beds.  \r\nHowever, I told them that I normally see the surgical team as there's more to this and my pain is not manageable at home. I feel so embarrassed as I was crying in a corridor, full of paramedics and patients as your doctor and nurse made me feel like all I was after was pain killers, they weren’t listening to me. However, I did finally see 2 surgeons who listened and properly examined me and admitted me to ward 4.  \r\nI was in hospital for 6 days, in this time I was in DKA, I required a CT scan due to pancreas pain, they struggled to get my sugar levels stabilised, I was put on strong pain relief, IV Fluids, anti-sickness and I was put on a sliding scale to help with the DKA.  \r\nThankfully someone did listen or I would have gone into DKA at home without medical support. I am absolutely disgusted at how I was treat. For your staff to constantly say -you’re a nurse you know how it is. Well actually, yes I am a nurse but on Thursday I was a patient who required and needed treatment to be treat so disgusting as my presentation wasn’t “as sick” as they would like!","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-07-07T16:16:34.5233333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-07-11T09:20:02.587","readBy":[{"name":"NHS
