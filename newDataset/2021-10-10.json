It is extremely appalling. People left sitting in wheelchairs for hours without an ounce of consideration for their dignity. One elderly lady had to ask another patient in the waiting area for support to use the toilet before your  staff intervened. \n\nThe waiting list is poorly managed. ill people were walking out after hours of not being attended to. The attitudes of staff was appalling.The name badges are so small I couldn’t see their name. A staff member became rude when people where beginning to be frustrated by your waiting times, she began to portray herself as a victim of the frustrations people were expressing. She has no etiquette unfortunately. She kept pronouncing people’s names incorrectly especially difficult African surnames. I requested that she pronounced my name correctly and she was irritable in her response not even taking a moment to reflect that it is not ok not to pronounce people’s names in that fashion.\n\nIt was sad to see people walking out with their children without being seen. How has it come to this?  CQC needs to station it’s self in your urgent Care Centre to see what is happening. I understand there is a nurse and doctor shortage. If you are unable to operate safely consider closing down rather than give people hope that care is available. From my assessment today there is no care. The safety of urgent care attenders is at risk. I call out to CQC to carry out a review of this centre urgently.\n\nThe doctors and nurses are amazing when you do get to see them I must say.\n\n","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2021-10-08T19:18:50","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-10-10T09:40:19","readBy":[{"name":"King's College Hospital NHS

Not sure if this is the same in all surgery's but it's been like this well before the Pandemic at this practice.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2021-10-09T09:43:09","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2021-10-10T17:13:44","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/885111","id":"885111"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/885111/responses","id":"885111"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/885111/healthservices","id":"885111"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/885111/tags","id":"885111"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/n81020","id":"N81020","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frustrating","id":"frustrating"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fantastic","id":"fantastic"}]},{"id":885104,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Nothing is done","body":"","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2021-10-09T09:44:24","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-10-10T17:15:04","readBy":[{"name":"Staffordshire and Stoke on Trent Partnership NHS Trust","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/885104","id":"885104"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/885104/responses","id":"885104"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/885104/healthservices","id":"885104"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/885104/tags","id":"885104"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/r1e56","id":"R1E56","score":null},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/916957","id":"916957"}]},{"id":885110,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Flu jab","body":"Excellent service quick and simple 1024 appointment yet jabbed at 10:21 home with a coffee by 10:30.

He arrived at the care home at 3.15pm, five minutes before discharge - quite a feat. The care home (we found out where he was at 6.30pm) indicated that this is typical of Whiston Hospital. We have been unable to see my father for 5 weeks, the staff have refused to let us speak to him, telling that he was asleep no matter what the time of day. Now they discharge him without telling us as if he is a piece of rubbish to be got rid of. Pals have been contacted in 2 separate occasions and failed to contact us in return - complete and utter failure. \nWhiston Hospital is fine as long as you don’t challenge them in any way, once you do they are completely cruel towards the person in hospital. How they call themselves members of a caring profession is beyond me - they have been anything but caring in the way that they have treated a very vulnerable old man.

Forever grateful……","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2021-10-09T06:27:04","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-10-10T21:13:44","readBy":[{"name":"Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust ","count":1},{"name":"Healthwatch Sheffield","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/885143","id":"885143"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/885143/responses","id":"885143"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/885143/healthservices","id":"885143"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/885143/tags","id":"885143"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rhqhh","id":"RHQHH","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breast","id":"breast"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breast%20cancer","id":"breast cancer"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cancer","id":"cancer"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diagnosis","id":"diagnosis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/887754","id":"887754"}]},{"id":885142,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Hysteroscopy… a positive experience ","body":"After referral by my GP following slight post-menopausal bleeding, I was seen within 2 weeks at my nearest clinic at Dewsbury Hospital, where I had a trans- vaginal ultrasound and pelvic examination. Both were painless, staff were caring and responsive to my needs. I was advised an outpatients Hysteroscopy was recommended as I had a slightly thickened endometrial lining. Leaving with an explanatory leaflet, explaining a fairly simple, mostly painless procedure \n(albeit there was a warning that some women could find it extremely painful), I took to the internet for further investigation … and really wish I hadn’t! Whilst there were some encouraging reports, there were quite a large number of reviews across various social media/medical platforms stating that the procedure was brutal and worse than childbirth! And I believe for some it is.\nWithin the next 3 weeks, I had my appointment,this time at Pinderfields. I have to say that I was very nervous about the level of potential pain/discomfort I could bear as a post menopausal, 57 year old who has never given birth! I really shouldn’t have worried SO much. All the staff in outpatient department 8B were excellent. The lovely doctor performing the procedure told me what was going to happen and she listened to my concerns about not having a local anaesthetic. She advised that she would know straight away by how my cervix reacted, and if she thought there would be difficulties/it was too painful, she would administer a LA. In the treatment room also were two nurses.. one to stay and chat by my side and another to assist the doctor. They were all lovely, chatty and very reassuring. I can’t say that the procedure wasn’t uncomfortable at times, because it was. The initial use of the speculum was uncomfortable, but that’s probably my individual situation. I think the ungainly, awkward presence of the instruments and the anticipation of bad pain, which didn’t really materialise, was the worst part of the process.  I felt some light cramping period type pains pushing through my cervix and once the hysteroscope was in my uterus, and slight nipping pains when the small polyps that were discovered were removed. My procedure took about 25 minutes altogether and I was given a lovely relaxing cup of tea and biscuit afterwards.  \nI thought it important to write this review to show that as individuals each of our experiences can be different. It was explained that the procedure can stop at any point if it became too painful.  Choice is the keyword. Don’t be pressured into anything you’re not happy with. \nThanks again to the fabulous NHS staff who cared for me so well that morning.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2021-10-09T20:09:50","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-10-10T21:13:49","readBy":[{"name":"Mid Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/885142","id":"885142"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/885142/responses","id":"885142"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/885142/healthservices","id":"885142"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/885142/tags","id":"885142"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rxf05","id":"RXF05","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nervous","id":"nervous"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20cared%20for","id":"not cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20listened%20to","id":"not listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/worried","id":"worried"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anaesthetic","id":"Anaesthetic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/awkward","id":"awkward"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/birth","id":"birth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bleeding","id":"bleeding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20about","id":"Cared about"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cervix","id":"cervix"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/childbirth","id":"childbirth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/excellent","id":"excellent"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hysteroscopy","id":"hysteroscopy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/important","id":"important"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/menopausal","id":"menopausal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pelvic","id":"pelvic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/polyps","id":"polyps"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pressured","id":"pressured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ultrasound","id":"ultrasound"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/uncomfortable","id":"uncomfortable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/uterus","id":"uterus"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vaginal","id":"vaginal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/well%20cared%20for","id":"well cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20for","id":"cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happy","id":"happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thanks","id":"thanks"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/worse%20than%20before","id":"worse than before"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20worried","id":"not worried"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20happy","id":"not happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20happy","id":"very happy"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/885626","id":"885626"}]},{"id":885146,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Helpful and Friendly surgery ","body":"I have been with this surgery for over 23 years, I’ve always had excellent care from everyone at this surgery.

Door mats outside the ramp leading up to the main door threshold. \n\nThey have \"sealed\" a window with standard household expanding foam.\nThere are defective bricks on the front/ side visible by the public and defective render/apalling repairs etc\nImprovements needed have been mentioned on 2012 cqc reports and every other report produced since 2009 to be factual.\n\nThe same reasons given every time are along the same lines of being in the process of carrying out improvements or repairs.\n\nThis so far, from the exterior do not appear to meet building Regs or the VFM standards etc.\n\nThere is even vegetation growing out the cracked and defective brickwork at the front.\n\nGoodness knows whether there is damp inside affecting health and wellbeing of anyone setting foot in the actual building.\n\nThere looks to be a high staff turnover and poor reviews on employment websites regarding how the managers operate. I cannot comment on this as I can only go off the trends in all these reviews left by former employees etc but it is relevant in that it confirms the points in all the CQC inspection reports regarding the lack of management for documentation to manage and prevent risks. \n\nLooking at how quickly the clatterbridge Liverpool hospital was built from scratch, how has this care home got away with shoddy repairs clearly not undertaken by professionals (under the Hackett review this is not good practice) and how have they not completed the improvements they were told to make year in year out on the back of the CQC reports since 2009?\nThis is very concerning to think they actually provide care services for human beings but appear to have a total disregard to safety and protection from risks of their service users,  staff, visitors by not taking these risks seriously.\n\nI hope no one else gets hurt here which is why I felt the need to say something as I couldn't live with myself not doing so, based on all the research I have done on this care home. It really has got to me and I'm so glad I found this place as I definitely won't be sending my relative here.

Her experiences with \"home care\", and a trial period in a more modern (no doubt efficient) care home in the area, had been depressing as the personnel in both situations had not made meaningful personal contact with her, to the point of apparent rudeness. It was therefore a relief to find that after a few weeks' settling in at Enbridge House, my aunt had formed an excellent relationship with the owner and staff, and frequently told us that she was happy to be there. In her late 90s and when she passed her 100th birthday, she became increasingly unable to hear conversations or to concentrate on them, so the family atmosphere of the home, the cheerfully attentive attitude of the carers, and their knack of bypassing hurdles to communication with their clients, made her day-to-day existence bearable despite her various long-term health issues. I am aware of the CQC report in August 2021 which found various aspects of the home inadequate: all I can is that the report writer did not experience the high quality of care which I, my sister, and my aunt's other visitors frequently remarked upon. Enbridge House has a good reputation in nearby Newbury, and I wonder how many (if any) residents, or relatives of residents, were asked for their views and experiences before that report was finalised. The only criticism I would make of the home is that it could do with some refurbishment particularly to the frontage and exterior, which would probably be the first thing to happen should a marketing guru be appointed. But what really matters in a care home, which I shall remember when it's my turn to go into one, is friendliness of the staff towards residents and the homely atmosphere which that leads to. Enbridge House was first-rate in that regard.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2021-10-10T09:20:17","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2021-10-10T21:30:58","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/885166","id":"885166"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/885166/responses","id":"885166"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/885166/healthservices","id":"885166"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/885166/tags","id":"885166"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/1-119432968","id":"1-119432968","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/excellent","id":"excellent"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good","id":"good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20good","id":"not good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happy","id":"happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20happy","id":"not happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20happy","id":"very happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20home","id":"at home"}]},{"id":885161,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Great organisation","body":"Had my flu jab, really well organised, easy to book and in and out in under 10 minutes.
