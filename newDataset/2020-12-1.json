I was in a coma for 3 – 4 weeks.  \r\nI was moved to the City Hospital. When I woke up, just lying in bed with tubes all over me I can remember being thirsty and the nurse moistening my lips with a sponge.  \r\nMy treatment was second to none. Every nurse, doctor and physio were so good. There wasn’t enough staff, but the staff that were there were absolutely brilliant. They talk to you as a person – and that makes all the difference.  \r\nI came to Ward 2 in the Whiteabbey Nightingale. I had six days of good, solid rehabilitation. Once I got in, everyone was round making sure I was comfortable. Olwyn and Gill got me on my feet in five days without aids.  \r\nThe staff always help me with my needs. Ruby is so friendly. Karen is another angel… and Tracy, Hayley and Marion. In fact all the staff are the same.  \r\nThe ward is comfortable. It is spotless. The domestics and nurses are always wiping everything down. The food is good. Cups of tea – the nurses always get me one.  \r\nEverything is always done with a smile.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-12-01T09:17:45.7466667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-12-01T09:24:54.563","readBy":[{"name":"Belfast Health and Social Care Trust","count":13},{"name":"Northern Health and Social Care Trust","count":9},{"name":"Public Health Agency","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/807294","id":"807294"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/807294/responses","id":"807294"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/807294/healthservices","id":"807294"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/807294/tags","id":"807294"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt001_02020","id":"ZT001_02020","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt001_12036","id":"ZT001_12036","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt002-nightingale2","id":"ZT002-nightingale2","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/aids","id":"AIDS"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cleanliness","id":"cleanliness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/feet","id":"feet"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/food","id":"food"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/more%20staff","id":"more staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/physio","id":"physio"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/rehabilitation","id":"rehabilitation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tubes","id":"tubes"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid","id":"covid"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/808258","id":"808258"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/808654","id":"808654"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/809763","id":"809763"}]},{"id":807301,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Prompt and very efficient","body":"In combination with NHS111 and William Harvey Ophthalmology Dept the Faversham Urgent Treatment Paramedic was able to deal with my queries in a prompt and efficient way.

It is extremely difficult to get through at 8am to book an appointment, so most if not all are gone when you finally do get through. (For flu jabs, people seem happy, but maybe it is scheduled or walk in). Also, there is no 'place in queue' system, so you have no idea if they are about to answer, which on average seems to take about 20 minutes. In theory, there is an online booking system with the website saying you can book up to four months in advance. I've been on several times at different periods, but this has never been the case; there are often no GP appointments on it at all - today just had phlebotomy (?) appointments. Again this is compounded by no information on how many appointments are available, if they are added every day, or once a week etc, or when they go live so you can book. This means you have to sit on your computer throughout the day refreshing the screen to see if anything comes up.  So after failing the telephone and online route, you can try a different NHS symptom call back service. This means registering on their website, but today's slots were also taken, but again, no information on how many are available. That system goes live at midnight every day, so I am going to stay up and try that. At the end of the day, the phone and two online systems are routing you to a fixed number of doctors, and there are obviously not enough. But then it is a waste of time finding this out, and obviously aggravates staff and patients as other reviews demonstrate. A couple of things could help this fruitless waiting - one, put a 'place in queue' on the phone system; two, add text (or blocked out calendar) to the online appointments system or on the main website, saying how many online bookings are usually available and when they go live; three, add text (or blocked out calendar)  on the NHS symptom call back service. The advice pre Covid was to actually turn up at the surgery round 7.30am to get an appointment, which is what I have done before, but this is obviously not available, plus it is bit of an indictment. Finally, if you go to the walk-in clinic downstairs in desperation (also done this) it is usually a long wait, but more importantly, if your problem needs a hospital referral, they can't do this, so you have to go back to trying to see your GP. Be warned! All that said, if and when you do get an appointment, the staff are always lovely, but I don't think they fully realise how awful the booking system is, either because they don't go through it, or because patients are so grateful to see them that they don't say anything, or because they dismiss the complaints here as  unbalanced. I do hope it gets sorted as it is miserable. I meanwhile, will try at midnight, and/or at 8am!","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-11-30T21:36:22","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-12-01T09:44:30","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/807305","id":"807305"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/807305/responses","id":"807305"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/807305/healthservices","id":"807305"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/807305/tags","id":"807305"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/g81658","id":"G81658","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/periods","id":"periods"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happy","id":"happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hope","id":"Hope"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/no%20hope","id":"no hope"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20happy","id":"not happy"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/865919","id":"865919"}]},{"id":807316,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Ticking all the right boxes","body":"The staff This practice have been amazing the receptionists are really polite and helpful nothing is too much trouble.

I feel like I need to provide this feedback even though I'm sure it won't make a difference. I was told by a midwife that I needed an Anti D injection as soon as possible due to potential internal bleeding. The Midwife then booked me in for an appointment at 7pm at the Willow Ward at Musgrove Hospital for a blood sample and an Anti D injection. When I arrived at the Willow Ward the waiting room was empty but for some reason they still made me wait 30 minutes before taking a blood sample. All the while there were a few care assistants chatting nearby. I asked the person doing the blood sample if they knew what it was for and was told no and that they had been told to take a sample and that was it. I knew that the sample was to confirm if there had been internal bleeding. After the blood sample I was told to go wait in the empty waiting room again. The staff member doing the blood test then comes up to me later with the label for my blood test asking me to check that my name was spelt correctly, which it wasn't, even though they had my papers. I was then left waiting in the lobby for a further 3 hours, waiting for an Anti D injection. The care assistants were too busy chatting amongst themselves the whole time. I had to repeatedly go up to them to try to find out what was going on and why I was waiting so long. They were not able to provide me with any answers and it seemed like they didn't know anything. They just kept saying that they will ask someone. In total I had been left waiting in the empty lobby by myself for 3. 5 hours. My husband wasn't allowed in even though it was only me there and the waiting room could hold 4 people with social distancing. The care assistants did not even offer me a glass of water or anything. They just ignored me for 3. 5 hours until I finally broke down crying from the whole situation and from pain from sitting in the same seat for so long. At that point they saw me crying and went and got a midwife who gave me the Anti D injection. I asked the Midwife why it took so long and they said that they didn't realise I was waiting for so long. This is hard to believe because I had a booking for 7pm and it was now 10:30pm. I was the only person in the waiting room so everyone saw me sitting there and kept looking at me as they walked past. I asked when I would know the results of the blood test and the midwife said they may have them tomorrow. So there was no explanation why it took 3.5 hours for an Anti D injection.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-11-28T08:47:32.2866667","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2020-12-01T10:55:03.05","readBy":[{"name":"Somerset NHS Foundation Trust","count":6}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/806902","id":"806902"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/806902/responses","id":"806902"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/806902/healthservices","id":"806902"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/806902/tags","id":"806902"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rh5a8-501","id":"RH5A8-501","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disgusted","id":"disgusted"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ignored","id":"ignored"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lack%20of%20care","id":"Lack of care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20test","id":"blood test"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/injection","id":"injection"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/maternity","id":"maternity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting","id":"waiting"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/access%20to%20refreshments","id":"access to refreshments"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/explanations","id":"explanations"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care%20assistants","id":"care assistants"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/inattentive","id":"inattentive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/service","id":"service"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helpful%20answers","id":"helpful answers"}]},{"id":806956,"author":"Womb64","authorRoleId":1,"authorRole":"a carer","title":"Poor Care of a vulnerable disabled patient with dementia","body":"My husband is reliant on people for all his care due to his disability & vascular dementia. He was declared medically fit 10 days before he actually came home. They wouldn't let him come home because he wouldn't eat for them so I said he will at home but no they wouldn't let him out. Then they said his sugar levels weren't stable. Well no they wont be because he's in hospital & wont eat properly. When he finally came home they'd put him on different insulin the day before & his blood sugar rose to 29 with ketones of 3.4 so had to phone 111 who sent paramedics who wanted to take him back to RH but he refused. He was so dehydrated he didn't pass urine properly for over 48 hours, he'd lost 2cm from the circumference of his arm. He had dirty dressings on. Dried hard food that had to be cut out of his beard. He couldn't drink as he had no strength to suck on straw I had to use a syringe. His mouth was full of brown gunk & he couldn't communicate as he was so dry & had to blink for yes & no for me.Apparently they'd informed me of his deterioration. I'd love to know when they phoned me as I can prove from phone records that they didn't.  \r\nIn my opinion they nearly let my husband die. They said he refused personal care so why didn't they let him come home so I could look after him. A few days after being at home he is communicating well, eating & drinking, already putting weight on & his diabetes is stable again as he's back on his original insulin.  \r\nI'm disgusted that people who are supposed to care, people you trust your vulnerable loved ones with, can stand by & let someone deteriorate like that when all they needed to do in my view was let him come home & be looked after properly because there was nothing medically wrong to stop this happening.","criticality":"strongly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-11-28T21:18:27.19","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-12-01T10:58:51.273","readBy":[{"name":"The Dudley Group NHS Foundation Trust","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/806956","id":"806956"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/806956/responses","id":"806956"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/806956/healthservices","id":"806956"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/806956/tags","id":"806956"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rna01_430","id":"RNA01_430","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/angry","id":"angry"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disgusted","id":"disgusted"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/basic%20care","id":"basic care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20sugar","id":"blood sugar"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dehydrated","id":"dehydrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dementia","id":"dementia"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diabetes","id":"diabetes"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disability","id":"disability"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dressings","id":"dressings"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/drinking","id":"drinking"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/insulin","id":"insulin"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ketones","id":"ketones"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/neglect","id":"neglect"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vascular%20dementia","id":"vascular dementia"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/weight","id":"weight"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/824990","id":"824990"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/825047","id":"825047"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/825104","id":"825104"}]},{"id":806946,"author":"kg-2020","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Made my recovery much easier","body":"I had the misfortune recently of undergoing a fairly upsetting operation.

We really felt such support by her attentiveness.  \r\nWhen it came to the birth, I was completely in the zone of breathing through each contraction, so although I did not interact much with Diane and our second midwife, Kylie, I knew they were there the whole time and that I didn’t need to worry. I was confident that they would follow our birth preferences that we had discussed during our antenatal appointments and Diane was brilliant at understanding our desires and following these through at every point. I was very grateful when she reminded me that I wanted to catch our baby, as I would have forgotten in the moment! The little touches such as Diane’s knowledge and use of aromatherapy were so thoughtful and appreciated. During labour, although my eyes were closed in concentration, I knew that either my husband or Diane or Kylie were there beside me to hold my hand, give me water or snacks, help with the gas and air or simply mutter a word of encouragement.  \r\nThe birth was so calm and couldn’t have gone better. I really am so grateful to Diane for her attention to detail and kindness throughout our antenatal experience and then during the birth. I didn’t need to worry at any point that our choices would not be supported, which gave me the freedom to focus completely on remaining calm and concentrating on birthing our baby. It was Kylie’s first home birth which was such an honour and she was also so supportive in her role.  \r\nThank you both so much for supporting and sharing the experience with us. I would highly recommend the Home Birth team! I felt so well cared for by Diane and her attentiveness was very much appreciated.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-11-29T01:44:27.17","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-12-01T12:01:36.2","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Ayrshire & Arran","count":6},{"name":"Scottish Government","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/806960","id":"806960"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/806960/responses","id":"806960"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/806960/healthservices","id":"806960"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/806960/tags","id":"806960"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/a111h_501","id":"A111H_501","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sa9-community-maternity","id":"SA9-community-maternity","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/antenatal","id":"antenatal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/aromatherapy","id":"aromatherapy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/birth","id":"birth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/birth%20plan","id":"birth plan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breathing","id":"breathing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/brilliant","id":"brilliant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20about","id":"Cared about"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kindness","id":"kindness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/labour","id":"labour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/midwives","id":"midwives"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pregnancy","id":"pregnancy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professionalism","id":"professionalism"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supportive","id":"supportive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/understanding","id":"understanding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/well%20cared%20for","id":"well cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/calm","id":"calm"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confidence","id":"confidence"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported","id":"supported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wonderful","id":"wonderful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/attentiveness","id":"attentiveness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pandemic","id":"pandemic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/choices","id":"choices"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/807396","id":"807396"}]},{"id":806978,"author":"doneman","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Delay to normal services","body":"I am speaking on behalf of my wife who is suffering badly from rectal bleeding and pain since July 2020.

They were lovely and friendly but left me to it and kept my curtain around me shut. Weirdly there wasn't another person in the ward, made it even weirder. The midwife who was there at night wasn't the nicest, and made some remarks that I'll never forget. Waters broke through the night, once there was a staff change (not sure of timings) things honestly couldn't have been better the staff, midwives, doctors and a student were all absolutely fantastic. Made me feel so as ease and comfortable. We were moved to the ward later that day and said a sad goodbye to my husband. Again the staff in the ward downstairs were amazing! They helped me so much, I was finding it hard to stand and was bed bound for a while to recover. And they were brilliant. Anytime I buzzed they were straight in. Very helpful. They were fantastic with our son too. Helped me feed him and bathe him etc. Also the food was lovely too.

I was in a very vulnerable state and quite poorly with a number of lifelong mental and physical health conditions, and suffering the effects of overprescription of drugs by numerous different Drs and specialists who did not communicate amongst themselves.\nI attended an appointment with a GP at Ashfields who took the time to listen to the whole of my story, list of medications and past difficult experiences in healthcare. He worked with me in partnership to prioritise my needs, make appropriate referrals, alterations to medications and used the extensive social prescribing services locally.\nIt was wonderful to be able to see specialists on site with very short waiting times in comparison to my previous surgery. The Dr also suggested a variety of reading and learning that I could undertake to support my recovery, including psycho education at the Involvement Recovery and Wellness Centre at Cheshire and Wirral Partnership Mental Health Trust. \n18 months on my health has improved significantly, I am no longer taking innumerable medications, have had my diagnoses reviewed and adjusted, have taken part in local get active and weight management programmes and have lost over 4st in weight. I feel much more confident in myself and my ability to manage my health and have started volunteering. This turnaround was unthinkable to me before coming to the practice.\nMy only criticism would be that the local pharmacy provision is under resourced and the administration of prescriptions can sometimes be inefficient, especially with complex poly-pharmacy across an array of medical specialisms. I think that this is not solely an internal problem, as manufacturing delays have been caused by Brexit and Covid and there are a limited number of pharmacies locally which have their own administrative inefficiencies that add to errors and delays.\nDespite this single issue, everyone at the practice from Receptionists, Phlebotomists, Nurses, Drs and Allied Health Professionals have been welcoming and friendly. They have worked together to help me improve my health and wellbeing. They are person centred in approach, treating patients as human beings not medical conditions to be fixed. I would not hesitate to recommend this practice to anyone new to the area. In particular they have been excellent in their approach to mental health.\nThank you Ashfields for giving me the tools to live a full and productive life.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-12-01T13:07:52","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-12-01T13:47:40","readBy":[{"name":"Sheffield University Medical School 2020","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/807386","id":"807386"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/807386/responses","id":"807386"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/807386/healthservices","id":"807386"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/807386/tags","id":"807386"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/n81032","id":"N81032","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/inefficient","id":"inefficient"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diagnoses","id":"Diagnoses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/drugs","id":"drugs"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pharmacy","id":"Pharmacy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vulnerable","id":"vulnerable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/weight","id":"weight"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/weight%20management","id":"weight management"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confident","id":"confident"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wellbeing","id":"wellbeing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wonderful","id":"wonderful"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/807967","id":"807967"}]},{"id":807385,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"badly managed practice","body":" I have been registered in this practice in 2015, since I was with them they have never provided me with the right help or the right information.\nThe secretaries are incompetent and unhelpful, they show no care. I went to see them for eye chemical injury they give me a list of local opticians and told me to arrange my own appointment with them. There was no appointment available in the next 3 days and I couldn't wait that long but they said they couldn’t do anything and that I needed to wait. I asked if there is any other emergency eye service I can go to and they said there is none, instead of sending me to the emergency eye clinic in Stepping Hill hospital.\nThe management and the communication are deplorable. For someone like me who has chronic health problems and needs regular follow ups and consistency from the doctors and health staff, this is definitely not the best health service you can have.\n\nThey always give me an appointment with a different GP so I have different diagnosis for the same problem because the GP doesn't bother to look at the system to see your previous medical history which makes it inefficient. I spend a year going for the same problem before they refer me to the specialist and even then the referral didn't include all the relevant information.\n\nSome GPs  they don’t care to let you set for the consultation.\nThey don’t spend more than 2 minutes with you.\n\nOne time the GP told me that he needed to end a consultation because she is late.

The receptionists are an abolute joke! They give different informarion each time and when you question them about this they take the easy way out and hang up on you! Knowing it is very unlikely we're going to wait 40 mins in a queue again to speak to someone! This has happened about 10 times now! Ive never come accross such poor service! They dont know how to communicate at all, no politeness or respect, each time i come off the phone i feel either very upset or frustrated. Theyre an absolute nightmare surgery to deal with that give conflicting information each time! This definitly needs to be addressed as its clear the receptionists are lacking knowledge of basic procedures and services the surgery offers and they need to be trained on how to actually speak to people with respect instead of hanging up and being completely rude! Its just always feels like a battle ringing through to the surgery to get anything sorted. This is just the receptionists, im not even going to comment on the GPs and their incompetence and lack of care and urgency!

Consequently I rely a lot on written communications.  But it seems this practice can't do that, preferring to ask patients to phone or jump through hoops with the online GP 'app'.  I imagine it's easier to get an audience with the Queen herself!
