This is a long one just to prewarn you all!  \r\nA couple of weeks back my mum had to be rushed down to the GP practice to be urgently seen due to an issue with her right foot. I would like to thank Dr Jegunma for her assessment and understanding with my mums issue, and how she displayed great kindness which settled my mums anxiety surrounding doctors instantly. The following morning due to not hearing so quickly as we had hoped from the hospital to see which department she was to be admitted to, I was pleased to say that ACP Pauline was on the case first thing and managed to arrange an emergency admission via ED. I’m aware she spend most of her morning sorting this out and we are all very grateful for this!  \r\nFollowing blood tests and X-rays in ED mum was admitted to orthopaedics for treatment of osteomyelitis. Unfortunately the following day we were told the news that mum would lose her leg from above the knee due to critical limb ischemia and severe osteomyelitis.  \r\nWe were all shocked and devastated how quickly this happened but thanks to all the staff during her stay she made the most amazing recovery and was discharged home just in time for Christmas.  \r\nI would like to thank everyone involved in my mums care. You were all amazing and worth your weight in gold!  \r\nSpecial thank yous too (apologies as this is a long list and sorry if you are not mentioned as never got everyone’s individual names).  \r\nED staff- thank you to ED reg Laura, and nurses Bethan, Abigail, Fiona and Jackie! You guys made a stressful situation for my mum much more eased thank you!  \r\nOrthopaedics ward 212- student nurse Chi for your kind welcome, FY1 John, Mr Bodie and his team - I really appreciate the time you took to call me to explain the plan with my mum. Some more thank yous to nurses Heather (day shift) and Lorna (night shift) for all your excellent care and compassion towards my mum you both helped ease a scary and stressful situation for her!  \r\nSpecial thanks to David (recovery nurse) for phoning me when mum was out of theatre- I’m aware mum made you do this, but very thankful you took the time for a quick update!  \r\nHDU ward 217- you guys are amazing at what you do! Mum was so well looked after by you all and we are so appreciative! Thanks go to Dawn, Joe, Claire, Devi and Student nurse Iona and there were so many more of you guys but can’t remember all your names I’m so sorry!  \r\nVascular ward 215- well you guys are amazing! Honestly what a team! Between all the doctors & nurses, your team of physios and OTs are unreal and honestly I never realised how much work you guys do and you are all fabulous! How you all supported and managed give mum back her independence after such a life changing operation is unreal and we are all so thankful! Special thank yous again to nurses Brian, Margaret, Brittany, Colleen, Lynn, Betsy, Leanne, student Alisha, Physio Karen and Sandy and OTs Mary and Amy and the rest of your teams in 215.  \r\nMr Mirghani- literally you are unlike any consultant surgeon I have ever met! You have an attitude to your work that needs to be commended like no other. You are so motivating and positive and clearly enjoy both your job and spending time with your patients with supporting them through their journey from start to finish and likely then some more!  \r\nFrom the moment we spoke on the phone and you explained all mums CT scan results to me (I have a nursing background myself) I knew from your kind voice and personality that my mum was in brilliant hands! Once I had the pleasure of meeting you before and after mums operation you are clearly a man that is fully invested in your work and your patients! All of the staff love working with you and can’t help but say to how brilliant you are! I’m sure you are aware of this but it needs to be shouted from the roof tops! Thank you Mr Mirghani and your team for saving my mums life and giving her the hope and motivation she needs to carry on!  \r\nYou are all amazing and please keep it up!! You have made me realise how proud I am to work for the NHS!","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-01-04T17:36:41.4933333","progress":"Story has a

She took me through sat down and spoke through what was bothering me and reassured me about what I could do to help me and told me how I’d make a good mum when my little boy arrives she really made me feel better and even let me hear my boy for the first time, really made my day. I couldn’t have asked for a more friendly face for a chat at this busy and stressful time.

Other trusts updated their guidance according to the government updates, but Musgrove have not. We paid for a private scan as feel the hospital ruin this experience for expectant parents when their reasoning makes no sense.  \r\nWhen I attended for my 12 week scan, apprehensive and struggling with being alone for this appointment, the sonographer was just wonderful. Super friendly, chatted through everything that would happen, took time finding the perfect pictures of our baby and explaining what could be seen. Their whole manner made such a difference to what's been a disappointing and messy journey so far.  \r\nI am also an NHS staff member and I feel it's important to share my experience from a patient perspective.
