We were left with this information and advised a consultant would be in touch with us. We heard nothing, had no contact with anyone about this diagnosis, no support, no guidance on what to expect as her condition progressed. Despite us contacting the dementia team and requesting a follow-up review as mum's condition was deteriorating quite rapidly, again we were advised a consultant would be in touch.

I was admitted with abdominal pain and was cared for rapidly and very kindly. They were relatively full that evening so I was in another bay with 2 women and their partners, I feel I may have scared them with my pain as I wasn't the quietest. I am unable to remember much of my stay due to the pain, but my husband keeps telling me how wonderful all the staff on triage and Rubislaw were.  \r\nOn my second visit, I called with reduced movements. On the phone I was greeted with a staff member who appeared very dismissive of my concerns. I was given the advice to stay at home for 1-2 hours to monitor baby's movements, which I understand is protocol but I explained I had already tried the methods to get baby to move, this was dismissed by the staff member and they said for me to call back in 2 hours if I still needed their help, then abruptly hung up. This experience made me very uncomfortable, especially when I had to call back later as I continued to have reduced movements. Thankfully someone else picked up the phone and was much more friendly, I believe this was after a shift change. This experience made me feel like my instincts were wrong and that when I was calling triage I was being accused of lying about my baby's movements when I was just concerned.  \r\nMy third experience was much better, I called with reduced movements. The midwife on the phone asked the questions about trying to lie on my left side etc. When I informed them I had tried these, I was immediately believed and asked to attend. We were seen to very quickly and had a CTG monitoring and my vital signs checked promptly. The midwife was so supportive, when he could see we were anxious he recognised this and talked to me and my husband until we felt less anxious. We couldn't fault the care or staff during this visit and we were very reassured about baby's movements following this visit.  \r\nDespite having 2 good experiences in triage, the second experience has made me extremely fearful to call triage again incase I am treated the same way.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-02-08T08:59:43.68","progress":"Story has a

Even my contact in Lanarkshire Carer Centre has been unable to pursue this on my behalf. I have spent the last 6 months being passed from pillar to post and am totally disillusioned and frustrated that I am having to battle constantly to even get to first base with Social Work and discuss something which is a statutory entitlement.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-02-07T16:39:48.4866667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-02-10T10:43:37.803","readBy":[{"name":"North Lanarkshire Health & Social Care Partnership","count":5},{"name":"Voluntary Action North Lanarkshire","count":1},{"name":"North Lanarkshire Advocacy","count":1},{"name":"Partnership for Change","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/820332","id":"820332"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/820332/responses","id":"820332"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/820332/healthservices","id":"820332"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/820332/tags","id":"820332"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/cumbernauld-socialwork-65","id":"cumbernauld-socialwork-65","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frustrated","id":"frustrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20frustrated","id":"very frustrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care%20planning","id":"care planning"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disillusioned","id":"disillusioned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/social%20services","id":"Social Services"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/passed%20around","id":"passed around"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/820599","id":"820599"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/820880","id":"820880"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/821277","id":"821277"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/832712","id":"832712"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/832920","id":"832920"}]},{"id":820361,"author":"Fayre","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Telephone answering service","body":"Rang endoscopy department in a panic about a Covid test pre treatment.

She was excellent and put my mind at ease, showing compassion throughout.  \r\nI was transferred to ward A1 where I was put under the supervision of Natalie.  \r\nI think Natalie has 2 twins who work alongside her as she was everywhere doing everything, really showing me how to multitask!  \r\nThe care and attention shown from start to finish was brilliant and worthy of this mention as during these times we need to help each other in whatever way you can.

My mothers cervix actually closed over and she needed an operation he middle of last year to pierce a small hole to relieve the build up of blood.  \r\nSo, months later she was awoken at 3am due to the feeling as though she had peed herself and in a lot of pain in her lower abdomen to find out that she had been bleeding, her pyjama bottoms were soaked in blood the floor and toilet seat was covered in blood and she counted around ten blood clots in the toilet that she had passed. As her daughter i phoned the cancer helpline we were given as up to 8 weeks after treatment thats the best place to phone for 24hr cancer advice. they phoned our local hospital The Victoria Hospital in Kirkcaldy and was told to immediately go over. When we arrived at A&E the triage nurse was waiting for us and took us right through and done my mothers obs etc then taken us through to a bed further into a&e to be seen by a doctor. The doctor was brilliant although they hadn’t checked my mothers notes and it wasn’t until we mentioned that she was actually a cancer patient is when the doctor said they would go and have a look at her notes.  \r\nFast forward an hour and we were taken up into the gynaecologist ward. The nurse that had first came in also done my mums obs again and told us that she was told by a&e that my mothers bloods had been taken which was false as they hadn’t taken any bloods nor did they mention anything about her needing bloods to us. Another doctor had came in a while later to examine my mums stomach by touching etc and said thry would need another doctor to do the vaginal examination. to which a male doctor also joined with when they done the vaginal examination. When they carried out the examination my mother bled even more and soaked through onto the tissue and bed and also on the floor. The female doctor told us and the other doctor that she could feel something inside of her and was unsure what this was, the male doctor then felt inside and said he felt nothing he proceeded to ask my mum if there was a chance of pregnancy or STD’s and also asked if anything had been done to her cervix as it was very small, this was clear enough to see he had not read her notes or he would have known why her cervix was this small and how there would be no chance of pregnancy. She was sent away home within 5 minutes after the examination they handed her a couple of wipes to clean her vaginal area and was told she was fine to go home even though she was still passing bloody very heavily. She had to remove her blood soaking pad from the bed herself as nobody had removed this and nobody had came back to see her if she was okay. when she was cleaning herself up in the bathroom there was blood on the floor that was dried up which was obviously not my mothers and we had informed the staff of this which to me that is very poor infection control as it was someone else’s blood. Her discharge note that she got given had claimed this was due to the small operation she had months before this or a period. Again, this is another clear statement as to them not reading her notes due to impossibility of her not being able to pass a period.  \r\nFast forward to now my mother is now passing heavily blood with clots again and has informed her cancer nurse to which they have now fast forwarded her scan due to them being unsure of whats going on and my mother had a conversation with her cancer nurse about this time in hospital and her cancer nurse had said herself that it is impossible for it to be a period due to again the impossibility of my mum passing a period.  \r\nMy mum now refuses to go to Victoria hospital due to the way she was treated and felt very violated. I didn’t actually want to write this but i don’t want anybody to experience what my mum has went through. I’m not saying all doctors are like this as i’ve seen some amazing doctors that’s helped my mum and even my family through the past 6 years but the way she’s been treated this time is horrific. As a 19 year old girl i shouldn’t have to be writing this but my mum but she should get the compassion and care she deserves. this is highlighted very well on the nhs website and should apply to everyone not just my mum.  \r\nthank you for your time.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-02-05T21:58:36.5266667","progress":"Story has a

I have Power of Attorney and am also responsible for her care.  \r\nFollowing the advice put out by the Scottish Government and NHS Scotland, I had held off contacting my Mum’s doctor, but having heard nothing I contacted her GP practice in late January. I was advised that I should speak to the District Nurses, who I called the following Monday morning. I was then advised that I should again speak to Mum’s GP practice. The GP surgery advised me that there had been a mix up and that my mother was on the \"Housebound List\" but still couldn’t tell me when she would receive her jab because the vaccine was being administered by a team that was not connected to the practice.  \r\nThe GP surgery advised me when I called again later in the week that she may not get her vaccination until the following week but still could not tell me when this would be, only that the vaccination team would contact my mother or me before visiting. When I called again on the Friday they again confirmed she was on the \"Housebound List” and they thought the vaccination team may be working over the weekend. However, it is now the end of the weekend and we have still not heard anything.  \r\nMy Mum is becoming increasingly concerned that she has not yet been vaccinated and that the message being put out by the Scottish and UK governments and the news media is at odds with her own experience.  \r\nToday I called the Public Health Scotland Coronavirus Helpline to see if they could help, or at least shed some light on my mother's situation. Unfortunately, despite much sympathy and patient listening to my Mum's story, after 4 phone calls, passing me from \"option 2\" to \"option 1\" and back again, I was none the wiser - in fact less so, since the Helpline could find no record of my Mum's CHI number so it would appear that she is not even on the system.  \r\nThe Coronavirus Helpline said they could do no more but gave me contact details advising me to make a complaint to the NHS and Greater Glasgow & Clyde Health Board. I said I wasn't trying to make a complaint and that I was just trying to make sure my Mum did not slip through the net, however, the helpline advisor suggested this would be the best way for me to go about it. I am now in the process of going through the various links and phone numbers although many seem to be Page not found or have messages along the lines of The feedback service is temporarily suspended as our teams are supporting management of the coronavirus (COVID-19) helpline.  \r\nMeanwhile, the Scottish Government has said its Covid vaccination programme is exceeding expectations and that at 93% coverage it had met it's target to vaccinate the over 80s by the 5 February.  \r\nThe other 7% percent includes people like my mother and not just those who are unable or unwilling to receive the jag. They say that the programme is delivering ahead of expectations but I am worried that the focus is now on larger, younger groups and that some of the most vulnerable people, like my mother, are now being left behind.  \r\nI am contacting here to do all that I can to bring my mother's case to the attention of those in charge of the delivery of the vaccine so that my mother and those in a similar situation are not forgotten by those charged with their care.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-02-07T13:29:45.7866667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-02-10T11:49:51.307","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":4}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/820326","id":"820326"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/820326/responses","id":"820326"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/820326/healthservices","id":"820326"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/820326/tags","id":"820326"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sj9-covid-vaccination-programme","id":"SJ9-Covid-Vaccination-Programme","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sj9-general-practices","id":"sj9-general-practices","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/abandoned","id":"abandoned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confused","id":"confused"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20listening","id":"not listening"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/worried","id":"worried"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/availability","id":"availability"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/concerned","id":"concerned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/delivery","id":"delivery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/forgotten","id":"forgotten"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/information","id":"information"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/telephone%20system","id":"telephone system"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vaccination","id":"vaccination"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vulnerable","id":"vulnerable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/website","id":"website"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/coronavirus","id":"coronavirus"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/passed%20around","id":"passed around"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/820868","id":"820868"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/820942","id":"820942"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/821276","id":"821276"}]},{"id":820637,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Fantastic friendly staff","body":"I recently had day surgery and was so impressed and grateful for the way I was treated by all the staff .

A day after my surgery things went downhill and I could not eat or drink without throwing it back up. I could barely stand up as I was in severe pain and the times I tried to walk I ended up throwing up.  \r\nI was moved onto the main ward on ward 21 after a few days and I was constantly ignored. My abdomen was hard and swollen and I was still unable to eat or drink. There was one night where I was in severe pain and it took over four hours for me to receive pain relief because the nurse I kept asking forgot to tell the nurse in charge. My last day on the ward ended up with me being left in the toilet after telling the nurse that I am unable to wash myself. I had been waiting for my mum to visit everyday for her to help me. After struggling to walk back to my bed I ended up throwing up again.  \r\nI was then told I was being moved onto ward 11 and the Porter came to take me.

I had a call back from the dr on wednesday as I was unwell in bed .. he said the reception team will call me back with a blood form. I received no call back. I called Thursday morning and they told me ‘oh we haven’t done anything with that yet’. The dr is in a meeting all morning but we will call you later’ . Again- heard nothing. So I called back at 6pm and they told me it’s been posted to you. I asked for an email copy and they said ‘ oh we are far too busy to email this to you as we are so busy answering the phones. Call back next week if you haven’t received it in the post..’ what an absolute joke!  Drs are good but the admin is awful. So unhelpful. They have no manners and are just so rude.. I understand there are pressures at the moment but being rude to people when they are ill and poorly is NOT helping anyone . If you don’t like your job - quit. There are plenty of people would love your job who would have the manners and empathy to be able to do it.

The first time I got through to a nurse who said he had had various tests but they were awaiting the outcome of those.  Aware of how manic the department must be at that time I called back approx four hours later and a male voice answered the number I had been given.  Wondering if this was a doctor I asked and the person said ‘No, I’m only a Porter, but how can I help you’?  I said he was just as important as everyone else in the hospital and to not sell himself cheap and then explained I was trying to speak to a doctor about my husband.  He said he understood, asked me to wait a second and within a couple of minutes the doctor came on the ‘phone!\nI was so impressed the Porter took it upon himself to find the doctor and explain to him I was very concerned about my husband.  The doctor continued to then tell me the outcome of the tests etc.\nThe purpose of leaving this review is I hope that Porter sees this review and remembers talking to me, and how grateful I am to him for his part in my husbands recovery.
