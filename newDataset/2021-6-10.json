After 5 yearly mammograms I was called for my routine one at Edgware Hospital. 3 days later I got a letter calling me back. I was given more mammograms, an ultrasound and a biopsy. The staff at this hospital were lovely, particularly when I was having the biopsy. A week later I went to Northwick Park Hospital for my results and was told I had cancer on the left side. This was just before Christmas and during COVID-19 times. I was given an appointment for a lumpectomy at Clementine Churchill hospital and opted to wait until January. Just before then I was told it would be delayed for a week - with everything that was going on with Covid at that time this was the only delay I experienced.  \r\nI had a lovely surgeon, Mr Lee, a very kind man who took into account my own feelings about the scars I would have. At Clementine Churchill the team were great - I was very nervous about the anaesthetic after being very ill previously. This time was completely different and so very much better. I came round from the operation and was back in my room with some lunch in an hour! I was very impressed with care and kindness I was shown at this hospital.  \r\nSince then I have seen Dr Gayadeen at Northwick Park Hospital who was very kind and gentle.

I did not know where to turn or where to get help from, we had an incident where she went missing so I had to get help, and quickly! I was told to contact the mental health crisis team and seek their help, this I did and they told me to put down the phone and ring the police, this I did.  \r\nEverything turned out fine but this was the very beginning of my adventure with the Nottinghamshire NHS Mental Health Support Team. I do now know after eighteen months of turmoil and dread that this was a pivotal moment in my wife and me coming to terms and dealing with my wife’s Illness.  \r\nI and my wife have met some lovely people who have helped immensely since the early onset of her mental psychosis. I honestly thought my wife would not return to normality and our life going forwards would never be the same. We had dreams and plans for our future that seemed a million miles away from us now. And sometimes alone at night I would have a little cry over this as I felt robbed of our future.  \r\nAll I have said though with the right care and support from the mental health teams I was assured everything would be alright. I was not convinced because with every step we took forwards something unforeseen would come along and push us back again. But now eighteen months from the start of all of this we have a massive tunnel with a world full of light shining through it and allowing us to see our future again.  \r\nAll of this due to the efforts of so many people, the guys at Kings Mill Hospital for all the help they provided because we could not see our own GP, the Mental Health Crisis Team who became like an extension to our family, they helped us in ways too numerous to mention and they were so patient with my wife I can’t thank them enough.  \r\nThen when our care was transferred to North Gate in Newark, into the wonderful hands of Louise the nursing care coordinator and the psychiatrist things started to change. They tweaked the medicines my wife was on and this was amazing. I now got to see my wife with a smile on her face again.  \r\nShe now rides again (horses) her passion since the age of eight, and slowly we are emerging into our world again the one I thought I would lose for ever. I now take part in the Newark Carer Support group with Laura E, Alice & Laura R this has given me an extra insight into the problem We have had and the way we can support each other.  \r\nMy wife also has joined Rob the CBTp Therapist Supervisor which my wife says has been a major breakthrough for her regarding her agoraphobia. All of the carers support and the new course I have just started Carer Education and Support Program were overseen by Andrea and Laura from the Family Interventions Team at Bassetlaw Hospital Worksop.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-06-08T14:13:55.7566667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-06-10T12:27:21.66","readBy":[{"name":"Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust","count":32},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2022)","count":1},{"name":"Sheffield University Medical School 2021","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/852099","id":"852099"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/852099/responses","id":"852099"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/852099/healthservices","id":"852099"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/852099/tags","id":"852099"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rha-amh-city-carers","id":"rha-amh-city-carers","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rha-amh-county-fit","id":"rha-amh-county-fit","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rha-amh-county-ns","id":"rha-amh-county-ns","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rhabw","id":"RHABW","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rha-crisis-midnotts","id":"rha-crisis-midnotts","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/agoraphobia","id":"agoraphobia"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care%20coordinator","id":"care coordinator"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/carers%20group","id":"carers group"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cbt%20therapist","id":"CBT therapist"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/crisis%20team","id":"Crisis Team"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/family%20support","id":"family support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20illness","id":"mental illness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/psychiatrist","id":"psychiatrist"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported","id":"supported"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/853173","id":"853173"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/853204","id":"853204"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/853676","id":"853676"}]},{"id":852110,"author":"PoxyRoxy1","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Helpful team","body":"I find the whole team very helpful and they helped me when going through very bad periods of my life,  \r\nI love attending appointments and always feel welcomed, I enjoyed all the various groups I attend at Wisbech, No matter how I felt, there was always someone to talk to.

I am also seeing face to face the national heart failure service in Glasgow however as I understand it I still need to be under the care of Forth Valley as this is where I will be sent should I suffer a episode and require Immediate hospital assistance.  \r\nI have only met my cardiologist once before and that was back in December last year after my initial diagnosis by a private cardiologist and at the time the cause of my illness was not understood & I had only just started to be prescribed the required medicines for my conditions. Since then I have had three echocardiograms one of which was at fourth Valley Hospital and 2 MRI scans. The results of these and consultation notes have all been copied into my cardiologist. So, When this doctor phoned me I was extremely surprised that they hadn’t taken the time to read any of this information sent to them and the only pieces of information they had was their notes of December last year and a list of my current medication. Since their notes were written the assumption that the cause of my condition was caused by the infection had been disproved by the 2MRI scans. As well this doctor had not spoken to the heart nurse who they said was responsible for increasing my medication. How can I have confidence in a unit when they do not take the time to read correspondence and results sent to them. They even suggested making a change to my current medication without knowing the full history. I do not understand what my cardiologist expected to get out of the consultation as they clearly showed no interest in understanding what had happened in the last seven months regarding my treatment. All its done for me is give me additional stress and concern.As patients we are expected to attend appointments, provide information as requested, surely the least we can expect is for Doctors to be well prepared.

Once I was called back in to discuss what they found, I was told everything was normal and that my symptoms were due to my “anxiety” and was directly told there’s nothing we can do for you.  \r\nI was also told that I should go back to my GP which also confused me because my GP had already prescribed me everything they could to help with these symptoms and none of it helped, so how will they be able to help me now?

I was taken to theatre last so was hanging around quite a long time and could have started to feel anxious, however on a regular basis one of the staff checked in with me to have a chat, offer me food and a drink, and check I was OK. In the theatre someone sat beside me and chatted to me the whole time, to make sure I stayed relaxed. The surgeon was chatty and reassuring. A nice touch post-op was to give me a heated blanket to make me comfortable.  \r\nI might have thought I had just been lucky, but I subsequently spoke to a friend who had also had the same operation at St John's and, unsolicited, they mentioned how wonderful the teams had been.  \r\nPlease pass on my thanks to the relevant people.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-06-08T14:50:20.8366667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-06-10T13:07:48.33","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lothian","count":5}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/852102","id":"852102"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/852102/responses","id":"852102"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/852102/healthservices","id":"852102"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/852102/tags","id":"852102"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/s308h_100","id":"S308H_100","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxious","id":"anxious"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/apprehensive","id":"apprehensive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/attentive","id":"attentive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/balance","id":"balance"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blanket","id":"blanket"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/brilliant","id":"brilliant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/check%20in","id":"check in"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/efficient","id":"efficient"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly%20staff","id":"friendly staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/great","id":"great"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hand","id":"hand"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/information","id":"information"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/knowledgeable%20staff","id":"Knowledgeable Staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lucky","id":"lucky"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/operating%20team","id":"operating team"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/operation","id":"operation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/outpatient%20clinic","id":"Outpatient clinic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgeon","id":"surgeon"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thorough","id":"thorough"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassuring","id":"reassuring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/relaxed","id":"relaxed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/offered%20refreshments","id":"offered refreshments"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thanks","id":"thanks"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/chatting","id":"chatting"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/853191","id":"853191"}]},{"id":852179,"author":"coop4418","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Combined Gastroscopy and Colonoscopy","body":"Not the most comfortable of procedures but was well looked after by doctors and nurses.

Some of them they don’t treat me with care.  \r\nThey know that I was first time mum, I need support and help from them especially it was Covid time, so no visitors allowed to stay with me at night.  \r\nI had twins, so it’s difficult for me, I had caesarean delivery, I’m in adjustment period, why some of midwives in Royal Free doesn’t think that way. Then on my last night staying, they need to transfer me to isolation room.  \r\nOn following day, one of midwives asking me “what time my husband coming to pick me up?\" Because she told me that they need the isolation room and need to clean it first before the other patient to come. I was surprised how she told me that and I felt that she wants to get rid of me immediately.  \r\nMy midwife who was assigned to me, we were just started, she just telling me in a rushing way about my discharge letter, medicines and health information. She did that because the other midwife needs the room that I was using. I felt these midwives didn’t treat me right, they didn’t respect me, they didn’t give me proper health education or any health information.  \r\nI felt that they don’t deserve their profession. Some of them, maybe they don’t know the right meaning of maternity, ante/post natal care or even their profession called \"midwife\".  \r\nI chose to deliver my babies in Royal Free because I thought I was in a safe environment, with genuine caring and to be with professional midwives, but I regret it. I had post partum depression. I hope unprofessional midwives will have further training and continuous supervision. They should know how to give support, help and care to all mothers who just had delivered their babies (normal or caesarean delivery), whether first time mum or many times.  \r\nIf they don’t improve, they should go back to university and study again. They should learn their professional ethics and responsibilities.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-06-08T23:46:59.3033333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-06-10T15:26:25.687","readBy":[{"name":"Sheffield University Medical School 2021","count":1},{"name":"Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/852217","id":"852217"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/852217/responses","id":"852217"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/852217/healthservices","id":"852217"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/852217/tags","id":"852217"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/ral01_501","id":"RAL01_501","score":2},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20cared%20for","id":"not cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/catering%20staff","id":"catering staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/delivery","id":"delivery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disrespectful","id":"disrespectful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/isolation","id":"isolation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/job%20responsibilities","id":"job responsibilities"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/maternity","id":"maternity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/midwives","id":"midwives"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20helpful","id":"not helpful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/postnatal%20depression","id":"postnatal depression"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/some%20staff","id":"some staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unhappy","id":"unhappy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20disappointed","id":"very disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/housekeeper","id":"housekeeper"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/regret","id":"regret"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attitudes","id":"staff attitudes"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/923551","id":"923551"}]},{"id":852244,"author":"Lings Bar","authorRoleId":7,"authorRole":"a staff member posting for a carer/relative","title":"Heartfelt Thanks","body":"To all the staff of Castle ward,  \r\nWith heartfelt thanks for all your kindness and devotion to the care of our mother.  \r\nWe will never forget your sympathy for our concerns and Mums comfort.  \r\nThanks You  \r\nFrom all the family  \r\nGrand children  \r\nGreat grand children and partners of.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-06-09T08:56:14.91","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-06-10T15:27:00.403","readBy":[{"name":"Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust","count":7}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/852244","id":"852244"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/852244/responses","id":"852244"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/852244/healthservices","id":"852244"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/852244/tags","id":"852244"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rhann-inpatient","id":"RHANN-inpatient","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/great","id":"great"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thanks","id":"thanks"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/855673","id":"855673"}]},{"id":852251,"author":"mfin567","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Professional staff","body":"I went to the X ray department at Omagh hospital and all the staff were very friendly and professional, there was very little waiting around and I was seen quickly.

The GP stated that his practice would not be able to complete bloods so my father would need to attend an appointment at ED at 6pm to get these and any other investigations completed.  \r\nWhen we arrived at ED the department was extremely busy. There was a queue of about 10 people waiting to speak to the reception staff (this level of queue continued for a large part of the following 5 hours). The waiting time for triage was 1 hour and following this 5hrs for minors and majors. The majority of people presenting at ED reported they had been sent there by primary care.  \r\nDespite the pressures I can only commend the reception staff for their patience in dealing with this level of pressure, and finding creative solutions to support families whose first language is not English (eg \"got a mobile? Show me your name on your phone.\")  \r\nAs a health service worker I fully understand the COVID environment. The reception area was very busy. Every half hour until 8pm one of the nursing staff loudly announced that only patients should be in the reception area and that others should return to their cars to wait. While I fully understand her concern and frustration, it would perhaps have been helpful if she had added \"unless the patient is a vulnerable patient - but please do give chairs to patients\". I did not use a chair, but I wouldn't have left my 88 year old father alone in the waiting area.  \r\nAdditionally I challenged the request to wait outside while my father was triaged, and accompanied my father into triage. This was necessary as he needed support to hear information and retain it. The triage nurse completed her examination and was very kind and supportive.  \r\nWe had a long wait following triage. This was due in part to the very high number of attendees who had been sent to ED by primary care.  \r\nWhen we were called through to see a doctor the service was exceptionally good. The doctor (Nathan) had excellent communication skills and spoke clearly and directly to my father. He also actively listened to what my father had to say. He displayed all of the HSC values and treated my father with kindness and compassion.  \r\nA CT scan was arranged for the following morning and we returned at 9am, scan completed at 10am, given feedback from doctor and medication by 11.30am.  \r\nIn conclusion, I would like to thank all of the ED team at AAH for the work they do under the extreme pressures that currently exist in the system.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-06-09T10:43:47.1733333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-06-10T15:38:08.237","readBy":[{"name":"Northern Health and Social Care Trust","count":8},{"name":"Public Health Agency","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/852310","id":"852310"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/852310/responses","id":"852310"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/852310/healthservices","id":"852310"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/852310/tags","id":"852310"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt002_24027_180","id":"ZT002_24027_180","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20being%20listened%20to","id":"not being listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20listened%20to","id":"not listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ct%20scan","id":"CT scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/excellent","id":"excellent"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scan","id":"scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support%20from%20carers","id":"support from carers"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/triage","id":"triage"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vulnerable","id":"vulnerable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting%20time","id":"waiting time"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%2019","id":"covid 19"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/under%20pressure","id":"under pressure"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/855679","id":"855679"}]},{"id":852139,"author":"dracoxh53","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Health Check Up","body":"After having a general health check about some concerns I had with aches and pains, I was happily surprised how professional and caring Pauline was - she is an angel.

I have recovered brilliantly and I cannot thank you all enough. \n","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2021-05-27T20:27:03","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-06-10T16:21:11","readBy":[{"name":"University Hospitals of Derby and Burton NHS Foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/853219","id":"853219"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/853219/responses","id":"853219"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/853219/healthservices","id":"853219"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/853219/tags","id":"853219"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rtg02","id":"RTG02","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20cared%20for","id":"not cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20about","id":"Cared about"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hysterectomy","id":"hysterectomy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/operation","id":"operation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/well%20looked%20after","id":"well looked after"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20for","id":"cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/under%20pressure","id":"under pressure"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/991332","id":"991332"}]},{"id":853220,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"No reply to E-consult","body":"Had an X-ray in August 2020, no one called me with the result.\n\nI called 3 weeks later, was told I had degenerative osteoarthritus by the call handler but this person clearly wasn't medically trained when I asked questions so arranged a doctor to call me.\nDoctor called and said he would refer me to a specialist.\n\nIn March 2021 I did an e-consult (as I could never get through on the phone) and asked for a referral letter so I could go private.\nNot been contacted about it as of yet (27/05/2021).\nI thought your policy was to make contact within 48 hours!\n","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2021-05-27T22:39:20","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-06-10T16:22:09","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/853220","id":"853220"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/853220/responses","id":"853220"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/853220/healthservices","id":"853220"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/853220/tags","id":"853220"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/j82155","id":"J82155","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/x-ray","id":"X-ray"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/911318","id":"911318"}]},{"id":853224,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"No PPE","body":"Went for a consultation due to illness out of hours.

The appointment booking process is very broken. The patients are not allowed to booked any appointments online and are only allowed to book appointment via phone call. After multiple days of trying, if the patient is lucky to get through, they can only book one for the day and if there are no appointment available, they have to call back again to book for a different day. The receptionist is not friendly and helpful which made it even more difficult. I can fully understand that we are going through COVID and it has been difficult for GPs. But the whole process of working with their patients in this GP is completely broken and not efficient at all. When I received my booking confirmation via phone message, it sent a completely wrong time so I missed my appointment. Finally when I was able to be there for my appointment, my GP was extremely disorganized, dropping things everywhere, aggressively pulling out the drawers and looking for things. It doesn't feel like it is professional at all. While I was waiting at the GP, there were other elderly patients physically came to the practice complaining that they weren't able to pass through the call to make an appointment and demanding to see a GP directly. They were very frustrated and I can completely feel their pain. We are in 21st centuries, please use internet and all the new technologies to improve the efficiency of the practice. This doesn't mean remove phone booking as there are people who will need to use this service. It is not like all NHS are suffering slow adoption of new technologies, there are other GPs that are absolutely benefiting from them. If anyone from Rushey Green GP can see this, please look after the patients in your practice, making the whole process difficult might reduce your issues within the GP, but will not help your patients.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2021-06-02T09:55:37","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-06-10T16:48:26","readBy":[{"name":"Rushey Green GP","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/853231","id":"853231"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/853231/responses","id":"853231"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/853231/healthservices","id":"853231"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/853231/tags","id":"853231"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/g85633","id":"G85633","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frustrated","id":"frustrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20frustrated","id":"very frustrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/broken","id":"broken"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/elderly","id":"elderly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lucky","id":"lucky"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid","id":"covid"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%2019","id":"covid 19"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/908822","id":"908822"}]},{"id":853230,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Extremely reliable team","body":"I have been with the surgery since 8 years and I find them extremely professional and helpful.

Just today, Friday 4th June when I rang and spoke with a member of staff she was caring, skilled, and efficient in dealing with my query and concern, which brought much reassurance to me as a patient.
