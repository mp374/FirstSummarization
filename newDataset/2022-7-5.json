The trial started in September 2021 and was a success and the treatment made a big difference to my quality of life and we agreed to continue the treatment.  \r\nUnfortunately, whilst the treatment has been approved for use in Scotland by SIGN, and is used by other health boards in Scotland, I have experienced continuous problems with NHS Tayside in seeking to have the prescription authorised for on-going treatment. Since the original trial, I have had to continually chase NHS Tayside in order to have this treatment continued. I have relied on the efforts of the administration staff within the department who have been able to arrange with the company for me to have temporary extensions to the prescription. I would like to acknowledge and commend their efforts to help me. However, each time there has been a break in the treatment which has caused worsening of my symptoms and my quality of life.  \r\nIn January 2022, I was advised that the company providing the treatment device would not extend the prescription further until the necessary funding arrangements were put in place by NHS Tayside. In February, I contacted the relevant Service Manager within NHS Tayside as I had been advised that the final point in the authorisation process for my treatment was this person. Sadly, I never received a response from the Service Manager but, having also copied NHS Tayside’s Patient Feedback Department, was advised that a temporary extension had been agreed to provide NHS Tayside with time to put in place the funding process.  \r\nIn April I contacted NHS Tayside to request the renewal of the prescription as the temporary extension was due to end. I was told the treatment couldn’t be extended because the process had not been put in place yet. As I result, my treatment stopped and my condition has deteriorated significantly.  \r\nI am at a loss to understand why I am being denied a treatment that my specialist has prescribed, which is authorised for use in Scotland; has improved my quality of life; and is available in other health boards in Scotland. I feel like this is a post-code lottery and I am being significantly disadvantaged to the detriment of my health and wellbeing. Not only have the breaks in my treatment worsened my condition but the additional pressure and stress of having to constantly chase NHS Tayside for this treatment to continue is also causing an exacerbation of my symptoms.  \r\nThis is not person-centred, safe and effective care and due to the failings of NHS Tayside, my health has been harmed. I am being badly let down by NHS Tayside due to failures of administration. The response to date from Tayside has been to open another complaint with a timescale for resolution of 20 working days, albeit the communication I received from NHS Tayside stated that this timescale was unlikely to be met. 20 days has passed and I’ve been told that I might get a response in another 20 working days. All the while I am left suffering and my health deteriorating","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-06-06T19:08:12.66","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-07-05T08:26:37.137","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Tayside","count":10},{"name":"Aberdeen City Health & Social Care Partnership","count":1},{"name":"Scottish Government","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/945011","id":"945011"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/945011/responses","id":"945011"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/945011/healthservices","id":"945011"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/945011/tags","id":"945011"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/t101h_400","id":"T101H_400","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/t202h_400","id":"T202H_400","score":1},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/badly%20let%20down","id":"badly let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/complaint","id":"Complaint"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disadvantaged","id":"disadvantaged"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/funding","id":"funding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/person-centred","id":"person-centred"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/prescription","id":"Prescription"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/response","id":"response"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unnecessary%20suffering","id":"unnecessary suffering"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/admin%20staff","id":"admin staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/some%20staff%20members","id":"some staff members"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/954843","id":"954843"}]},{"id":953565,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Absolutely great treatment","body":"I cannot praise enough the treatment my husband received in the A & E Department at Maidstone Hospital.

I left feeling humiliated and embarrassed.  \r\nPlease educate your staff on appropriate ways of talking to patients without letting personal opinions influence their work.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-06-30T15:28:31.4833333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-07-05T09:20:00.487","readBy":[{"name":"Spring Hill Practice","count":4},{"name":"City & Hackney GP Confederation","count":1},{"name":"Ulster University, MBBS (Medicine) 2021","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/952476","id":"952476"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/952476/responses","id":"952476"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/952476/healthservices","id":"952476"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/952476/tags","id":"952476"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/y03049","id":"Y03049","score":2},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/embarrassed","id":"embarrassed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cervical%20screening","id":"Cervical Screening"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/questions","id":"questions"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/uncomfortable","id":"uncomfortable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/humiliated","id":"humiliated"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/954518","id":"954518"}]},{"id":953576,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Great practice ","body":"Hi got high blood pressure have been seeing nurse she was very caring and helpful as are the doctors and staff ","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-07-05T09:19:04","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-07-05T09:20:45","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/953576","id":"953576"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/953576/responses","id":"953576"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/953576/healthservices","id":"953576"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/953576/tags","id":"953576"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/g82203","id":"G82203","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood","id":"blood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20pressure","id":"blood pressure"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/high%20blood%20pressure","id":"high blood pressure"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/under%20pressure","id":"under pressure"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/953887","id":"953887"}]},{"id":953210,"author":"bellajake91","authorRoleId":3,"authorRole":"a parent/guardian","title":"My baby’s referral goes missing after waiting 6 months","body":"I’m sad to tell my story . It is a sad time that is filled with anxiety, worry , sadness and pain. Seeing my 1 year old baby not getting the support from the specialists that she needs is soul destroying .  \r\nIt breaks me seeing her suffer and the system is failing her of no fault of her own .  \r\nIt started in December 2021 when my daughter was 13 months old and first went onto cows milk. She immediately showed signs of intolerance. She would have explosive diarrhoea within 2 hours of consuming it and a large painful allergy rash appeared .  \r\nAfter taking my Health Visitors (HV) advice and still no improvement A doctor referred us to the dietician in January 2022. I was told there would be a long wait due to Covid but they didn’t know how long.  \r\nThis wait time came with worry and anxiety. I didn’t know what was best to do with my daughters health. During this time my daughters symptoms worsened and we’ve never had any specialists help .  \r\nAfter 6 months of waiting and me regularly been told to just continue waiting. I was eventually told my daughters referral was never received. I was told it had gone missing. My HV discovered the referral was missing after directly contacting the dietician department .  \r\nThe dietician has advised we are referred to paediatrics and I’m absolutely devastated to have been told it’s going to be a 41 week wait.  \r\nWe’ve already waited over 6 /7months and now we are now told to wait an additional 10.5 months .  \r\nMy daughter has had a wheeze that started around the time of weaning her. Her breathing issues have needed hospitalisation, her wheeze comes randomly and strongly we know this can be triggered by an allergy but she has never been able to get tested, we don’t know what is causing it .  \r\nShe has red bumpy allergy rashes that appear on her face which come and go. Her nappies are so messy we can’t start potty training so this is now delaying her development. Her tummy bloats daily after food, it’s painful for her .  \r\nWe need to get my daughter prioritised. She needs an allergy test to find out if its triggering my daughters breathing issues. We need her bowels to be functioning normally so it doesn’t delay her development skills with potty training .  \r\nExperiencing all this as a first time mum has affected my trust in the system. It’s affected my mental and physical health. Seeing my helpless daughter being failed by the system by no fault of her own is not acceptable.  \r\nI want to know how this will be prevented in the future? What support with be given to parents?","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-07-04T09:47:05.0166667","progress":"Story has a

I recently was allocated a support worker after being offered one for the last 5 years without success. They were unfortunately non constructive with either advice or support. My mental well being was in meltdown for many weeks and they said I was fine. I was far from fine.  \r\nI was left during the week with the police at my door as I had got to stage of suicide. I made a call to this team and told a pending doctor appointment is in the pipeline, then 2 days later told I am discharged.  \r\nBeing under this service is unsafe as in my experience they turn a blind eye to how a patient is. As I have experienced and other patients, if someone calls this team they are asked what they should do as if they don`t know what to do.

A video consultation with 'A' who explained everything thoroughly beforehand and the types of bags you could have, the support available and then answered with great patience my numerous questions that put me thoroughly at ease, to meeting other nurses on the ward 'S and 'R' who sited the positioning accurately and 'R' who had the task after surgery to teach me about changing my bag, helped dispel the squeamishness I initially felt and made no fuss but calmy explained the best way to manage things I a dignified way. Taking all my fears away. This enabled me to leave hospital sooner as I felt fully able to manage my stoma myself at home. A follow up call on my return home to ensure I had everything I needed was appreciated and ongoing transfer to my local hospital was being dealt with swiftly and efficiently.

I had gone through the experience before a year ago, and thought my tiredness was unrelated to depression/anxiety.\n\nHowever, the therapist was very understanding of my situation and we worked together to fight the tiredness. The first week or two I didn't notice getting any better, but there was always actionable things to do after the sessions, lots of resources and I never left feeling like I didn't know what to do next.\n\nThe best part was the advice and little tidbits of information - about how emotions are an evolutionary advantage and not something to be discarded, about changing up the scheduling technique each week to see what sticks.\n\nAt one point we had a 2 week break. I found the 2 week break better than the 1 week breaks - I really had time to put the techniques into practice and come up with other questions. I'd recommend giving people the option to have 2 weeks in between sessions.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-07-05T12:11:03","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-07-05T13:43:51","readBy":[{"name":"South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/953693","id":"953693"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/953693/responses","id":"953693"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/953693/healthservices","id":"953693"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/953693/tags","id":"953693"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rv5cj","id":"RV5CJ","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/discarded","id":"discarded"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/better","id":"better"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/break","id":"break"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/depression","id":"depression"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/headaches","id":"headaches"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tiredness","id":"tiredness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/getting%20better","id":"getting better"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/struggling","id":"struggling"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/954308","id":"954308"}]},{"id":953154,"author":"augustyd34","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Treatment for a fall and head injury","body":"I had a bad fall at The House of Bruar Blair Atholl  \r\nAfter receiving first aid I went to The Pitlochry Community Hospital  \r\nI was seen and treated within 10 minutes of arrival.  \r\nI'm extremely grateful to the Nurse, Mary, who treated me, put me at ease and provided information for follow-up care.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-07-03T16:12:55.86","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-07-05T13:44:10.183","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Tayside","count":4},{"name":"Perth and Kinross Health & Social Care Partnership","count":3}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/953154","id":"953154"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/953154/responses","id":"953154"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/953154/healthservices","id":"953154"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/953154/tags","id":"953154"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/t320h-minor-injuries","id":"t320h-minor-injuries","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/concern","id":"concern"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/availability","id":"availability"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fall","id":"fall"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/follow%20up%20care","id":"Follow up care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/head%20injury","id":"head injury"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/information","id":"information"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurse","id":"nurse"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/seen%20quickly","id":"seen quickly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treated","id":"treated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20at%20ease","id":"put at ease"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20well%20looked%20after%20and%20cared%20for","id":"very well looked after and cared for"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/953979","id":"953979"}]},{"id":953201,"author":"Marpm83","authorRoleId":7,"authorRole":"a staff member posting for a carer/relative","title":"Made to feel welcome","body":"Made to feel very welcome.
