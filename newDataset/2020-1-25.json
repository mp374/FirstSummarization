My mum had had to called the access crisis team quite a few times. \n\nOne time was due to my thoughts of self injury and that I was struggling to deal with them. They simply told my mum to wait until I start my counselling, which I was on the waiting list for and it could take 6 months. \n\nI also struggle to talk to people over the phone due to my anxiety so I am unable to answer questions e.c.t. they literally just refuse to help due to this. Saying that theres nothing they can do. Even though you can tell that I am struggling considering I struggle to communicate through phone calls. Due to this, I cant tell them what my symptoms are anyhow I am feeling properly as i freeze up and refuse to speak. There should be a text message service for people who suffer with anxiety so it less stressful and so they can talk about their problems in more detail rather than freaking out over the phone and hang up e.c.t. Or actually try and arrange a day to come in and talk to someone in person. It's like that they think just because we are adults, that we don't suffer from anxiety and need support to talk to someone over the phone. \n\nThe only okay thing that they did was agree that I needed to go on antidepressants and said that they would contact my GP asap so I can be put on them, without the GP worrying about putting me on them. However, when I went to book an appointment to see my GP, they told me that they havent received a phone call or anything off Harplands.

It was very irritating to witness lots of other people being dealt with before me. I suspect that when I arrived, my papers were transferred from one pile to start another pile. As subsequent people arrived, their papers were put on top of mine, and so on. The pile of papers were then tackled by the next section working from the top of the pile and thus, I went from first position to virtually last. This was quite annoying and could easily be rectified if the papers were stacked properly or alternatively marked with the patient’s arrival time and then processed in that order.\n2.

On the first occasion it was to ask for advice given my husband's illness was deteriorating.  The receptionist was kind and efficient in her summary of the situation and arranged for a response team paramedic to attend.  He was very good and thorough in his tests....keeping me informed in language I could understand and not at all patronising.  His care, advice and concern for me and my husband was excellent.  Some week later, unfortunately, my husband's condition deteriorated again, on this occasion to a frightening level.  Once more the medical centre receptionist was efficient in her responses and concerned for me also.  She arranged for the paramedic, who visited before, to ring me and talk me through the situation.  Which he did with excellent recall of our circumstances.  As he was not on the visiting team that day he arranged for another member of the response team to visit on this occasion.  She was also excellent.  Very thorough in her tests and all the while reassuring me while waiting for an ambulance to take us to the hospital.  I wanted it known that all those that attended us on those occasions were professional and gave us the time and concern we required despite the heavy demands made on their services.  A credit to them and a credit to our NHS. We have been patients of this surgery for a number of years and this is not an isolated case of their good service.  My thanks to all.

It’s so bad you have to question if it’s not actually their intention to get rid of patients who require ongoing treatment - cost saving perhaps.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-01-25T22:29:30","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-01-26T09:17:50","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/734009","id":"734009"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/734009/responses","id":"734009"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/734009/healthservices","id":"734009"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/734009/tags","id":"734009"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/j82083","id":"J82083","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fantastic","id":"fantastic"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/734344","id":"734344"}]},{"id":734008,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Massively happy with this hospital ","body":"Well what can I say was taken in by ambulance following a post lumbar puncture was put into a cubicle with in 5-10 minutes of arrival seen strate away by a doctor was givin iv pain relief and fluids strate away obs was taken and blood test felt very well looked after from the time of arrival to discharge these hospitals don’t get the credit where due exceptional treatment by the nurses and doctor tonight  lovly friendly nurses and doctors thank you again for quickly sorting me out ","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-01-25T23:02:01","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-01-26T09:18:31","readBy":[{"name":"Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/734008","id":"734008"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/734008/responses","id":"734008"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/734008/healthservices","id":"734008"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/734008/tags","id":"734008"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rwp01","id":"RWP01","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood","id":"blood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20test","id":"blood test"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fluids","id":"fluids"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lumbar","id":"lumbar"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lumbar%20puncture","id":"lumbar puncture"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain%20relief","id":"pain relief"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/well%20looked%20after","id":"well looked after"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/738115","id":"738115"}]},{"id":734010,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Great work","body":"I’ve been for a dermatology appointment and I’ve been pleased surprised to see the efficiency and help of the consultant who assisted me.

I Saw an A&E Dr after 4.6 hours, but I did mind. The department was busy. Also a nurse came out to the waiting room every couple of hours, which is good. The Dr asked me  how I felt and what had happened, which I  explained. She said I needed to go to the waiting room and mental health lesion  would come to see me soon. However, I could not collar the volunteer making brews and he did me a  lovely coffee. Me and my carer were only in the waiting room 10 mins, before mental health lesion  called me  through and I was taken to Assessment B back to Room  1, where I'd seen the doctor. The Mental Health team  were brilliant and listened to all me and my carer had to say and formulated a plan to move forward. \n\nBut I have to give praise once again to the volunteer on the unit, as he made me and my carer a brew and bought me weetobix!

I was given a two sheet printed official hand-out detailing why the surgery had taken this decision and stating that in future I must place my prescription requests in the wooden letterbox in the surgery vestibule or post them using in both cases the green prescription stub from the month previous prescription or I could post the prescription request to the surgery or I could order the items using the NHS App. The surgery would not accept verbal requests but only written requests. I walked round to the surgery with difficulty to ask; 1: What is an APP as I don't own one or have a mobile phone? 2: Who is paying for the postage if I have to use the post for the prescription request. 3: How do I manage to get down to the surgery by 10.30 as required - I am nearly 74. 4: Where do I get the green stubs from as I have lost the previous ones.\nOn reaching the surgery the staff did not know anything about the letter that had been sent to the Pharmacy and couldn't help me. I walked (with difficulty again) back to the Pharmacy but the pharmacist would not supply my monthly prescription because of the letter which had been issued by the surgery.

During the consultation, the consultant ignored my request for a drink of water and said if I needed one then I can go and buy a cup of coffee and she was going to see another patient. I asked only for some water as I was there waiting for a full hour without anything to drink, no water machine or access to drinking water. I asked if she could ask a nurse to bring some water for me so I didn't miss my appointment but she/the doctor refused. Then she was on the phone for half of my consultation telling me that she was on call and had to take those calls. It was really upsetting and embarrassing for me even more that I had to listen to other people's/patients' medical issues while sitting opposite which was actually quite distressing as they about were leukaemia and some critical patients. The consultant did not find it inappropriate or unprofessional and I felt like a nuisance while she was on the phone although it was my own consultation time. She would also ask me questions in between the calls but did not seem to listen or interested in my answers. At the end she said she may see me before Christmas which was in two weeks time and then refer me for a biopsy and ct scan. However, I did not see her until six weeks later and had no biopsy arranged. I only got a letter for a ct scan only which was not explained to me at all by her or anyone else beforehand and I simply was too scared and unsure about to go through with. Lastly, when I asked the nurse whilst waiting about a toilet she pointed me to some door that was not marked as one and I couldn't open it as it was locked. When I tried to ask her to help me or show me another toilet she just ignored me, smirked and walked away. Summing up, no access to toilets, drinking water, information on how long the waiting time was going to be and why and once in, the consultant is more preoccupied and concerned with the calls than the patient in front of her. I do not even know how to describe it the whole experience apart from as a terrible one.

I had rebound tenderness, 10/10 pain, nausea and vomiting, a fever and eventually my blood test showed inflammation. On arriving, the receptionist smirked at me when I told her what was wrong. When I eventually saw the triage nurse he told me off for not having taken an ibuprofen. For 10/10 pain and internal bleeding. I was left waiting for hours sat on a hard plastic chair, in agony. With drunk patients with minor injuries pushing past me constantly. When my blood test eventually came back showing inflammation I was finally believed and an apologetic nurse took me to a bed. A doctor came to see me and tried again to send me home with ibuprofen. I had to explain to him what an endometrioma is, what happens when it ruptures, that I needed a scan and to see a gynaecologist. More hours later, after a CT scan showed internal haemorrhaging, as I had already explained it would, an apologetic gynaecologist admitted me and I was kept in for 2 nights for pain management and monitoring my haemoglobin. The consultant said I would need emergency surgery but fortunately I had excision surgery booked in the following week with accredited endometriosis specialists in Surrey. As there are none in Sussex.\n\nEndometriosis affects 5% of the population. It is unacceptable that there was so little knowledge of the condition amongst the staff. I had particularly severe disease, and an emergency situation, but was treated like a time waster with normal period pain. Other patients with the same problem might not have been in a position to advocate for themselves in order to get basic medical treatment. I suggest the A&E department has some training in endometriosis as well as unconscious bias training and stops dismissing female patients and ignoring their symptoms.

The others aren’t very friendly too, apart from one receptionist at Pultney St whom I haven’t seen recently.  I couldn’t believe the attitude of one receptionist when I popped over to request a GP call back (I was dropping off my children at the nearby school and was passing in front of the surgery). She asked me to telephone the surgery. I asked whether the reason she’s asking me to call is because Pultney Practice answers the calls; she said ‘not necessarily’. I pointed out that as i was passing by on my way home, it makes no difference if Bathampton answers the calls but she stuck with her script. It was absurd! I stepped out of the surgery, got my mobile out and called and got her colleague who sat right next to her answer the call, took my details and rudely said there was no chance of a GP calling me that day as they have a backlog so best to ring first thing the next day!

However, on yesterday's experience, I can honestly say I now feel much more condfident about needing to have an operation at QA.   Firstly, I didn't feel a thing when the cannula was put in - and I have had some very uncomfortable experiences of this in the past in another hospital, with staff who simply couldn't seem to find a vein, or appear to care less how uncomfortable it was, so I know it isn't always that easy. Then, when I felt a bit sick and dizzy after the scan I was offered tea and biscuits.  Also, the staff couldn't have been nicer and  made sure I was OK to go home before letting me leave.  I know this was only a very minor procedure, but having seen just how lovely the staff are, I now feel far less apprehensive about my next visit which will mean an operation, though this will obviously  be far more stressful and probably quite painful.  I have had several hospital stays in the past and know that it is the attitude of the staff that makes all the difference.  When I had a total hip replacement at another hospital last year it was the kindness and care of the vast majority of the staff that made the whole procedure, painful as it was, much easier to endure. Only the one nurse who filled me with dread every time saw her approach gave anything less that the care you would hope for.  I'm afraid she was a bully and completely without sympathy.  It is the attitude of the staff every time that even helps with the healing process I believe, so having met such kind and caring people yesterday in the CT department, even though very busy, gives one  hope that staff in other departments will be equally kind, and  helps one feel so much more confident about the hospital.  Thank you everyone in the CT department, if they are all like you I shall be fine.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-01-26T12:20:40","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-01-26T12:26:27","readBy":[{"name":"Portsmouth Hospitals NHS Trust","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/734039","id":"734039"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/734039/responses","id":"734039"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/734039/healthservices","id":"734039"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/734039/tags","id":"734039"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rhu03","id":"RHU03","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/apprehensive","id":"apprehensive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/afraid","id":"afraid"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ct","id":"ct"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dizzy","id":"dizzy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hip","id":"hip"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hip%20replacement","id":"hip replacement"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/operation","id":"operation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scan","id":"scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/uncomfortable","id":"uncomfortable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confident","id":"confident"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hope","id":"Hope"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/734188","id":"734188"}]}]
