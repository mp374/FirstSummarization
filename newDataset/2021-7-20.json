Although from admission the staff have been tremendous and they aren't praised enough. My injury is a broken ankle which I got through falling at home. Frustratingly I had a 4 hour wait on the ambulance service to get to me which meant I had to lie on the floor in extreme pain for such a long time. I think the undertstaffing of the ambulance service is outrageous and needs to be sorted. The 2 ambulance staff on where the only 2 ambulance crew covering my area that day and they were never off their feet. When they arrived they were so apologetic about my wait and I found it completely understandable as it's not them who are failing to provide the appropriate care, it's the system. They couldn't do enough for me and made me feel reassured and comfortable on my way to hospital. I am very happy with this service.  \r\nThey brought me into A&E where I had to wait a ridiculously long time to be seen. The place was packed and the lack of space made me frustrated, it was unbearable. When I eventually got an x-Ray the staff were so lovely, kind and helpful. I have currently been in a week and am waiting for my swelling to go down before I can get operated on which is a bit of a disaster but that's my body's fault.  \r\nAt the minute I am in a lot of pain but the staff are doing their best for me. To be honest some explanation may be lacking in terms of my treatment as I would like to know a bit more about exactly what's going on with my treatment and care as well as what the future may look like for me. Finally I am very glad to have a room on my own which is bright and airy and I enjoy looking out onto the greenery, spending so long lying up unable to move I do get very bored so I am glad I can see out.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-07-17T18:06:54.87","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-07-20T08:48:09.78","readBy":[{"name":"Northern Ireland ambulance service","count":5},{"name":"Southern Health and Social Care Trust","count":7},{"name":"Public Health Agency","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/863525","id":"863525"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/863525/responses","id":"863525"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/863525/healthservices","id":"863525"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/863525/tags","id":"863525"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/nias-emergency","id":"nias-emergency","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_32024_110","id":"ZT003_32024_110","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_32024_180","id":"ZT003_32024_180","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frustrated","id":"frustrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/shocked","id":"shocked"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/a&e%20waiting","id":"a&E waiting"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ambulance%20crew","id":"ambulance crew"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ankle","id":"ankle"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/broken","id":"broken"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/broken%20ankle","id":"broken ankle"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/feet","id":"feet"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/glad","id":"glad"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/injury","id":"injury"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wait%20to%20see%20doctor","id":"wait to see doctor"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/x-ray","id":"X-ray"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happy","id":"happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wait%20for%20ambulance","id":"wait for ambulance"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20happy","id":"not happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20home","id":"at home"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/864403","id":"864403"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/866385","id":"866385"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/867106","id":"867106"}]},{"id":863527,"author":"Treyj95","authorRoleId":8,"authorRole":"a staff member posting for a patient/service user","title":"My experience in the A&E department","body":"I have been in and out of the hospital for approximately 100 days and during this time I have felt the staff to be extremely attentive, diligent and kind. They work extremely hard and are failed at system level with the pressures and business they have to deal with. I am extremely content that I can ask any of the nurses on the ward a question and everything has been well communicated with me throughout my time in hospital. I really appreciate this as it can be daunting going through hospital unaware of what is going on in regards to your treatment. I am comfortable in my ward and feel I have sufficient privacy to get on with my reading. The only thing I could criticise with regards to my stay is the waiting time I experienced from my arrival in the A&E department to me getting a bed. I came in at 6pm and did not receive a bed until 3.30 am. It was a long wait which is frustrating however I understand there are sicker patients ahead of me and it is not the fault of the staff.

However, I have a phobia of lifts and climbed two flight of stairs to come up to this ward. When I arrived it was a cubicle and it was a four bed. I had asked the midwife who escorted me up if I can have the window side as its warm and it was only me and another patient in room. They said they would let them know and they will change it around. The bed in that cubicle was not made. I called the buzzer and asked the nurse as I had been waiting and in pain how long will it be so, I can move and settle there instead of geting all my belongings out here as I'm struggling and in pain. The staff member did not change the sheets for the bed and refused and said it can be 2-3 hours as they were busy, Bearing in mind this is a staff member who will be looking after me and my baby. I found them very rude and did not co-operate. To some it up, to me this is not a high care unit and I did not feel treated fairly and the found the staffare arrogant and did not help. My baby was not given meds on time and did not get them until I buzzed to ask why. The night staff that I came across were a disgrace. I've had a major surgery I'm in pain and they want me to keep making my baby feeds in the kitchen myself and if I asked them for help they would behave awkward and make faces. I felt so scared here and did not feel safe at all.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-07-17T07:20:35.7766667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-07-20T09:09:07.96","readBy":[{"name":"Bradford Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/863504","id":"863504"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/863504/responses","id":"863504"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/863504/healthservices","id":"863504"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/863504/tags","id":"863504"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rae02","id":"RAE02","score":1},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scared","id":"scared"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/worried","id":"worried"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/accessibility","id":"accessibility"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/accommodating","id":"accommodating"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breathing","id":"breathing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/c-section","id":"c-section"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/help","id":"help"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/maternity","id":"maternity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/night%20staff","id":"night staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/phobia","id":"phobia"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/section","id":"section"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attitude","id":"staff attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/the%20change","id":"the change"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication%20delay","id":"medication delay"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unsafe","id":"unsafe"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/864240","id":"864240"}]},{"id":863520,"author":"Keeen88","authorRoleId":8,"authorRole":"a staff member posting for a patient/service user","title":"Good care but some improvements needed","body":"I have come into hospital for an operation.

If there had been anything wrong with the baby I do not trust that it would have been handled well. I came away feeling like we might as well have gone to Premier Inn to have the baby as I basically was put in a room and left to it.  \r\nThis was my second baby and I had always planned to have an epidural for the birth - when I called ahead I told them this. As soon as I arrived at the hospital having contractions I told the midwives I'd like an epidural - they looked at each other blankly and then went off to a staff area whilst I stood there at reception having painful contractions.  \r\nEventually I was taken to a room, checked and told I was 3cm dilated. I really think this is unlikely as I was 3cm dilated 2 days earlier at my midwife check up and now I was heavily contracting!  \r\nAnyway that was it - me in this room in so much pain, with my husband, and I thinking I sure hope the anaesthetist gets here soon. My husband had to keep going out to find the midwife to ask her for any updates. She would come into the room and just say \"no sorry he’s busy in surgery\" and then just stand there watching me have a contraction silently and then leave.  \r\nShe never checked me again and I had to ring the emergency alarm when in all honesty I thought I was going to poo! I told her this when she came in and she stood there with her hand cupped under my anus whilst I bent over the bed in pain. At no point did she say, you’re actually having the baby now, let’s get you in position.  \r\nAnother midwife came in, who I'd never seen before, and it was her that said why don’t you get on the bed so we don’t drop the baby onto the floor and that was when I knew the baby was actually coming! (This was an hour after being told I was 3cm dilated and left then alone.)  \r\nI was not supported one bit - not informed about what was happening to me let alone given any ‘you’re doing really well’ or ‘it’s time to push when you feel the contractions’. I feel that I did it alone, with my poor husband helplessly watching the shock on my face.  \r\nAfter the birth I sat in a blood soaked gown on the blood soaked bed for two hours waiting to birth the placenta. I don’t know why I didn’t ask for the sheets to be changed but I was quite shell shocked by my experience.  \r\nWhen it came time for a shift changeover the new midwife came in and said oh dear let’s get you cleaned up and change these sheets. She was very lovely and I wish I’d had her for the birth.  \r\nI had a beautiful baby girl who was healthy and passed all the tests and we were ready to go home by 1pm. We didn’t make it out the door until 8pm because we were waiting on the results of a final blood test for me, which it transpired they lost the blood sample for and had to do again.  \r\nIf I have another baby, I would NEVER go to this hospital!","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-07-16T23:09:42.5633333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-07-20T09:20:00.21","readBy":[{"name":"Medway NHS Foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/863423","id":"863423"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/863423/responses","id":"863423"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/863423/healthservices","id":"863423"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/863423/tags","id":"863423"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rpa02_501","id":"RPA02_501","score":1},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lack%20of%20care","id":"Lack of care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/shocked","id":"shocked"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/alone","id":"alone"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/birth","id":"birth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/contractions","id":"contractions"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/epidural","id":"epidural"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/labour","id":"labour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lack%20of%20support","id":"lack of support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/midwives","id":"midwives"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/placenta","id":"placenta"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/864926","id":"864926"}]},{"id":863522,"author":"Treyj95","authorRoleId":8,"authorRole":"a staff member posting for a patient/service user","title":"Caring and helpful staff","body":"I have been in hospital for 4 weeks and have been extremely impressed with the staff.

I was disappointed with the standard of care as if I had been having a heart attack from the chest pain, I could have died before I had been seen to. I felt I was going around in circles in the A&E department and was moved between corridors and wards whilst still not having any contact with medical staff. The only staff I encountered were administrative staff which I found shocking, given the symptoms I came in with. I do however recognise that this is a problem not at hospital level but at system level and the individual members of the medical team working were superb. On one occasion I had requested more pain relief and was told that this was not possible as I had missed it. I questioned this and felt frustrated as I could not have possibly missed my dose of medication considering I had been lying in the same bed all day. I was disappointed with the miscommunication between staff which meant I was not given the medication I feel I should have been given.  \r\nThey provided fantastic care as soon as I made it to the cardiology ward. The nurses and doctors were attentive and kind. They are all extremely hard working and I would like to emphasise that failures of the service are as a result of problems at the system level compared to individual staff members. The care provided was efficient and has meant I have been able to return home sooner.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-07-17T18:48:58.3","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-07-20T10:19:16.913","readBy":[{"name":"Southern Health and Social Care Trust","count":9},{"name":"Public Health Agency","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/863531","id":"863531"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/863531/responses","id":"863531"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/863531/healthservices","id":"863531"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/863531/tags","id":"863531"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_32024_180","id":"ZT003_32024_180","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_32024_320","id":"ZT003_32024_320","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disappointed","id":"disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frustrated","id":"frustrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cardiology","id":"cardiology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/chest","id":"chest"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/chest%20pain","id":"chest pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/heart","id":"heart"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/heart%20attack","id":"heart attack"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kind%20staff","id":"kind staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain%20relief","id":"pain relief"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/understaffed","id":"understaffed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting%20times","id":"waiting times"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fantastic","id":"fantastic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/relieved","id":"relieved"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication%20delay","id":"medication delay"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/866367","id":"866367"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/867109","id":"867109"}]},{"id":863533,"author":"Keeen88","authorRoleId":8,"authorRole":"a staff member posting for a patient/service user","title":"There was little to no water offered to me","body":"I originally came into A& E yesterday but it was so extremely busy.

I felt distant from the healthcare community, as fortunately I or a family member, have never experienced any major health problems.  \r\nThis all changed however in June 2021. My 86 year old grandmother, who has dementia, was admitted to hospital with blood poisoning. The care she received from a staff member named Frankie, was nothing short of exceptional. She started every day with a smile as Frankie would regale her every morning with the famous ‘Glasgow patter’ over a cup of tea.  \r\nHe took time and effort to discuss my mother’s memories of growing up in the Highlands, and by the end of it, my mother was laughing every day. The time he took to speak to my mother will be appreciated forever. Myself and my two brothers, will always discuss the positive impact he had on her.  \r\nI just want to thank Frankie for how he treated my grandmother and I now have even more admiration for NHS staff. Thank you Frankie, and thank you all at Kirkcaldy Hospital for being such inspirational figures.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-07-17T19:39:01.46","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2021-07-20T10:40:14.99","readBy":[{"name":"Office of Annabelle Ewing, MSP for Cowdenbeath","count":1},{"name":"Fife Health & Social Care Partnership","count":2},{"name":"NHS Fife","count":5}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/863539","id":"863539"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/863539/responses","id":"863539"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/863539/healthservices","id":"863539"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/863539/tags","id":"863539"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/f704h-medicine-of-the-elderly","id":"f704h-medicine-of-the-elderly","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazed","id":"amazed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood","id":"blood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20poisoning","id":"blood poisoning"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dementia","id":"dementia"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/excellent","id":"excellent"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/inspired","id":"inspired"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/positive","id":"positive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appreciated","id":"appreciated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassion","id":"compassion"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/admiration","id":"admiration"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid","id":"covid"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%2019","id":"covid 19"}]},{"id":863512,"author":"Lou231","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Care in paediatric ward","body":"My baby was admitted to the paediatric ward at 3 months old following an episode where I was worried about her breathing.  \r\nShe was born at 35 weeks and I had been exclusively breastfeeding her. Her weight gain had been slow but before I went into the hospital no one had raised any concerns with her weight or feeding. Once In the ward the staff made inappropriate comments about my baby's weight, referring to her as scrawny. As a new mum I found this really distressing and a really unkind way to describe my baby. I was advised that I would get breastfeeding support from the infant feeding team but they never came and the breast pump for expressing which was advised by the drs never arrived either  \r\nI felt like I was being pressured to bottle feed my baby despite wishing to breastfeed. I felt like what I was not doing enough for my baby and I didn’t receive any support to continue feeding whilst I was an inpatient. It felt like some of the staff really didn’t have the right knowledge and understanding of breastfeeding. I really wanted to breastfeed her and following my discharge home when all tests had shown no concerns the support I got from breastfeeding support in the community was amazing. However my confidence had already been knocked.  \r\nI had a second admission where again her weight was constantly seen as the focus of our admission when it was her breathing I was concerned about.  \r\nAgain I felt undermined and pressured into bottle feeding. I was told if she didn’t put on a certain amount of weight in a few days then I would be admitted to the ward for a week! Still I saw no one in the ward to support me with a feeding plan that involved breast feeding. She was weighed daily and the stress this caused me was huge.  \r\nCare plans were changed and one dr told me I could go home and another said I had to stay.  \r\nOverall both stays I had in the ward were stressful and emotional. A number of the staff in the ward were lovely and caring however the negative experiences I had really affected my overall experience.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-07-17T15:15:28.4166667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-07-20T10:41:06.217","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Fife","count":7},{"name":"Fife Health & Social Care Partnership","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/863512","id":"863512"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/863512/responses","id":"863512"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/863512/healthservices","id":"863512"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/863512/tags","id":"863512"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/f704h_420","id":"F704H_420","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stress","id":"stress"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/worried","id":"worried"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breast%20feeding","id":"breast feeding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breathing","id":"breathing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care%20plans","id":"care plans"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/concerned","id":"concerned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/knowledge","id":"knowledge"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/paediatric","id":"paediatric"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pressured","id":"pressured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/some%20staff","id":"some staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/understanding","id":"understanding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breast%20feeding%20support","id":"breast feeding support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/undermined","id":"undermined"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/no%20confidence","id":"no confidence"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/inconsistent%20information","id":"inconsistent information"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/community%20breastfeeding%20support","id":"community breastfeeding support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/language%20used","id":"language used"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/864160","id":"864160"}]},{"id":863535,"author":"Treyj95","authorRoleId":8,"authorRole":"a staff member posting for a patient/service user","title":"I am grateful to all the staff","body":"I came to Craigavon Area Hospital at 4 pm and did not get a bed until 7 pm.

I feel comfortable asking them questions.  \r\nI could not fault anyone or anything so far.  \r\nThank you to everyone that has helped me.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-07-18T15:04:54.3133333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-07-20T11:38:50.603","readBy":[{"name":"Northern Ireland ambulance service","count":4},{"name":"Southern Health and Social Care Trust","count":6}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/863617","id":"863617"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/863617/responses","id":"863617"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/863617/healthservices","id":"863617"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/863617/tags","id":"863617"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/nias-emergency","id":"nias-emergency","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_32024-3-south-surgical","id":"ZT003_32024-3-south-surgical","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/brain%20tumour","id":"brain tumour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctors","id":"doctors"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gynaecology","id":"gynaecology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kept%20informed","id":"kept informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/looked%20after","id":"looked after"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/paramedics","id":"paramedics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassurance","id":"reassurance"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/safe","id":"safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/warm","id":"warm"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20ease","id":"at ease"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/moved%20around","id":"moved around"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/questions%20answered","id":"questions answered"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/864413","id":"864413"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/877588","id":"877588"}]},{"id":863616,"author":"Rhiyj26","authorRoleId":8,"authorRole":"a staff member posting for a patient/service user","title":"The staff have been amazing","body":"The staff in 2 West Maternity, Craigavon have been amazing, so good and I've been looked after so well.

We as parents had noticed a few years ago that she displayed certain traits that raised concerns and after researching concluded that she exhibited clear defined signs of Asperger's Syndrome / ASD.  \r\nWe were referred by our local GP in 2019 and received an initial appointment a few months later with a nurse as part of the assessment phase, we were advised that she agreed that our daughter fitted the profile of potentially being on the spectrum and we would now be put on the waiting list for diagnosis.  \r\nDuring the first lockdown my daughter suffered increased anxiety, being an only child she was isolated and it was extremely hard for her. Her autism, entwined with anxiety increased in symptoms.  \r\nThis severely affected my daughter's mental health and set her way back in comparison to her peers and school. Despite repeated requests, we feel there was no school work or effort made by the school due to my daughter not having an official diagnoses and we as parents were treated as overly concerned parents as they said she was fine in school, despite us explaining she was masking.  \r\nShe transitioned into primary six in August and managed 1-3 days a week of school, due to anxiety, separation anxiety and stress leading to poor sleep and health, depression and school refusal. Still we received no help from the school or CAMHS.  \r\nSecond lock down in January and schools closed again, winter, children not going outside created the perfect storm for her, her anxiety increased her stress and worries all increased with COVID and lock down put her mental health in a spiralling downward slope. She was having multiple panic attacks daily, refusing to wash, barely eating, her sensory issues were off the scales, her nightmares and inability to sleep increased. She says she just wants to die, that she’s sad and doesn’t know why. She is depressed. At ten year old she wanted to kill herself. She has run out of the house, a moving car down the street or when stressed hits her head against a wall repeatedly.  \r\nThe only thing we could do was remove her from school all together (removing the main stressor) for her mental well-being and at a waiting time of 95 weeks for diagnoses within CAMHS we begged and borrowed the money to have her assessed privately (£1500 for a family on benefits at that point).  \r\nThis helped with school as they were harassing us and not willing to understand that she was suffering – why, because until then we were still waiting for the NHS to help us.  \r\nThrough her sessions with a private therapist it has come to light that she has profiles of PDA and ADHD as well as the ASD she was originally diagnosed with. She will rarely leave the house, has full blown panic attacks where she cannot breathe, will not be in a room alone the whole family have now been sleeping in the same room for months (we are still waiting for a sleep referral made over 70 weeks ago). She continues to be terrified of any flying animal (except birds) so barely manages to get out with the dogs, and if she does I end up carrying her or she clings to me. She forces herself out of the house with me because cannot bear to be apart from me at all, for any length of time.. If she needs the toilet, I must go with her. She pulls her hair out in clumps at the smallest worry. Any illness she hears about sends her into a panic. Socialising is exhausting, even seeing her cousins fills her with anxiety that is paralysing. Her sensitivity to paper has increased, this includes paper straws, toilet paper (we make washable toilet cloths). She is scared of us leaving her. She barely washes, brushes her teeth or trims her nails. She is easily distracted, needs to move constantly and… her world is shrinking daily, she is lonely and feels she is not understood.  \r\nHer father and I do all we can, read, joined parent groups but do not possess the specialist skills needed to help her. We are both on anti-depressants. Her father has attempted suicide. Our family is being torn apart. Following a complaint we made we had a call from an occupational therapist 5 weeks ago, who tried to tell me that they didn’t think CAMHS was a suitable fit for her at the moment, that we should see an OT, that they would chase the sleep referral and also refer us to the Strathclyde Autistic Society. Also if I sent in the private diagnoses report that she would verify it. I pushed for her to see CAMHS. She needs to see a psychotherapist and potentially have therapy with medication. We have heard nothing since.  \r\nWith the NHS failing to see my daughter, she has missed essentially a whole year of school, has become increasingly isolated and has anxiety issues that are heart breaking to watch.  \r\nWe have been put into debt to pay for private treatment , I had to stop being my husband and daughters carer and forced back to full time work which has put a tremendous strain on our family, as my husband is disabled retired.  \r\nWe would like to see my daughter grow up to be the vibrant happy person she used to be, not another statistic of those we lose, and we do lose them, without appropriate help, all too often girls lose their lives through chronic depression, eating disorders, miss-understood melt-downs.  \r\nWe know early intervention is key to a happy long life. Our daughter needs professional help and she needs it now, as she develops her sense of self, before her world shrinks further and her autism, anxiety and depression impact her further and for longer.","criticality":"strongly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-07-10T15:57:23.62","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-07-20T12:56:31.713","readBy":[{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2021)","count":2},{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":11},{"name":"Scottish Government","count":1},{"name":"St. Andrews University ScotGEM Medical Students","count":1},{"name":"Sheffield University Medical School 2021","count":1},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":1},{"name":"Time to Change - Wales","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/861730","id":"861730"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/861730/responses","id":"861730"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/861730/healthservices","id":"861730"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/861730/tags","id":"861730"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sj9-camhs","id":"sj9-CAMHS","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/angry","id":"angry"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hopeless","id":"Hopeless"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/isolated","id":"isolated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sad","id":"sad"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scared","id":"scared"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stress","id":"stress"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stressed","id":"stressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/terrified","id":"terrified"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/worried","id":"worried"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/access","id":"access"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/adhd","id":"adhd"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/alone","id":"alone"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/asd","id":"ASD"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/autism","id":"autism"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/camhs","id":"camhs"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/depression","id":"depression"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diagnoses","id":"Diagnoses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diagnosis","id":"diagnosis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disabled","id":"disabled"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/early%20intervention","id":"Early Intervention"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/failure","id":"failure"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/panic","id":"panic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/suicide","id":"suicide"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/teeth","id":"teeth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/time","id":"time"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20concerned","id":"very concerned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting%20times","id":"waiting times"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fine","id":"fine"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20happy","id":"not happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pushed%20out","id":"pushed out"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/864242","id":"864242"}]},{"id":863615,"author":"Rhiyj26","authorRoleId":8,"authorRole":"a staff member posting for a patient/service user","title":"Experience in MLU","body":"My experience in the Midwifery Led Unit in Craigavon Area Hospital has been overall positive.

On the day she made me feel relaxed despite being in my local A+E at the Victoria Hospital for the clinic. I had to be observed for 30min and in this time the nurse and nursing assistant made me feel comfortable. I was then contacted a few days after to see how I had been and then a few days after that to let me know the specialist panels decision on where I should get my second vaccination. I have just received my second vaccination today (17th July) in a community setting however I had to phone for an appointment and was told I must have gotten lost in the system due to going from one pathway to another. The nurses and the nursing assistants today at Carnegie Campus were second to none and made me feel at ease. Despite a few hiccups along the way in receiving my vaccination I would like to commend the high-risk clinic at the Victoria Hospital Kirkcaldy and all the staff at the Carnegie Campus for the work they are doing.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-07-17T17:34:32.8033333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-07-20T13:19:33.19","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Fife","count":7},{"name":"NHS National Services Scotland","count":1},{"name":"Fife Health & Social Care Partnership","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/863519","id":"863519"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/863519/responses","id":"863519"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/863519/healthservices","id":"863519"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/863519/tags","id":"863519"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/f704h_180","id":"F704H_180","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sf9-covidvacs","id":"Sf9-covidvacs","score":4},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frustrating","id":"frustrating"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication%20beforehand","id":"communication beforehand"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication%20between%20services","id":"communication between services"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/correspondence","id":"correspondence"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/understanding","id":"understanding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vaccination","id":"vaccination"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/feel%20at%20ease","id":"feel at ease"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/relaxed","id":"relaxed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/patient%20information%20on%20treatment","id":"Patient information on treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20ease","id":"at ease"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/understanding%20of%20patient's%20fears","id":"understanding of patient's fears"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid","id":"covid"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%2019","id":"covid 19"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/865618","id":"865618"}]},{"id":863623,"author":"Rhiyj26","authorRoleId":8,"authorRole":"a staff member posting for a patient/service user","title":"Really high standards","body":"My experience in 1 North Craigavon Area Hospital has been really quite lovely.

I originally did not think it was that serious, however I later got worse and phoned for an ambulance.  \r\nThe waiting times for an ambulance were far too long - 220 minutes for an ambulance to Craigavon and 62 minutes for an ambulance to Daisy Hill Hospital. This was too long a wait for me so I was driven up to the hospital by a family member.  \r\nIn A&E I only had to stay in the waiting room for 20 minutes, which I found to be very efficient. I was then quickly given a scan where a clot was found in my chest. I found the whole emergency department to be very quick and responsive - with my bloods done and results back within an hour. The doctor treating me was very kind and explained everything to me that I needed to know.  \r\nUp on the Female Surgical Ward the staff have also been brilliant. The doctors and nurses have all been lovely as well as accommodating towards me. I especially like how all the nurses, even those not directly responsible for my care, would pop their heads in to introduce themselves. I find it reassuring knowing the names and faces of all those taking care of me. The staff have always made me feel very comfortable and are always there if I need anything at all.  \r\nI only have two minor areas which I think would make an improvement to my overall hospital visit. Firstly, I feel there should be more vending machines closer to the wards, as it can be a very long trip down to the ground floor shop - especially if you're only after surgery. Secondly, I have noticed a lot of noise/family members coming in at night. It would be nicer if the doors could be closed just to give a bit more peace and quiet as well as a bit of privacy.  \r\nOverall, I am happy enough with my hospital stay here at Daisy Hill Hospital.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-07-18T18:34:05.6133333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-07-20T14:22:49.903","readBy":[{"name":"Northern Ireland ambulance service","count":5},{"name":"Southern Health and Social Care Trust","count":3}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/863642","id":"863642"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/863642/responses","id":"863642"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/863642/healthservices","id":"863642"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/863642/tags","id":"863642"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/nias-emergency","id":"nias-emergency","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_33020_180","id":"ZT003_33020_180","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_33020_502","id":"ZT003_33020_502","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/accommodating","id":"accommodating"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20clot","id":"blood clot"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20tests","id":"blood tests"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctors","id":"doctors"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency","id":"emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fall","id":"fall"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/noise%20at%20night","id":"noise at night"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/responsive","id":"responsive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scan","id":"scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happy","id":"happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassuring","id":"reassuring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wait%20for%20ambulance","id":"wait for ambulance"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/comfortable","id":"comfortable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/more%20vending%20machines","id":"more vending machines"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/864395","id":"864395"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/866428","id":"866428"}]},{"id":863643,"author":"whisperrr45","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"No complaints about A&E","body":"I was taken to the Emergency Department at Daisy Hill Hospital today and my overall experience has been quite good -I honestly have no complaints.

So that means every time I have to walk there and pass them the letters they should receive weeks ago. Then I will have to wait 1-2 weeks to get an appointment and ask the doctor to prescribe me my scheduled check ups. The doctor will prescribed me the wrong blood check which means another 2 week delay till I find that out. Then I have to pick up again the blood form and book a new blood test .Then for some reason the lab fails to produce the right blood test which means have to book another appointment with the doctor ask for a new blood test and so on. So far I have gave blood 2 times and still they don't produce the right test. The doctor has admitted that there is a problem there and he said will try to find out why this keeps happening and will let me know. 1 week already passed and I have no idea what is going on. Again I have to through the procedure. Ofcourse I will not get any notification if the doctor had prescribed me a new blood test. Either I have to guess it or book and appointment in the next 2 weeks. \nI am already stressed about my health and they make me even worst. I am so tired of the idea  I have to ask for 10 appointments to schedule a check up that should be scheduled already. Nobody can do anything about not receiving any updates from other hospitals. I have checked my details from both sides and are correct. The doctors will not contact you or you will not get any notification that your blood form should be picked up , you have to spend hours on the line to book an appointment .

Why can’t I ask for an appointment or call back with a doctor without the unnecessary business of listing all of my symptoms to a receptionist. General Practitioner means just that, I shouldn’t have to refer myself to a specialist via the online system (or with a call handler that sighs and gives the distinct impression they don’t want to be there). If you do get spoken to by a doctor quite quickly, then good for you, but don’t undermine other people’s legitimate complaints because this has happened to me every time I have tried to use the service and it seems that it has happened to a lot more people as well!!","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2021-07-20T07:37:08","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-07-20T15:07:28","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/864254","id":"864254"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/864254/responses","id":"864254"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/864254/healthservices","id":"864254"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/864254/tags","id":"864254"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/b82005","id":"B82005","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appalling","id":"appalling"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20upset","id":"very upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/excellent","id":"excellent"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good","id":"good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nose","id":"nose"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20good","id":"not good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/865031","id":"865031"}]},{"id":864252,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Great Service","body":"Easy to book, friendly and pleasant reception.
