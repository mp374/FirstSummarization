This is an elderly couple who are struggling through, trying to get the care they need.  \r\nI've tried to phone the number given on the letter, but it just goes to answer phone. They could give just a courtesy telephone call, just to say they would be late, or explain that they were sick again and couldn't make it today.  \r\nMy father has been continuously deteriorating, and this is just so long without any contact or care.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-09-08T12:55:21.66","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2021-09-10T08:43:21.917","readBy":[{"name":"Somerset NHS Foundation Trust","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/876299","id":"876299"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/876299/responses","id":"876299"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/876299/healthservices","id":"876299"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/876299/tags","id":"876299"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rh5g1","id":"RH5G1","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cancelled%20appointments","id":"cancelled appointments"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/elderly","id":"elderly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kept%20informed","id":"kept informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sickness","id":"sickness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/parkinson's","id":"parkinson's"}]},{"id":876410,"author":"AbandonedbytheNHS","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Uninformed and dismissive","body":"Having been refused a face to face appointment with a GP I requested a copy of my health records to allow me take ownership of my own health care.

The younger doctor I saw was also super friendly and had great bedside manner.  \r\nI wanted to pass on a couple of observations though about the environment, travelling between orthopaedics outpatients and the xray department in a wheelchair several times over the course of my treatment.  \r\nFirstly, the porters had to climb past me to push buttons to open the various doors we went through, stopping, starting and apologising each time. This seems really silly in such a new build. I would like to see either supermarket style automatic doors or the buttons in a place suitable for the porters to hit them.  \r\nSecondly, the doors are only barely wide enough for the wheelchairs to go through and while I was in the xray department, I saw doors propped open with a bottle of solution, folded bits of card and in one case a box. The staff don't to this to deliberately break fire regulations, but to cope with an unsuitable environment. So I would like the whole doorway situation to be looked at.  \r\nFinally, the porters cannot see oncoming traffic down the corridor as they leave the bays pushing people. Again, they have to stop, start, lean past you, apologise. I think it could all be so much smoother if you just installed a couple of parabolic mirrors.  \r\nThanks for listening, I'm very grateful to all the staff who were there for me when I really need them.","criticality":"minimally critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-09-09T08:52:39.5633333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-09-10T08:53:47.6","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Dumfries and Galloway","count":10}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/876461","id":"876461"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/876461/responses","id":"876461"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/876461/healthservices","id":"876461"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/876461/tags","id":"876461"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/y104h-orthopaedics","id":"y104h-orthopaedics","score":5},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/y104h-radiography","id":"y104h-radiography","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctor","id":"doctor"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doors","id":"doors"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/environment","id":"environment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly%20staff","id":"friendly staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/junior%20doctor","id":"Junior Doctor"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/orthopaedics","id":"orthopaedics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/porter","id":"porter"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/porters","id":"porters"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/suggestions","id":"suggestions"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thoughtful","id":"thoughtful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wheelchair","id":"wheelchair"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/xray","id":"Xray"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/satisfied","id":"satisfied"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/876798","id":"876798"}]},{"id":876464,"author":"authenticxr66","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"I think you're just marvelous","body":"The Cardiac nurses at Bideford Hospital gave me a leaflet asking what I thought of the service, and here it is: I think you are just marvelous.  \r\nThe care I have is lovely and inspiring.

I had a long stay on the ward. I was unable to have many visits from my family, however all members of staff were easy to speak to and genuinely cared about what was going on in my life outside the hospital. The ward is a busy ward with lots of patients to look after but the staff will always make time for you, even senior nurses like the charge nurse. When it came to being discharged, many members of staff made the time to pop in to say bye to me after I had spent so much time on the ward!  \r\nThe domestic staff (green tunic) will serve teas and coffee and clean the bathrooms, and health care assistants (light blue tunic) will answer any buzzers, make beds & get you washed, and pass messages on to the nurses. Nurses (blue tunic) will do medicine rounds, wound dressings, putting up fluids etc  \r\nBeing tube fed, I was under the care of the surgical team, parenteral nutrition team, nutrition nurses and dietitian alongside regular 104 staff and gastroenterologists.  \r\nI will say that I was waiting on a surgical procedure which was due to be preformed on a Wednesday. However, there was miscommunication from the surgical team to the doctors and nursing staff about a delay, so we didn’t hear all day that the procedure actually wasn’t happening. Though this was quickly rectified and subsequently I was taken in on the emergency surgical list the next day.  \r\nI was extremely happy with this result. I would like to say that the hospitals are really trying to balance covid care and other emergency & routine care, which has resulted in a lot of pressure on the services offered, the stress of it all is clear when speaking to staff trying to find beds or when trying to organise a more serious procedure like a surgical one, this resulted in a couple of weeks delay initially while we experienced quite a few complications that could otherwise be surgically solved in a world without the current pressures experienced at the moment. However this isn’t reflective on the staff on the ward at all and alternative treatments were attempted while we were waiting for the surgical team to intervene.  \r\nAfter my surgery, there were slight complications and I required slightly more care than usual, despite usually being independent, the staff were more than happy to offer help with washing which was much appreciated.  \r\nWhen considering covid, I felt very safe for most of my time on ward 104, given that the ward is mostly side rooms. Towards the end of my stay I was moved into the four bedded bay, but there is frequent testing for new patients. The ward is constantly being cleaned and your bed space is always being wiped down by the healthcare assistants and domestic staff before teas and mealtimes.  \r\nI felt listened to and that all staff involved in my care were knowledgeable about my condition. This was important to me as I’ve had poor experiences before where medical staff at another hospital did know much about my condition. I also felt that students were willing to learn and that nurses were willing to teach students new things. I also felt as though I had a say in my treatment & discharge, particularly when it came to managing my nutrition. This was very important to me.  \r\nDischarge was fast and the discharge lounge was comfortable. I would also like to reassure any patients from the northern isles that the discharge nurse Judith is kind and compassionate, and will go above and beyond to ensure you are comfortable during your hospital stay, I would like to extend my thanks to her for all her help over my stay which was much appreciated by both me and my family.  \r\noverall although a stay in hospital is never pleasant, I believe the ward 104 staff work hard to make it as comfortable as possible for you to recover as well as you can.  \r\nOf all the staff who deserve a million thanks in the world, I would like to extend my thanks to dietitian Yvonne, and also to HCA Karen, who took me down to surgery, as well as washed my hair in the week after it. I was especially anxious for the surgery after a few bad experiences and she was really lovely to talk to even if she didn’t realise it!  \r\nThank you again ward 104 for all your help and for looking after me for all this time!","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-09-09T09:51:01.25","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-09-10T10:22:48.3","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Grampian","count":5}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/876468","id":"876468"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/876468/responses","id":"876468"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/876468/healthservices","id":"876468"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/876468/tags","id":"876468"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/n101h_301","id":"N101H_301","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cleanliness","id":"cleanliness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/discharge%20process","id":"Discharge process"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/domestic%20staff","id":"domestic staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fantastic%20service","id":"fantastic service"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gastroparesis","id":"Gastroparesis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nursing%20staff","id":"nursing staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/patient-centred","id":"patient-centred"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/respected","id":"respected"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/safe","id":"safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/students","id":"students"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/well%20looked%20after","id":"well looked after"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dignity","id":"Dignity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/crohn's%20disease","id":"crohn's disease"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/listened%20to","id":"listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/discharge%20nurse","id":"discharge nurse"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nutritionalist","id":"nutritionalist"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/877020","id":"877020"}]},{"id":872244,"author":"Charles112","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Repulsed by services in NHS","body":"Mental health services will not help, they write down what I say and send it to me, like a blog that somebody else wrote.

She was then very curt and not interested that the actions as stated by themselves on Monday had not been completed. I requested a call back from the practice manager but simply got a call back from another administrator who again failed to see the issue and blamed me for the fact they haven't registered by vaccine \"because you didnt complete a form\".

Why cant people accept responsibility for their failures, apologise and act to rectify it rather than blaming everyone else.

As a nurse, I find a reliance on 111 and walk in centres unacceptable but this really is what one has to do in absence of service from Marlborough surgery. My review is genuine and so many other Marlborough residents are becoming frustrated by the lack of service in the area. If you are eligible to register elsewhere, do so. If you experience poor service, contact CQC or the CCG - only by confronting this will things improve. Your complaint will help others and it is a serious situation.

I am confident that you are committed to, & successfully providing the best of what the NHS offers, for which I am truly grateful.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2021-09-09T18:13:26","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-09-10T13:58:16","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/876832","id":"876832"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/876832/responses","id":"876832"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/876832/healthservices","id":"876832"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/876832/tags","id":"876832"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l81084","id":"L81084","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20listened%20to","id":"not listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood","id":"blood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20test","id":"blood test"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care%20plan","id":"care plan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good","id":"good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20good","id":"not good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/test","id":"test"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confident","id":"confident"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20ease","id":"at ease"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1019557","id":"1019557"}]},{"id":876811,"author":"Ty's mum","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Alcohol and me","body":"A few years ago, I came to the realisation that I had a drinking problem. At first it was a non issue, but things soon got out of control. I spoke to my GP who then referred me to One Recovery Bucks. Initially, I didn't think I need to go to such extreme. I was ashamed, I also felt like I wasn't the type of person who would need that kind of help. But I let go of my pride and booked an appointment. Even when I attended the induction, the shame overwhelmed me. I was assigned to a wonderful lady called Helen and she made me feel at ease straight away. She was non judgemental and I felt safe to really express my struggles. It was difficult at first to follow the plan she made for me, but her support motivated me.  \r\nI was doing so well that they passed me over to another keyworker called Rob, who has been such a big part in my recovery journey. He has been such a huge support and i am forever grateful for his help.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-09-10T12:32:58.2433333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-09-10T13:58:55.057","readBy":[{"name":"Midlands Partnership NHS Foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/876811","id":"876811"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/876811/responses","id":"876811"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/876811/healthservices","id":"876811"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/876811/tags","id":"876811"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rrex4-buckinghamshire-stars","id":"RREX4-buckinghamshire-stars","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/alcohol","id":"alcohol"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/drinking%20problem","id":"drinking problem"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/non%20judgemental","id":"non judgemental"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happy","id":"happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported","id":"supported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/keyworkers","id":"keyworkers"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/877576","id":"877576"}]},{"id":876838,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Very efficient ","body":"Friendly and professional staff who took care and attention when dealing with the problem. \nFast, efficient and the minimum of fuss.
