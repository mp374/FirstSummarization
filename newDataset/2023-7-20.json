Baby seemed hungry as was unsettled a lot too, so wasn't getting what they needed from me.  \r\nA tongue tie was noticed by midwife when baby was just 4 days old. I had a visit from infant feeding team the next day and so midwife said they would be able to help. At this visit baby had lost 6% of birth weight. The feeding team said they could do nothing for a tongue tie unless referred. They helped with position but this was not solving the real issue.  \r\nMidwife then referred for tongue tie when baby was over a week old. Infant feeding spoke with me the next day to explain there had to be a further 3 visits from feeding team before we would be invited to clinic for tongue tie assessment. My baby had since lost even more weight, almost a whole pound under birth weight. I was also in a lot of pain after 2 bouts of mastitis and exhausted from next to no sleep due to baby not settling at all.  \r\nThe news that we had to wait even more time began to impact my mental health as I was worried my baby would continue to lose weight and I was feeling so unwell. It was recommended I top up with formula and express, this became even more of a burden on top of an already stressful feeding experience.  \r\nAfter 2 weeks breastfeeding, I gave up and switched baby to formula. We have since had tongue tie divided privately and feeding is now improved with baby gaining weight and content. I am very lucky I was able to take baby to be seen privately, not everyone can. I also believe that I could have continued to breastfeed had the tongue tie been taken more seriously and dealt with quickly. It is likely a lot of women give up breastfeeding prematurely as a result of this.  \r\nI feel that more training is required in this area so more staff are able to adequately diagnose tongue tie and perform the division procedure. It would help a lot of women and babies in their feeding journeys and reduce unnecessary stress at what should be a joyous time.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-07-13T18:36:54.2166667","progress":"Change planned","dateOfPublication":"2023-07-20T07:20:16.827","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lanarkshire","count":5},{"name":"Scottish Government","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1091462","id":"1091462"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1091462/responses","id":"1091462"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1091462/healthservices","id":"1091462"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1091462/tags","id":"1091462"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sl9-community-service-breastfeeding","id":"sl9-community-service-breastfeeding","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disappointed","id":"disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sad","id":"sad"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stressed","id":"stressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disheartened","id":"disheartened"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/exhausted","id":"exhausted"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mastitis","id":"mastitis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/process","id":"process"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/referral","id":"referral"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/training","id":"training"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting%20time","id":"waiting time"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tongue%20tie%20division","id":"tongue tie division"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1094773","id":"1094773"}]},{"id":1094289,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Prescription review","body":"The pharmacist was detailed in her questioning and supportive with follow up questions.

This was all my experience with Barnet North Core team, it has made me more unwell and stressed. It's a shame mental health care is a postcode lottery, and if you live in Barnet, you've lost.\r\n\r\n","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2023-07-19T13:16:14","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2023-07-20T07:22:15","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1094283","id":"1094283"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1094283/responses","id":"1094283"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1094283/healthservices","id":"1094283"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1094283/tags","id":"1094283"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rrp","id":"RRP","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ignored","id":"ignored"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stressed","id":"stressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/in%20control","id":"in control"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20good","id":"not good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/out%20of%20control","id":"out of control"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lost","id":"lost"}]},{"id":1094287,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Can I get my prescription?","body":"Prescriptions are not for fun.

I was Nil by Mouth for just over 2 days. During this time I had no IV fluids to keep me hydrated. Another patients faeces was left in a bed pan in the shared bathroom uncovered for over 12 hours. After multiple patients asked for this to be moved by nursing and HCA staff members, this was finally disposed of by another patient who got sick of the smell and having to see this when going to the toilet.  \r\nI was then moved to another ward. I wasn't told I was allowed to eat and drink but was then chastised by staff for 'refusing' when I wasn't told I could now eat and drink as normal. Another elderly patient in the bay who clearly was confused and delirious was shouting all night, screaming for help and nurses but was ignored. At one point mulitple patients buzzed for the nurse as the elderly patient's call button was moved out of their reach to advise that the patient had soiled herself. She was left wet and soiled for 2 hours.  \r\nNone of the patients got any sleep during the stay as we were told to get up in the morning and move around we couldn't sleep all day as that wouldn't help us get better. After being told I needed a catheter the nurse tried multiple times to insert this and after not being able to do so told me I could try do this myself or go without. When I said I had had multiple catheters before and had no issues having them put in I was told my genitalia wasn't normal and didn't look like others they had put catheters in before which is why they couldn't do it, which I found wholly unacceptable. I sat and cried after that feeling ashamed and embarrassed. This particular nurse upset another patient with a similar comment resulting in her removing her own IV and attempting to leave in the early hours of the morning.  \r\nMy symptoms and pain was not listened to. I was made to feel small and like an inconvenience. When being taken for a scan a HCA sat scrolling social media on her phone whilst we waited, texted friends and speaking about weekend plans. I'm not sure if they thought this was acceptable due to us being a similar age but it was not what I wanted to hear at 2:00am having been woken up and taken for a scan.  \r\nThe whole experience was terrible from start to finish. After being discharged I queried my medications as there were some the Dr told me I would need to take not included in the prescription. After much argument this was resolved but shouldn't have been such an argument to get medication which was on my discharge paperwork. I offered to go to the pharmacy myself to collect this but was told no.  \r\nI didn't not feel well enough to come home on discharge. I was still in significant pain, vomiting and unwell but made the decision that being at home and able to sleep, shower and eat properly would be better for myself than being in the hospital. The ward was dirty, staff didn't have name badges on, nurses would openly talk about and slag off patients within ear shot of the patients they were talking about to other staff and even other patients. Something needs to change - if the nurses don't want to be there and actually care about their patients mental and physical wellbeing then I think they should consider another career path.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-07-18T15:21:58.5033333","progress":"Story has a

They didn't know my Aunty, as they got her name muddled with someone else's. They said she was settling in well, but she's probably been there 2 decades. They worked downstairs, not upstairs, so they didn't know her. They went away to find someone who would know. After some time they said the nurse on the dementia ward was doing all the medication  I said that when I saw Aunty at her grandchilds wedding, many years ago, she was in a wheelchair and was taken back to Birch Green after the Church ceremony and did not stay for the family reception.  I observed, at that time, that Aunty appeared to have facial features and movements consistent with being medicated with neuroleptic antipsychotics. The care assistant wasn't able to comment on a resident's  medication.  I asked them to pop by and give Aunty a cup of tea from Valerie. I do care and I'm sorry that I have neglected Aunty. She was originally diagnosed with lupus and encouraged to go into the care home by medics and her husband. I'm pleased to have been given the name of the manager and best times to call tomorrow.  Maybe soon I will be able to visit the member of my family I loved being with most on family days out. She was very knd to me, as a small child and a lot of fun.

I expected long waiting times, but did not expect what felt to me like an inhuman cattle market!  \r\nI had to sit surrounded by other patients to receive my IV’s on a chair that was painful and actually exasperated my symptoms. It seemed like no one was afforded any dignity or privacy - I knew everyone’s name and dates of birth and ailments in my vicinity, as they knew mine!  \r\nI eventually ground a doctor who, unlike the nurses, was not avoiding eye contact, to tell them my IV had finished. The doctor asked me to take a seat behind them and they'd get that sorted out. At this point, the nurse who had previously declined my request to move to a vacant and more comfortable seat pointed at me and asked why I was there. I explained I had asked for pain relief and was told that it’s not ideal, but my treatment is over, so I got my drip disconnected and taken - I felt very rudely - out of that area and into the waiting area again, in agony and tears. No pain relief.  \r\nI am waiting for diagnosis and suspected appendicitis. If I need a surgery, I will not let these people anywhere near me with a scalpel!

I was back a day later with regular contractions. After a few hours waiting at MAU I was told my baby had a reduced heartrate and was told I would be taken to labour and delivery to be induced as I still wasn't progressing. The midwives changed shifts and I was forgotten about untill I asked what was happening hours later, the senior midwife said I wasn't contracting enough so why on earth would they send me to labour and delivery. When I asked if she had any handover notes she said she would have to find them, suggesting they hadn't been read in the first place. I was then told I couldn't go to labour and delivery as they were too busy and my baby's heart rate had stabilised, I would have to go back to the ward overnight. This was after being there for 10 hours, with no offer of food and rarely offered water unless I asked.\r\n\r\nThe next morning I was put on the ward with women who had given birth already, eventually left by myself when they were moved on to postnatal, my requests for pain relief or any help in the early hours were met with a lack of compassion that made me feel like I was being a pain. When I told I would have to wait a couple of hours for more paracetamol and then being upset as it wasn't helping I was told by the midwife and I quote \"You don't have to be a martyr, you can have some pethidine\". As a first time Mum I had no idea what pain relief I could have, and felt upset that I was being spoken to like I was just trying to be difficult. The midwife didn't return to give any more pain relief. I was finally taken to labour and delivery to be induced 5 days after my waters had gone. My baby ended up in NICU due to suspectdd sepsis and low blood sugar, when upset about this on the ward, I could hear the young midwives at the desk nearby ridiculing me for being so upset. Going back there to have a baby in the future is my worst nightmare, the thought of even stepping foot back in the building makes me anxious.

I went to the GP and was seen by the nurse who referred me to dermatology as the growth was so quick and a hard skin kept growing over it. I was seen by dermatology within 3 months and they were very helpful and reassuring and referred me to get it removed and sent away.  \r\nI got another appointment within 3 months. On the day I was very nervous and the nurses Kirsty and Laura who were removing the mole were brilliant. Kirsty explained everything to me in depth and made sure I understood the full procedure and what would happen and any aftercare. Laura was so lovely and reassuring and chatted away to me which definitely helped my nerves. As Kirsty was doing the procedure she explained each step and let me know what was going to happen before doing it, which was so good.  \r\nAs uncomfortable and nerve wracking as the procedure was, Kirsty and Laura made such a difference with how they took care of me throughout.

I was very disappointed as I was hoping for a home birth but wasn’t able to due to staff shortage over the weekend. However I was incredibly lucky to have a great experience in hospital!  \r\nThe main factor I was worried about was being in water and I was very lucky as I was able to use the pool. This made a huge difference to me as I’ve birthed successfully in water before so knowing I’d have this made me much more at ease. As I arrived the midwives warmly welcomed us, they had made the room BEAUTIFUL with fairy lights ect, the pool was drawn and music playing! I felt so at ease, fortunately I birthed in the pool not much later.  \r\nMy main midwife present was Rhona and she was just wonderful; experienced, professional, kind, caring and hardworking. Above and beyond doesn’t cut it. Megan and Gemma were midwives who were around as well who were absolutely amazing also! We’re just so impressed and they made being in hospital actually really lovely!  \r\nThere were times during my pregnancy that I called the unit and the midwives were highly professional and helpful on the phone. If I may suggest, it would be lovely if they had introduced themselves by name on the phone. There were times I only found out who it was by the end of the call because I asked and it turned out we had met in the past. Of course I don’t expect to be remembered as you all have so many women you care for. But for me it is highly encouraging and reassuring when I talk to a midwife I have already got a rapport with and know to be lovely, so it helps a lot when I knew who it was I was speaking to. :)I’m very sorry I can’t remember any names but I was made to feel very comfortable and at ease in day care when I was 2 weeks over due and very sad and grumpy about not being in labour! The midwives, receptionist and the registrar were awesome! Thank you to all you hardworking folk in maternity!","criticality":"minimally critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-07-18T19:55:41.6633333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-07-20T08:50:46.567","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":7}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1093251","id":"1093251"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1093251/responses","id":"1093251"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1093251/healthservices","id":"1093251"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1093251/tags","id":"1093251"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/c418h-commaternityunit","id":"c418h-commaternityunit","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/c418h-matcare1","id":"c418h-matcare1","score":5},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/c418h-matdaycare","id":"c418h-matdaycare","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/above%20and%20beyond","id":"above and beyond"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing%20staff","id":"amazing staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/birth","id":"birth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/encouraging","id":"encouraging"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/environment","id":"environment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fortunate","id":"fortunate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helpful","id":"helpful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kind","id":"kind"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/labour","id":"labour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/maternity","id":"maternity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/midwives","id":"midwives"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/music","id":"music"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/positive%20experience","id":"positive experience"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pregnancy","id":"pregnancy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professional","id":"professional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/receptionist","id":"receptionist"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/registrar","id":"registrar"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staffing","id":"Staffing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happy","id":"happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/impressed","id":"impressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassuring","id":"reassuring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/great%20care","id":"Great care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20ease","id":"at ease"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/introducing%20self","id":"introducing self"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1096941","id":"1096941"}]},{"id":1094364,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"The most amazing midwives and nurses ","body":"This was the second time I chose to give birth at Northwick Park  hospital and I had the most amazing nurses, midwives and doctors.I can't thank them enough for what they did.

The ward has no space available for parents to have a day bed or even a recliner, all that is available is a hard tall back chair. This is not adequate to sleep in, especially for post partum mothers. I was extremely uncomfortable all night and spent the whole night awake sitting in pain or standing, unable to follow the medical advice I was given to recover.  \r\nMy son is exclusively breast fed, so leaving his side was not an option and wouldn't of been had he of been bottle fed either as he was 5 days old and it's crucial for our bond to be together. The staff overnight were apologetic about the unfortunate situation I found myself in, but were totally unable to offer any kind of solution.  \r\nThe following morning I was in agony, luckily baby's dad was here to keep an eye on me as I was passing out, sitting in the chair and almost hitting the floor. My wound had started to ooze overnight from sitting so long, unable to lie down and air it out as advised by maternity staff, the amazing nurse on the following day really went above and beyond to try and find some sort of solution as they could see physically the effect the situation was having on me.  \r\nI shared my concerns of my wound and upon showing the nurse they contacted EOU in maternity for me and I went there, which was so busy I then had to walk all the way back to feed my son again and then back to EOU again when they where available to see me. The Dr in EOU reiterated that I needed to lie down and thankfully the nurse had managed to get a free bed space beside my son that I've been able to lie down and rest in. This is only available as the bed was not currently needed, so by complete luck and the nurse's kindness.  \r\nI think this needs to be seriously looked into, there are parents on this ward who have been staying in a chair for the past 6 nights! Who are having to sleep unsafely in the same bed with their small children so they are able to sleep to function and care for them properly.  \r\nI've spoken to other parents, and the number of them found in this position is just unacceptable, in my opinion. Parents literally are sleeping on the floor to try to get some sort of rest. As parents we need to be able to rest, especially at a time when our children are most vulnerable, we are their advocates and decision makers!  \r\nDue to this situation I have found my self totally exhausted, back on multiple pain killers with an oozing wound and an antibiotic prescription, unable to care for my beautiful new born son on my own and having to pump to allow dad to feed our son as I physically am not well enough. I'm extremely lucky to have a partner that is here to help me, I dread to think of how much worse the situation would be if I was also a single parent.  \r\nI've been admitted to the Royal children's with my daughter previously and was always offered a day bed for admissions, and even a recliner in A&E.  \r\nI feel like things need to change!","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-07-19T20:10:32.66","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-07-20T09:20:00.34","readBy":[{"name":"South Eastern Health and Social Care Trust","count":8},{"name":"Patient and Client Council","count":1},{"name":"Public Health Agency","count":1},{"name":"Ulster University, Faculty of Life and Health Sciences","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1093808","id":"1093808"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1093808/responses","id":"1093808"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1093808/healthservices","id":"1093808"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1093808/tags","id":"1093808"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt004_07021-eou","id":"zt004_07021-eou","score":3},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt004_07021-ms","id":"zt004_07021-ms","score":1},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/angry","id":"angry"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing%20staff","id":"amazing staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/baby","id":"baby"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/beds","id":"beds"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breast","id":"breast"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/c%20section","id":"c section"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emotional","id":"emotional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/exhausted","id":"exhausted"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/facilities","id":"facilities"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/jaundice","id":"jaundice"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/maternity","id":"maternity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/section","id":"section"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/the%20change","id":"the change"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/uncomfortable","id":"uncomfortable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wound","id":"wound"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breast%20pump","id":"breast pump"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1095658","id":"1095658"}]},{"id":1093344,"author":"greenxd84","authorRoleId":4,"authorRole":"a relative","title":"Failing system","body":"3 years of going round in circles, the inability to provide the correct support and treatment surrounding OCD.

Without the support and care of the staff I would have had a C-section again, they truly made his birth possible and when things got scary when he was born the whole team on Labour ward were quick on their feet and made sure that my little boy was okay.  \r\nI will never be able to thank the staff involved in both of our care enough for everything they have done for us in the 2 weeks I spent on Bassett Ward.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-07-19T08:12:44.22","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-07-20T09:39:52.07","readBy":[{"name":"Royal Devon University Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust","count":6}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1093459","id":"1093459"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1093459/responses","id":"1093459"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1093459/healthservices","id":"1093459"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1093459/tags","id":"1093459"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rh880_501","id":"RH880_501","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/all%20staff","id":"all staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/great%20experience","id":"Great experience"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helpful","id":"helpful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/maternity","id":"maternity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/positive","id":"positive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/safe","id":"safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported","id":"supported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/great%20team","id":"great team"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/comfortable","id":"comfortable"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1097209","id":"1097209"}]},{"id":1093518,"author":"Hummi","authorRoleId":3,"authorRole":"a parent/guardian","title":"Relaxed development review.","body":"I came to visit the EYW for my son's development review.

This wasn’t just the doctors and nurses but includes portering staff (I had loads of tests) domestic services teams (fab chats!!) and pharmacy staff.  \r\nI had wonderful care and listening teams. I’d also like to thank catering teams as meals were great. I wasn’t going home without having my lunch.  \r\nI’m in the middle of having longer term Glasgow treatment and this was a glitch I didn’t need, but they all helped me through it with positivity
