They took great care to tell me what I should expect. When the time arrived I walked along to the theatre with my surgeon and anaesthetic staff where we settled into the anaesthetic room. Everyone was very chatty, and friendly, managing to keep any nerves at bay. I had a spinal anaesthetic, with nerve block and local injections so there was no chance of feeling any pain. Once I was settled in a comfortable position, I went to sleep, knowing no more until I woke up in the recovery room, with lots of people to keep me company until it was time to move to the ward which would continue my care.  \r\nThe National Treatment Centre, a COVID free ward, looked after me with great compassion, making sure I was pain-free at all times and always had everything I might need. The next day, after a visit from the physiotherapists and my lovely surgeon, I was allowed to go home, just 36 hours after I had arrived. My stay was short but very sweet and I am delighted to be rid of the pain which has been curtailing my activities for years.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-05-24T16:02:16.25","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-05-25T09:26:03.097","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Forth Valley","count":10}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/849293","id":"849293"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/849293/responses","id":"849293"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/849293/healthservices","id":"849293"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/849293/tags","id":"849293"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/forth-valley-royal_inpatients_physiotherapy","id":"forth-valley-royal_Inpatients_Physiotherapy","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/forth-valley-royal-day-surgery","id":"forth-valley-royal-day-surgery","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/forth-valley-royal-orthopaedic","id":"forth-valley-royal-orthopaedic","score":5},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/forth-valley-royal-seu","id":"forth-valley-royal-SEU","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/forth-valley-royal-theatre","id":"forth-valley-royal-theatre","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anaesthetic","id":"Anaesthetic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/delighted","id":"delighted"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/food","id":"food"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/great","id":"great"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kept%20informed","id":"kept informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/knee","id":"knee"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/knee%20replacement","id":"knee replacement"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain%20free","id":"pain free"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/person-centred","id":"person-centred"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/private%20room","id":"private room"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professionalism","id":"professionalism"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/spinal","id":"spinal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/spinal%20anaesthetic","id":"spinal anaesthetic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/total%20knee%20replacement","id":"Total Knee Replacement"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/welcomed","id":"welcomed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20for","id":"cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassionate","id":"compassionate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid","id":"covid"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%2019","id":"covid 19"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/851299","id":"851299"}]},{"id":849177,"author":"Cmm86","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Open, honest and friendly","body":"A really open, honest and friendly consultation that pre-empted a lot of my questions and concerns but also made me feel I could ask any additional questions.

I can not thank everybody enough from the Doctors, Nurses and all the support staff, including the auxiliary staff who rarely get a mention.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-05-23T20:51:53.7066667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-05-25T10:46:48.073","readBy":[{"name":"BPP University, BSc Nursing (Adult) 2019-03","count":1},{"name":"BPP University, School of Nursing","count":1},{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":8}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/849129","id":"849129"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/849129/responses","id":"849129"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/849129/healthservices","id":"849129"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/849129/tags","id":"849129"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/c418h_100","id":"C418H_100","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/worried","id":"worried"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bowel","id":"bowel"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bowel%20surgery","id":"Bowel surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/consultant","id":"consultant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/discharge%20lounge","id":"Discharge lounge"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctors","id":"doctors"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/face","id":"face"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurse","id":"nurse"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pre%20op","id":"pre op"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professionalism","id":"professionalism"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/secretary","id":"secretary"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/small%20bowel%20surgery","id":"small bowel surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/walk","id":"walk"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/well%20looked%20after","id":"well looked after"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fantastic","id":"fantastic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ancillary%20staff","id":"Ancillary staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20ease","id":"at ease"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20worried","id":"not worried"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/theatre%20team","id":"theatre team"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bowel%20nurse","id":"bowel nurse"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/849624","id":"849624"}]},{"id":849124,"author":"SKTroon","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Fantastic from start to finish!","body":"Having had my hip operation cancelled twice in the past year due to Covid, it went ahead last week at Ayr Hospital.

It is often difficult to feel included on a personal level on platforms such as Zoom - particularly with larger audiences. I have had considerable difficulties with this myself, which is why for some time I refused to include myself in group sessions held online.  \r\nHaving been convinced by Adrian one day to “feel the fear, but do it anyway” I reluctantly attended one of his Zoom sessions. Looking back, I only wish I'd done so sooner. I cannot fathom how somebody can dominate, and captivate, such a sizeable (and at times, rowdy!) audience. His delivery is dynamic and engrossing - the session content seems structured without being scripted, and there is always opportunity for personal interaction. Above all - and most importantly for me - his humanistic, attentive approach makes every subject matter relatable. In turn, I have been inspired to apply what I have learned through him to better my life (and behaviours) significantly. With thanks to Adrian for both the initial nudge and the running of these sessions, I am understanding my worth and my capabilities. No longer bound by my past or by unnecessary guilt. I owe my sobriety to the whole of CGL, but my personal growth to him.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-05-23T17:45:27.8733333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-05-25T10:53:02.727","readBy":[{"name":"Change Grow Live","count":4}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/849114","id":"849114"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/849114/responses","id":"849114"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/849114/healthservices","id":"849114"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/849114/tags","id":"849114"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/nms-cambridgeshire-wisbech","id":"nms-cambridgeshire-wisbech","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/included","id":"included"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/inspirational","id":"inspirational"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/inspired","id":"inspired"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/personal","id":"personal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/welcoming","id":"welcoming"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thankful","id":"Thankful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/substance%20misuse%20support","id":"substance misuse support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thought%20provoking","id":"thought provoking"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/849658","id":"849658"}]},{"id":849128,"author":"Dusty T","authorRoleId":4,"authorRole":"a relative","title":"My 80 year old Dads Visit to Day Surgery.

I had a fast-track recovery in hospital, again the staff were so supportive and helpful and was back home 4 days after a major operation. I had been told that it would be a 4 to 6 week recovery and was contacted by someone on the oncology team every day for the first 2 weeks. I was encouraged to be active, slowly with small steps to begin with. I enjoy walking so that wasn't a problem and each day I gave myself a goal of walking a little further. It was tiring and frustrating but eventually I got used to the \"no bending, no stretching \" rule!  \r\n4 weeks into my recovery and I was starting to feel so much better and more positive mentally too. I recieved a phone call from one of my support nurses who gave me a round-up of the histology report. As well as removing the tumour. They had removed 22 lymph nodes, 2 if which showed signs of cancerous cells, so the news was that I was to go onto 3 months of chemotherapy, 4 cycles in total just to make sure they got it all. In an instant I had gone from recovery mode back to preparation mode. I knew it was another step forward to full recovery but in my heart I felt I'd taken several steps back.  \r\nI met my oncologist, who fully explained the chemical combination I would be taking and a whole range of potential side effects (some were scary, but you do need to have all the information). It was a lot to take in, but it made me feel better...I prefer working on facts rather than 'if, buts and maybe. Plus there was always Claire or Chrissie to talk to if I had any concerns. I also had a 24 hour emergency phone number that I could ring if I had any concerns regarding side effects I was experiencing and yes, I have used it and yes, they too were wonderfully understanding and supportive.  \r\nI have been fortunate enough to experience the lesser of the side effects (I have wondered if that is because the cancer was caught early), including pins and needles in my fingertips and throat cramps, both resulting from a sensitivity to temperature changes. Easily coped with if you remember to wear gloves when handling cold things like metal pans and cutlery or going into the fridge or freezer. Oh, and run the hot tap when you go to the loo at 3am! You only forget to do that once! The only pain I experienced was a reaction to the drug which is the one you get through the drip at the start of each cycle. This was relieved by the insertion of a PICC line which fed the drug directly into my larger vein.  \r\nMy only other problem was that my bone marrow reacted badly to the chemo and a couple of times I had to wait a week to two longer to enable my white cell count to recover so I could begin the next cycle. Frustrating but nothing to be done, it was explained to me that it wasnt anything I was or wasn't doing.  \r\nNow I'm in my final cycle. I have spent 2 hours at the Headlands Unit at Treliske (again, brilliantly supportive, friendly staff) on the drip and have rung the bell that celebrates your last visit and recovery. I am on my last 2 weeks of chemo tablets at home. Its tiring for the first week but each day it becomes a little easier and I'm looking forward to a camping trip with the family at the end if June, something I wasn't sure I was going to be able to attend.  \r\nI look back at the last 5 months and it all feels a little surreal. The one thing that does feel real is all the help and support I have had from every member of staff at Treliske who has been on my journey with me. It doesnt finish now either; I will go onto a 5 year surveillance program which includes further CT scans and a colonoscopy. In the meantime I'm looking forward to enjoying new things in my life as well as getting out to meet up with family and friends eventually...pandemic permitting of course!","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-05-23T16:18:04.2866667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-05-25T11:18:32.987","readBy":[{"name":"Royal Cornwall Hospitals NHS Trust","count":15}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/849112","id":"849112"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/849112/responses","id":"849112"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/849112/healthservices","id":"849112"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/849112/tags","id":"849112"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/ref12_370","id":"REF12_370","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bone","id":"bone"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bowel","id":"bowel"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bowel%20cancer","id":"bowel cancer"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cancer","id":"cancer"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/chemo","id":"chemo"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/chemotherapy","id":"chemotherapy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/colonoscopy","id":"colonoscopy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ct","id":"ct"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/drug","id":"drug"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/encouraged","id":"encouraged"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fortunate","id":"fortunate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/informative%20staff","id":"Informative Staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lymph%20nodes","id":"lymph nodes"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/marrow","id":"marrow"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/oncologist","id":"oncologist"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/oncology","id":"oncology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/operation","id":"operation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/positive","id":"positive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/rectal","id":"rectal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/signs","id":"signs"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supportive%20staff","id":"supportive staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/throat","id":"throat"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tumour","id":"Tumour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/walking","id":"walking"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/relieved","id":"relieved"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported","id":"supported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/valued","id":"valued"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/timely%20treatment","id":"timely treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/feel%20better","id":"feel better"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fast%20recovery","id":"fast recovery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pandemic","id":"pandemic"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/851301","id":"851301"}]},{"id":849113,"author":"Penfoldio","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Very professional","body":"Had both vaccinations at Parkgate Community Centre Rosyth.

My c-section experience was also amazing - again all staff being so amazing and reassuring especially due to my severe anxiety issues. The following day after my sons birth was as expected very difficult pain wise due to having disability that effect my mobility anyways. It's because of one day of my stay that my experience has left me unable to speak about my time in hospital. What should have been a loving and memorable moment to share, a member of staff made me doubt myself as a new mum. The previous evening, a student midwife offered to take my son during the night to let me get some rest which I appreciated so so much. Especially as one of my disability includes chronic fatigue.  \r\nIn the morning the student midwife brought my son back through and he got very upset - I still wasn’t very mobile so therefore I got very upset as it was quite distressing seeing my baby boy screaming and I couldn’t get to him. Another staff member then came over to my bed and very rudely told me that they didn’t know why I was crying, that I was very lucky that someone had him overnight and that they were going to speak to doctors as it felt like I didn’t want to care for my son. This brought on a huge panic attack for me... I asked if anyone was available to talk to me to help me calm down and was told that everyone was too busy (which I do appreciate) that I had to just get on with it. I was terrified that this person was going to suggest my baby being taken away from me. During the two hour slot for my partner to come in the same staff member returned as she wanted to talk to my partner about my mental health. My partner reiterated that due to my anxiety and fatigue I get tired and sore very easily and that the best thing for me would be to go home as I had a huge support network ready to help us. Once again this staff member repeated that they were concerned over my mental health in a room with 3 other mums and continued to ask my partner if he felt I could care for my son - he answered no purely for the fact that due to my mobility issues after having a section. Now it’s very easy to hear what each other are being told - I was mortified once again. We had an agreement that as long as I was seen doing things independently, which was very difficult for me, I would be allowed to go home. So I had to push through to do it so that this person would agree to let me home. By the end of the day they were being helpful, but the morning time was just horrible.  \r\nI’m currently going through counseling as throughout my pregnancy I wasn’t on any anti-depressants as they made me poorly and the main subject of my counseling is my post-partum period.  \r\nMy little boy is absolutely thriving and is doing amazing. The only reason I feel ready to leave my feedback as to what happened to me is I now believe that I’ve always been a good mum. One staff member's words are irrelevant, I realise they have a duty of care however there are kinder and better ways to go about it.  \r\nI just hope that it was just that they were having a bad day - although I had a huge support system I cried for the first two weeks of my son's life. It dampened all the memories of my hospital experience.  \r\nI wish they had a better understanding and consideration for those with mental & physical issues.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-05-23T16:15:49.9133333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-05-25T11:53:15.28","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Education for Scotland","count":1},{"name":"NHS Grampian","count":10},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2022)","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/849111","id":"849111"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/849111/responses","id":"849111"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/849111/healthservices","id":"849111"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/849111/tags","id":"849111"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/n161h_501","id":"N161H_501","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/distressing","id":"distressing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/terrified","id":"terrified"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anti%20depressants","id":"anti depressants"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/birth","id":"birth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/concerned","id":"concerned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/counselling","id":"counselling"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/c-section","id":"c-section"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disability","id":"disability"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/empathy","id":"empathy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fatigue","id":"fatigue"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/horrible","id":"horrible"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kindness","id":"kindness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/labour","id":"labour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lucky","id":"lucky"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health%20awareness","id":"Mental health Awareness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mobility","id":"mobility"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/panic","id":"panic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/panic%20attack","id":"panic attack"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pregnancy","id":"pregnancy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/section","id":"section"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/triage","id":"triage"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/understanding","id":"understanding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing","id":"amazing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/calm","id":"calm"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hope","id":"Hope"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassuring","id":"reassuring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/invisible%20disability","id":"invisible disability"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/student%20midwife","id":"student midwife"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/one%20staff%20member","id":"one staff member"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/comments%20made","id":"comments made"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/theatre%20team","id":"theatre team"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/850521","id":"850521"}]},{"id":849637,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Very positive patient experience","body":"My optician referred me in November, and advised me that waiting times were short, and that Spa Medica had an excellent reputation.

My husband who is in he's 70's, is undergoing cancer treatment and so he is extremely vulnerable. He had to turn down his first offer of his 2nd vaccine due to impending cancer treatment which would have been affected by it. While he was an in-patient in the hospital he was denied the 2nd vaccine when offered a 2nd time by the GP. It was now clinically suitable but the hospital told us that they had no access to vaccine! So my husband was left vulnerable for over 4 weeks in hospital as they had no means to get one for him.  \r\nThe GP surgery thought we were being difficult but we were told we could not discharge him for a vaccine as it was too 'impractical' to re-admit him due to COVID restrictions. I don't think anyone so vulnerable should have to fight for the 2nd vaccine or stay in a hospital with COVID patients in the building without being vaccinated.  \r\nOur experience led us to believe that patients in hospitals are being denied vaccine and left vulnerable to infection. 6 weeks after his first offer, my husband has finally had his 2nd vaccine as the nursing home would not take him without it. But the hospital had to discharge him, put him in a taxi and transport him to the GP and back to get it.  \r\nThe fact that in our experience hospitals have no vaccine feels shocking on the part of the NHS which must be affecting vulnerable patients up and down the country.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-05-13T14:04:36.35","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-05-25T12:27:59.917","readBy":[{"name":"Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust ","count":1},{"name":"Healthwatch Sheffield","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/846012","id":"846012"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/846012/responses","id":"846012"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/846012/healthservices","id":"846012"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/846012/tags","id":"846012"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/03n","id":"03n","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rhqhh_303","id":"RHQHH_303","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/angry","id":"angry"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cancer","id":"cancer"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cancer%20treatment","id":"cancer treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%20vaccine","id":"covid vaccine"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/850088","id":"850088"}]},{"id":849216,"author":"sagittart86","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Mirena Removal","body":"Made to feel very comfortable and at ease.

Jumping to conclusions.  \r\nI find there’s a pattern of CPNs giving me false promises of treatment and then a few weeks later tell me they don’t think I’m eligible. I dont feel listened to and it’s just a ticking boxes process which was admitted to me by one member of staff.  \r\nThey have over stepped their boundaries on one occasion and got away with it, when they turned up at my house unannounced last year. The conversations seems repetitive, circular and in some cases manipulative. If I don’t want to talk about certain things I dont feel they shouldn’t keep pushing.  \r\nI hate that they end all conversations with “are you suicidal” and thinks that’s an appropriate way to conclude a call. I have found this service used to be good when a different psychiatrist was there. Past staff I found to be nicer also. I felt listened to and spoken to like a human being, and my previous doctor I felt knew when I was well and when I was not & remembered conversations we had.  \r\nI found that previous staff used to listen and give you resources to help. And there was a period I didn’t need their help. But obviously things happen and I’m with them again, but Now it’s just a joke.  \r\nAnd as for the County Crisis Team, my experience of this team is no better either, I did ring the team on one occasion, but the member of staff on the line I found to be rude and seemed a bit out of it so I ended the call.  \r\nI’m not the type to write negative reviews, but from what I have experienced I find this service is cold. I just want to be discharged, but three weeks in, still not discharged or spoken to the manager.  \r\n","criticality":"moderately

Therefore, I wrote a letter explaining my husband's medical problems, which I personally delivered to the surgery.  The receptionist asked me what was in the letter and I told her it was a request for an appointment or a call-back.  I was told I could not obtain an appointment by this method and would have to phone.  I explained I had been phoning for two weeks.  'You'll just have to try again tomorrow', she said, 'Or, you can go to the Drop-in Centre or phone 111.'  At this point, I made the rather silly comment, 'someone could die while they are trying to contact the surgery'.   She replied, 'Well, if it was an emergency, you'd ring 999'.   I told her it was not a life-or-death situation but my husband needed GP care.  I asked the receptionist if she was going to pass my letter to a clinician or chuck it in the bin.  The receptionist just went into \"broken record mode\" -  'You'll have to keep phoning or go to the Walk-in Centre', so I really do  not know whether my letter will reach someone who can help my husband.  At this point, I gave up and went home.  I will try to phone again tomorrow but I do not hold out much hope.  Usually, I have always been the first to defend the NHS but this is becoming increasingly difficult.  It seems unless you have Covid symptoms, the NHS (or maybe it is just this particular surgery) does not want to know.  My husband's health has not reached a crisis that would justify a 999 call but he is very unwell and needs medical attention, which seems impossible to acquire these days.  I really despair!   I am not angry with the receptionist, who was just doing her job.  However, Primary Care in the UK seems to be non-existent.  I am angry with a system that does not allow the patient to have contact with a clinician when they need it.  Actually, on reflection, I shall be very angry with that receptionist if she does not pass my letter to a clinician.  I do not think phoning 111 and being told to attend A&E is the correct solution.  My husband needs ongoing care from his GP but this seems impossible to obtain.   I would very much appreciate a reply to my comments from the surgery but I won't hold my breath as it seems that is not something they do.  Actually, do they even read the comments?  I do appreciate that these are very difficult times because of Covid but should Primary Care just abandon their patients?","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2021-05-24T20:20:23","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2021-05-25T12:46:28","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/849664","id":"849664"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/849664/responses","id":"849664"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/849664/healthservices","id":"849664"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/849664/tags","id":"849664"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/c81042","id":"C81042","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/angry","id":"angry"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/crisis","id":"crisis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/broken","id":"broken"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/death","id":"death"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/despair","id":"despair"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/die","id":"die"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disabled","id":"disabled"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency","id":"emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hope","id":"Hope"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/no%20hope","id":"no hope"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid","id":"covid"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%2019","id":"covid 19"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20home","id":"at home"}]},{"id":849162,"author":"Jean-Pierre","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Unsure of how to get my results","body":"My GP referred me to Cardiology in Forth Valley Royal Hospital. Then I have had an telephone appointment with a consultant Cardiologist who suggested to organise an Echocardiogram and a Scan. I have had both done but no results have been communicated to me and I have no idea when this will be done and how. On the leaflet sent to me in preparation for the scan it is only mentioned 'we will send the results to the Doctor who asked for your scan'.  \r\nThe care I received on the day by the staff was wonderful, especially from the Nurses who looked after me and made sure I was ok all the way through. They were so kind and helpful, really heart warming. What was not good is not being told anything regarding my results. The consultant cardiologist was in the Scan room and stood next to me for a few minutes while I was being placed on the machine but I have no idea why they were there as this was not explained to me. Back in the ward, I've asked about how and when the results would be communicated to me but the answer was vague and I only understood that it would take some time i.e. maybe a few weeks.  \r\nThis makes me feel stressed. I have been suffering for a year from the condition for which these investigations are being done and not having visibility on how and when the results will be communicated to me adds to the anxiety. I can only assume that if the Echo and/or the Scan revealed something serious then I would have been told.

On arrival at the Pharmacists she was told she should never be referred to them because of her existing medical condition and that she needed to see her doctor, she asked why she was referred if the practice know she can not be seen by the Pharmacist, she was told \"they just send everyone, most people we can't help\". My wife walked from the Pharmacists to the doctors and spoke to the receptionist only to be told that even though she was standing right there in front of the computer she could not book my wife in for an appointment because she needed to phone. My wife returned home and joined the call que at number 18. When the call was answered she asked why it had taken 6 hours for her to finally reach the stage where she could book an appointment, she was told they hadn't realised she was a cancer patient even though this is clear on her records and her details were taken during the original call. My wife was told \"we don't have time to look at the computer\".\n\nThis is a shambolic Practice, with pharmacist consultations apparently being used to deflect/delay patients regardless of the severity of there existing medical conditions. I find the implication that the receptionist or call handler (apparently acting as a gate keeper to NHS medical services) would not have time to do their job properly (but stage 4 cancer patients have all the time in the world) utterly disgusting. The inadequacy of the Colliery Practice appointment system and its application resulted in the wasted time of my wife, the Pharmacists, and the Practices own staff.  This is just the last example of the Colliery Practices incompetence with the only successful or satisfactory appointment my wife has ever had was with a locum doctor. If their was a single doctors practice in the area taking on patients we would leave.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2021-05-24T20:31:05","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-05-25T12:47:22","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/849663","id":"849663"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/849663/responses","id":"849663"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/849663/healthservices","id":"849663"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/849663/tags","id":"849663"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/m83638","id":"M83638","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cancer","id":"cancer"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20home","id":"at home"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/849907","id":"849907"}]},{"id":849662,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Extremely unprofessional ","body":"At least one hours wait before the call is answered!

I was nervous and had reservations that therapy could even help me. Believe me, I felt that I did not want to live on this earth any more.  \r\nThe initial assessment was done with compassion and the wait to get to therapy was around 2-3mths.  \r\nMy therapist Maame was amazing. She helped me to break down all of my feelings,, emotions and habits so I could see the damage my negative thinking and negative learnt behaviour from childhood was impacting on my life.  \r\nEach week has been both difficult and enlightening as I have become more aware of myself - and this means I am now conscious of where my thoughts are taking me - which in turn affects my behaviours.  \r\nTherapy for me is ongoing. I am not ‘cured’ (something at the start I thought I would be) but I am ‘equipped’ - which is exactly where I need to be. I am learning to ‘go with the flow’ of life and not resisting it. I am learning the only person I have control over is me - and as such, I do not have to be negative. I do have a lot of positive qualities I have overlooked and taken for granted.  \r\nI have just finished - today in fact - my sessions with Maame and whilst i am nervous that I am ‘now on my own’ as such, she has helped me to have faith in myself and my abilities to continue growing in myself.  \r\nI have had ups and downs throughout my therapy and I am not critical to myself about them as this is what will and does happen. My negative view of myself had been there for years, so it will not change overnight, but with my awareness and the tools I gained in my sessions, I can ‘accept and activate positive change for me’.  \r\nI can only sincerely thank Maame and everyone at Inclusion Thurrock for helping me to get to love and accept me.  \r\nIf you feel like you can no longer cope, please do give therapy a try when you are ready to. It does take work. It means opening up to you - to your own self - but you will find you are not alone and you don’t have to live in the pain you are currently in.  \r\nI have a long journey still in front of me, but I have knowledge of all the things I can do and use to help it be a productive and positive one for me.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-05-24T12:18:29.5533333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-05-25T13:04:47.157","readBy":[{"name":"Midlands Partnership NHS Foundation Trust","count":5}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/849238","id":"849238"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/849238/responses","id":"849238"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/849238/healthservices","id":"849238"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/849238/tags","id":"849238"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rrex4-inclusion-thurrock","id":"rrex4-inclusion-thurrock","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nervous","id":"nervous"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/calmer","id":"calmer"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/depression","id":"depression"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helped","id":"helped"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/in%20control","id":"in control"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/learning","id":"learning"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/positive","id":"positive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/risk%20assessment","id":"risk assessment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stronger","id":"stronger"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/therapy","id":"therapy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassion","id":"compassion"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confidence","id":"confidence"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/release%20of%20anxiety","id":"release of anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/brave","id":"brave"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/low%20self%20esteem","id":"low self esteem"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/low%20self%20confidence","id":"low self confidence"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/negative%20thinking","id":"negative thinking"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/more%20aware","id":"more aware"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/901248","id":"901248"}]},{"id":849286,"author":"NSMgz48","authorRoleId":3,"authorRole":"a parent/guardian","title":"Staff were brilliant","body":"All NHS staff were brilliant before and after my sons operation in May.
