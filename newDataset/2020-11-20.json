I was unexpectedly admitted to crosshouse hospital with severe abdominal pain. Unfortunately I still have this and nothing was done except bloods, urine and CT scan.  \r\nTwo days after my admission I had the pleasure of meeting a nurse on the ward who was so rude and nasty to myself and other patients on the ward. Once I decided to go for a walk to the lifts and back, but before I could get to the doors of the ward they shouted at me, asking where the f### do I thought I was going. I told her I was simply going to stretch my legs as they are sore. The nurse shouted back at me, telling me to get back to my f###in bed right now or they would pour ice cold water over me. I was appalled at what they had just said to me. No wonder some consultants on the ward turned around.  \r\nA nurse is there to look after vulnerable patients and to help them get well etc, not to make them feel small and unsafe. I saw the nurse in question do this to many patients on that day that it's bang out of order.  \r\nAll the other nurses on this ward deserve a medal as I can't fault them. Even through the covid pandemic.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-11-18T00:19:16.4633333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-11-20T09:20:00.627","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Ayrshire & Arran","count":13},{"name":"St. Andrews University ScotGEM Medical Students","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/804059","id":"804059"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/804059/responses","id":"804059"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/804059/healthservices","id":"804059"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/804059/tags","id":"804059"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/a111h_300","id":"A111H_300","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appalled","id":"appalled"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/abdominal","id":"abdominal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ct%20scan","id":"CT scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/legs","id":"legs"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attitude","id":"staff attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vulnerable","id":"vulnerable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/one%20staff%20member","id":"one staff member"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unsafe","id":"unsafe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pandemic","id":"pandemic"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/809052","id":"809052"}]},{"id":804229,"author":"scoopyoiseau","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Recent experience","body":"Hello,  \r\nI visited Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre for a face - to - face appointment in the outpatients department. I don't want to start with the carparking but I will - the payment pods weren't taking card payments only cash (tricky during a cashless covid!) and being cashless and with the card machine in the foyer out of service I had to park without paying - sorry about that. I think they've only been accepting cash for a few weeks so advance warning in the letter might be a good idea.  \r\nThe lady who worked on the outpatient booking desk in the foyer and the gentleman on the desk in the outpatient department were very polite and helpful showing me where to go.  \r\nThe Dr who my appointment was with was also great - good communication, very polite, asked if i had any questions and told me what would happen next.  \r\nThe only real negative was overhearing two staff members at a desk next to the seating area talking about a patient one of them had just seen which included detail of the test and how the patient wasn't right about something. I know staff need to talk about patients but perhaps if the conversation is going to include detail of how a patient was being a little bit awkward this shouldn't be done next to a seating area for other patients to overhear.

A very kind and caring Ambulance Team had come to my rescue at my home in Rigside, near Lanark. They had found me lying on the concrete in my back yard. I had fallen from a very high step ladder whilst collecting elderberries. On arrival at hospital I became aware that I was broken in mind, body and spirit.  \r\nIt was Dr Ryan who first looked after me. Having refused pain relief in the ambulance Dr Ryan soon sorted me out. After visiting the Xray Department it was Dr Ryan who explained exactly how many bones I had broken. I remember saying that I had to go home because I had so many pets which relied on me. He explained that if I wasn’t treated I would most likely never walk again. I got the message.  \r\nWhat happened to me through that first night is very hazy. Various procedures were carried out and I only remember feeling terribly thirsty and not understanding why I couldn’t have a drink of water. I have no idea when I was eventually taken to Ward 15.  \r\nI have a very bad memory of my time on Ward 15, not because of my own pain but because of a fellow patient who persisted in howling out her pain constantly. This howling, crying and screeching was truly unbearable. In fact, when I was being prepared to go to theatre early on Sunday morning I couldn’t wait to go to get some peace. I was later to learn from other patients that they’d suffered the same fate on Ward 15.  \r\nThe operations went well and thanks to an incredible team in the theatre I was blissfully unaware of whatever procedures were performed on me. I was taken from there to the ACCU (Adult Crisis Care Unit). I soon became very frightened indeed as wires and tubes were attached to me and the pain built and built into total agony. This was when my mental state began to deteriorate. The fear gave me the strong impulse to flee. I remember, especially during the night, pulling out tubes and wires to free myself so that I could escape. My bed was close to the nurses station and they were ever alert to my antics.  \r\nI’m not sure which night it was but I just wanted it all to end and called out for help to kill myself. This turned out to be my turning point. Someone looked into my eyes and told me severely that I wasn’t going to die. I began to accept my situation and begin the process of allowing the medical professionals to heal me.  \r\nDay by day life on the extremely busy ward became easier. I soon began to feel overwhelmed by the kindness shown to me by one and all. I became an observer and watched, with great fascination, as each team seemingly danced through their 12 hour shifts. Every team member both smiled and laughed as they tackled their enormous workload. The atmosphere on the ward was so very special.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-11-18T16:20:35.4066667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-11-20T09:59:32.18","readBy":[{"name":"Scottish Ambulance Service","count":12},{"name":"NHS Lanarkshire","count":9},{"name":"Office of Colin Smyth, MSP for South Scotland","count":1},{"name":"North Lanarkshire Health & Social Care Partnership","count":1},{"name":"South Lanarkshire Health and Social Care Forum","count":1},{"name":"Scottish Government","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/804292","id":"804292"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/804292/responses","id":"804292"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/804292/healthservices","id":"804292"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/804292/tags","id":"804292"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l308h_110","id":"L308H_110","score":5},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l308h_180","id":"L308H_180","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l308h-accu","id":"L308H-ACCU","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/scot-ambulance-emergency","id":"scot-ambulance-emergency","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/all%20staff","id":"all staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/broken%20bones","id":"broken bones"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctors","id":"doctors"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency","id":"emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kindness","id":"kindness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain%20relief","id":"pain relief"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgical%20team","id":"surgical team"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tubes","id":"tubes"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ward%20atmosphere","id":"ward atmosphere"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/xray","id":"Xray"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/smiling%20staff","id":"smiling staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thanks","id":"thanks"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/804863","id":"804863"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/804920","id":"804920"}]},{"id":804837,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Unprofessional ","body":"Got called today for phone appointment. \nWhat a unprofessional doctor he was, rude uncaring and totally portentous.\nWhat doctor says what do you want me to do about it?????

I must also say I came across polite doctors and nurses.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-11-20T08:47:56","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-11-20T10:28:22","readBy":[{"name":"The Oaks Medical Centre","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/804851","id":"804851"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/804851/responses","id":"804851"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/804851/healthservices","id":"804851"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/804851/tags","id":"804851"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/m85060","id":"M85060","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good","id":"good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/parking","id":"parking"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pharmacy","id":"Pharmacy"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/813607","id":"813607"}]},{"id":804850,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Great practise","body":"I just want to say this surgery is the best surgery our family have used.

I was getting better and stronger. Learning to look at situations in a different light. Then I lost my nan, the reason I started my journey, I took it badly and felt like giving up. With Ian’s reassurance and support I got through it, 8weeks after my nans passing I was back, better then before. Knowing I can’t give up. I think my sessions have taught me to look at things in a different light to breath and look at situations before making my decisions, yes it’s been hard, but I’m so glad I’ve done this journey in my life. I don’t feel like I carry worry as much as I did before. I now know how to deal with my head and not shout and loose my temper with my little one.

Upon arrival to a and e I had to have my blood pressure, temperature and medical history taken in a busy waiting room.  \r\nThe nurse straight away went and got a consultant that asked why I was there as I have terminal cancer, saying they can’t fix me so it was pointless me being there. I said I was in pain and that needed addressing as I was uncomfortable. This Dr then proceeded to ask why I didn’t get my cancer seen to earlier and how rare my cancer is as I’m so young and to then remind me I’m palliative and there was nothing they could do with me.  \r\nAfter having waited for over 30 minutes in the waiting room it was decided I should be isolated due to being in active treatment even though I had made that known upon my arrival.  \r\nI was lead to a room with just a chair and left where a Dr then came in and changed their mind about my treatment 4 times. They had prescribed me a pain medication I was never brought, 3 hrs later they wanted to iv me a pain medication I’m already taking. I said there was no point as I was already taking that medication so they decided to write me a prescription for an increased dose and said I could go to Asda to collect it. I have never felt so sad and having stage 4 cancer is hard enough I don’t need to be constantly reminded of my fate.  \r\nI went to Asda with my prescription to be told by the pharmacist they could not issue me with my medication as the script had 4 mistakes on including no dosage, no amounts and no frequency in which to take the drug. It also didn’t state on the script that it was a controlled drug. I was informed it would be illegal to prescribe me this drug due to the lack of information on the script.  \r\nBy this time it’s nearly 9pm and I decide to go home as I don’t want to go sit back in the crowded waiting room of the a and e department for them to rectify their mistake as I was exhausted and still in pain. I then had to call my gp the following morning to get a correct prescription issued. I wasn’t even examined to find the cause of my pain, which might not necessarily be the cancer.  \r\nIt was almost like I had been written off when I walked through the door. This experience now leaves me hesitant to attend there in the future for any of my care needs. A little sensitivity and respect would be wonderful. I wonder if they would say to an elderly person why are you here don’t you know how old you are and your probably going to die soon anyway because your old. So why as a person in their 30s who could have another 10+yrs with manageable treatment be treated this way?","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-11-17T19:24:20.4233333","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2020-11-20T11:28:19.383","readBy":[{"name":"United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust","count":4}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/803979","id":"803979"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/803979/responses","id":"803979"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/803979/healthservices","id":"803979"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/803979/tags","id":"803979"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rwdla_180","id":"RWDLA_180","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/isolated","id":"isolated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sad","id":"sad"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cancer","id":"cancer"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/concerned","id":"concerned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/examination","id":"examination"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/exhausted","id":"exhausted"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/palliative","id":"palliative"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/prescription%20problem","id":"Prescription problem"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/rare%20cancer","id":"rare cancer"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sensitivity","id":"sensitivity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/uncomfortable","id":"uncomfortable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20concerned","id":"very concerned"}]},{"id":804886,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Great practice and great doctor ","body":"Fantastic phone call consultation, gave me more information then what I have been given over the past 3 years for my medical problem.

On day after surgery nurse in charge did not know who my daughter's consultant was, so discharged home with no follow up appointment. No visit from pharmacist on day of discharge so sent home without antibiotics (walk in centre had to then remedy this in spite of the fact it is not their responsibility).  \r\nDaughter in so much pain had to return to the A& E department at Chelsea and Westminster - however, they failed to bleep the surgical team so she went home feeling as bad as when she came.

To someone who was struggling to survive my environment and symptoms, this was a big blow to my mental health, i spiralled downwards and couldn't face going through the entire process again.\n\nMore recently I've been trying to enquire about a bipolar diagnosis, and i was referred to think wellbeing halton again. The person i spoke with initially was lovely, we did an hour long triage session and although we talked about things that were hard to discuss, they were understanding and supportive. \n\nThe next step in the process was a phone appointment. I was rang about 40 minutes late, and unfortunately i hadn't slept in 30 hours due to ptsd/insomnia. i explained the situation and said i can't discuss heavy things because im so tired i cant think straight, is it possible to get a call back the next day. I was told no it wasn't possible, and once again i was removed from the service. I rang back a few days later to try and rebook, but i was told i'm going to have to once again start from scratch, including another hour long triage call to discuss the same traumatic things that i'd already discussed just a few days before. The thought made me feel ill, so i cancelled the new triage appointment.\n\nTwice now I've felt abandoned by the service, and being cut off so quickly brought up a lot of past abandonment trauma. Some of the people are nice but they also seem to be unapologetic about removing vulnerable people from the service. I was borderline suicidal the first time I got in touch, i said i wasn't because admitting it can get you put in hospital, but i was still counting on this therapy service to survive. I recovered on my own after a failed attempt, i just wish i could have gotten the therapy I needed before hand.\n\nI'm upset because it can be hard to keep appointments and follow instructions with bad mental health problems, and vulnerable people need to be supported and understood rather than cut loose and sent back to square 1. If you're in a bad place its hard enough to seek help in the first place, having to pass these additional roadblocks can have devastating consequences to vulnerable and suffering people. I understand that we don't live in an ideal world and resources are limited, but a bit of support and understanding could well save lives.\n\nPlease bear in mind this isn't a review of the actual therapy, it might well be great, i just needed to let someone know the minor issues i've faced with this service have had some major impacts on me. The feelings of abandonment have put me off the entire service,and i doubt i'll try them again now.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-11-20T11:40:24","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2020-11-20T11:43:45","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/804891","id":"804891"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/804891/responses","id":"804891"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/804891/healthservices","id":"804891"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/804891/tags","id":"804891"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/ry2x3","id":"RY2X3","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/abandoned","id":"abandoned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/traumatic","id":"traumatic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20upset","id":"very upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bipolar","id":"bipolar"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/borderline","id":"Borderline"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diagnosis","id":"diagnosis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/face","id":"face"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hand","id":"hand"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/insomnia","id":"insomnia"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ptsd","id":"ptsd"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/suicidal","id":"suicidal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/triage","id":"triage"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vulnerable","id":"vulnerable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported","id":"supported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wellbeing","id":"wellbeing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tired","id":"tired"}]},{"id":804888,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Fantastic Practice ","body":"I have been a patient of this practice for years. My parents were too. Doctors nurses health care assistants all staff work has a team.  I recently had some stitches removed and the safety for patients and staff during the pandemic is exceptional.  At the moment we use online triage that is done through the website or patient access . It is easy to do and you are contacted within two days. In my experience it’s been the same day and have had a telephone consultation. If people have no internet or can not use the computer or the elderly you can still ring the practice. My online triage experience has been excellent. I have been very ill due to Covid and other health problems. I can honestly say the care and support I have had from all staff is outstanding.  Reception staff are helpful and caring when they ring you. During these difficult times I can honestly say I am lucky to have a fantastic practice that work as a team and I have found the online triage helpful because phone lines can be busy and if you need to speak or see a doctor the online triage works well.  You Are notified of a call back by text  and if the g p feels you need to be seen then they can arrange a safe face to face appointment using strict safety guidelines.\nThis practice is a team and that makes a huge difference .  The phone lines can be very busy but I know they are looking into putting in a new system .

They never sound like they actually care about you and consistently try to get you off the phone as soon as possible whether you get the help you need or not. They will have you on hold for longer than half an hour with no apology or anything  you’d think during coronavirus they would be more caring but no. Management definitely know of this problem there are several complaints of the same thing on Google reviews of the practise and they give the same typical replies to it such as “this is not our standards” and “we will be talking to staff” but that’s as unhelpful as the responses the receptionists give with no real action plan on how they are going to improve - not hard to see where they get it from.\n\nThe service you get from the doctors is fantastic and second to none, always willing to help and listen to you. It’s just a shame this will always be overlooked by the receptionists.\n\nSeriously whoever is in management at this practise If you read this review please put a action plan to how receptionists should speak and deal with customers because I don’t want to hear a general copy and paste reply. In fact, why don’t you test call them yourself to see the service you’d get as a patient and I guarantee you’d even shock yourself. They sound so unbothered and have a consistent tone of voice that says ‘why are you calling me?’. If you don’t believe me or think it’s a one off check the reviews of the practise on Google. This is the last chance I’m giving this practise before I leave for good.\n\nAs mentioned, if you manage to past through the war over the phone with the receptionists, doctors are awesome. Nurses are really great too.

However it is a real shame the local midwife resources have been removed from our village and I had to drive 40 minutes for each appointment. I imagine it would be difficult for first time mums to have fewer appointments and could feel less supported, and for those who rely on public transport as it is sparse in our area and an appointment could end up taking a whole day. I called the labour ward on the day when things started and received good support in making my own decision over the phone with regards to when to go in vs staying at home. I felt supported and reassured at that point. Although I wasn't sure about current Covid-related guidelines and had to ask, it would have been good to have been informed at that point about the current rules for masks, partners etc. I had been told the most up to date information at my last antenatal appointment, but things change so fast I wasn't sure it would be the same.When we went in we were welcomed and made to feel comfortable. I felt listened to, not judged or made to feel silly at all about any of my thoughts or preferences about labour or birth. I had a quick labour and gave birth within about 50 min of arriving. I was asked how I was doing at intervals in an open and unobtrusive manner, and felt I could ask for what I needed when I needed it. I'm not sure the midwife believed me when I said I felt I was progressing and the baby was coming, but she reacted quickly and appropriately when it came! A student nurse was also present throughout. Her presence was great, she was lovely, seemed keen to learn and in no way detracted from the experience.After the birth we had plenty of time to be alone in the room with our new baby, for skin to skin, feeding and just being together. As the baby and I were both fine this was straight after the birth, the assessments and sutures were left a little while. My partner also got time for skin to skin while I showered. This was really special and probably the highlight of the experience for us both. We then went to the ward, as it was late and we live a good distance from the hospital we were given a side room and they had made a bed up for my partner, which was really appreciated and made all the difference.It is worth mentioning I also gave birth to my first child at BGH in 2018. The experience then was also fantastic. The midwife when I was in labour was great, supportive and respectful. She was particularly confident (in an entirely appropriate, understated way) in what to do/not to do for me. I didn't need to ask for anything, she seemed to anticipate what I needed. I basically tried to replicate the atmosphere she created for my second birth! Later however, my partner had had to leave, late at night after being awake for over 40 hours and through a stressful and emotional experience, to drive over an hour home. This spoiled the experience then a bit as it was actually dangerous and he had to stop to sleep at the side of the road on the way. I stayed overnight the first time, rather than going home as early as I could have. I felt this made a huge difference as I could ask all the simple things I didn't know as a first time mum such as how to change a nappy, bath the baby, check the baby was latched on etc. Little things that could have caused a fair amount of stress if I was at home without that extra support initially. It was just a shame my partner wasn't given any consideration.  \r\nBoth experiences have been great overall. In particular, what makes it is that the staff have been friendly, helpful and respectful, at all hours.

I spoke to an eye specialist who declared that my vision was fine but there was fluid behind the eye.  \r\n  \r\nThey sent me to the medical department to see a doctor. After a 6-7 hour wait I decided I wanted to go home and told the receptionist I wanted to discharge my self.  \r\nInstantly a doctor arrived and said that I have pressure on my brain which required a lumbar puncture. After another 1-2 hour wait I was told I would be staying over night and transferred to the S.A.U. At this point no one told me what was going on and how long I was going to be there for. 5-6 days later I’m still in the hospital and still with no more information, no doctor had come to see at any point to keep me informed as to what was going on. I was going to the nurse station at least twice a day to get some answers but nothing! At this point I was getting very upset and frustrated and wanted to go home, to which I started packing my bags and walked out, for a nurse to then chase me and say the doctor is here now.  \r\nI seen the doctor and he told me what I already knew and decided to discharge my self. I honestly can’t believe it takes some one to walk out the hospital to actually get seen.

During the April bank holiday I began to experience light bleeding and acute pain in my lower abdomen, my partner suggested I contacted my GP. At this point my GP would not see any patients face to face so I had a telephone appointment. My GP expressed concern about the symptoms I was experiencing and advised me to present at Liverpool Womens Hospital A&E immediately. Fortunately I had a friend to drive me there. I felt frightened, vulnerable and upset, I could not stop crying. On arrival at the Women's Hospital I had to approach alone ,with my friend parking a 5 mins walk away from the entrance. I was confronted by a security officer who told me I could not go into the hospital and loudly asked me why are you here anyway. I explained I had been sent under the guidance of GP, crying, I read a small note on the hospital door saying A&E was appointment only with a phone number attached. I immediately began to ring this number which continued to ring out. After 5 minutes of the phone ringing out, I was still standing outside and still very emotional, I asked the security guard to assist me, they told me to cheer up and smile. Eventually they agreed to let me present at the main reception. Again at reception I was confronted by 2 more security officers; luckily a nurse saw how upset I was and offered to help me. I explained my situation to them and although they showed me kindness the fact I had to disclose this in the main foyer was less than comfortable. The nurse phoned through to the a&e team.Within a minute a nurse presented to me, they were covered in PPE so I could hardly make out what they were saying and when I asked them to repeat what they had said they shouted across the foyer “why have you turned up here?” I was clearly emotional. I explained my GP had sent me and the nurse replied (again in the foyer) “Thats not true its a bank holiday, no GP is open, so why are you here” I then had to explain in the main foyer my situation and she said “you shouldn’t be here” it was only when I asked what else I was meant to do the nurse told me to follow them. I was then placed in a side room and left alone for 10 minutes. After then the same nurse returned and abruptly asked me for my name which they wrote on a scrap of paper. Nothing else said I was again left alone for 5-10mins. On their return the accused me of not being in the system. I confirmed my details and it transpired the nurse had written my name incorrectly. Again I was left alone for a longer period this time and during which another nurse entered the room, ignoring me and took something from a cupboard. When the nurse returned they abruptly asked me to explain my symptoms/issue . I was an emotional wreck at this point but summoned the assertiveness to bring to the nurses attention that I was feeling vulnerable, and that they had not even introduced them self or explained anything to me in the time I’d been there. The nurse seemed taken a back but I did try to generalize this by saying the “pandemic is causing a lot of stress to nurses who should be at home” As I waited to see the doctor I requested a tissue and some water, with so much emotion I had none left. The nurse agreed but did not bring this to me.I eventually saw a doctor who was professional, helpful and empathic and dealt with my matter.I understand that the pandemic is causing all kinds of new stresses and challenges for both individuals and organizations. However I am so disappointed and disgusted at how this front line and nursing staff acted towards me as a clearly upset, vulnerable women alone at hospital. It really isn’t acceptable.It has taken me a long time to write this account but of course I never forget it.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-11-18T21:42:30.09","progress":"Made change","dateOfPublication":"2020-11-20T15:17:34.457","readBy":[{"name":"BPP University, School of Nursing","count":1},{"name":"Liverpool Women's NHS Foundation Trust","count":1},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2021)","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/804404","id":"804404"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/804404/responses","id":"804404"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/804404/healthservices","id":"804404"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/804404/tags","id":"804404"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rep01_501","id":"REP01_501","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disappointed","id":"disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disgusted","id":"disgusted"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frightened","id":"frightened"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stress","id":"stress"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20upset","id":"very upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/abdomen","id":"abdomen"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/alone","id":"alone"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bleeding","id":"bleeding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctor","id":"doctor"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/empathy","id":"empathy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pregnancy","id":"pregnancy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pregnant","id":"pregnant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professional","id":"professional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/respect","id":"respect"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attitude","id":"staff attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unprofessional","id":"unprofessional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vulnerable","id":"vulnerable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/women's","id":"women's"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dignity","id":"Dignity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20disappointed","id":"very disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/considered","id":"considered"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pandemic","id":"pandemic"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/807336","id":"807336"}]},{"id":804406,"author":"What is wrong","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Outpatient appointment","body":"Turned up in mid November 2020 for a dexta scan in the morning 20 minutes before my appointment time.

Angie, Steve and the nurse talked me through the whole process and tried to keep me distracted and made sure I was comfortable throughout.

I started explaining my phobia (and instantly got very emotional), and she listened to me and instantly made me feel relaxed by telling me that her son was the same and I wasn't the first nor would I be the last to come in with a phobia of needles. She took her time, reassuring me constantly that it would be okay. She explained what she was doing, but with such a gentle and caring attitude.  \r\n[Very happy with 'Staff skills']  \r\n  \r\nI didn't get her name, but I hope she sees this and knows how much I appreciate everything she did for me.
