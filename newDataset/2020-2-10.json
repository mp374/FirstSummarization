I was feeling very vulnerable and distressed and didn't know quite what to expect. I spent just over three weeks on the ward before returning home.  \r\nThere is no doubt that the priority was my personal safety, making sure that I was given the time and space to allow me to recover enough to return home and that was certainly achieved. I was lucky to have my own room and toilet/ washing facilities, along with a communal lounge. I was thoroughly checked over by a doctor and nurse on my arrival and it was made clear that all the staff were there to provide support.  \r\nUnfortunately this was not the case. Arriving on a ward like this was distressing, with very little information about what was happening, what was expected of me and I felt I had very little control over my life. When I was distressed, some staff were fantastic, supportive, ready to listen and proactive. However, many of the staff seemed to be either distracted by those patients with greater needs or simply disinterested in the patients, particularly in the evenings.  \r\nI had to ask for my care plan to be completed, and this felt like a copy and paste exercise from other patients' plans and included numerous errors. I raised this twice with the nurse but it seems I was expected to try and catch them to identify the errors, rather than this being their responsibility. I received this plan a week before I was discharged due to 'an issue with the printer in the office'. Only later on, relying on the support of my family and friends, did I feel sufficiently able to voice my concerns, but many of the actions requested by the consultant in the ward rounds were not followed through. For example, I had stated that I found it helpful to have 1:1 conversations as talking therapy, following the support I had received from my local crisis team (who were fantastic). The doctor requested that every day I have a 20 minute 'slot' for discussion with any member of staff. This did not happen once in all the time I was there.  \r\nBags were not thoroughly checked and I have no doubt that I could have further harmed myself had I decided to do so. I admit I did at times take in my own painkillers to help me manage pain and this was not noticed by the staff. Being awoken by a light every two hours as part of safety checks led to my first migraines in over a year. I asked for this to stop but unless I placed a note outside my room, this practice continued. These are just a few examples of numerous concerns and issues with my care.  \r\nThose of us who feel vulnerable are often withdrawn and unable to ask for help. Being placed in an environment that was unstructured, disorganised and at times felt uncaring made me feel angry and frustrated. I felt that because I was quiet and slept, little effort was made to engage with me or support me, and the quality of support I received depended very much on who I was dealing with.  \r\nKeeping someone safe involves more than leaving them to sleep quietly in a risk assessed environment, monitoring and managing things purely from a pharmaceutical perspective. There was little treatment on offer that differed from strategies I was already trying and I felt no attempt to work towards a discharge other than a reliance on my own determination to get out as quickly as possible. My appointment with the psychologist was due to take place on the day of my discharge.  \r\nI hope that things improve very soon for the lovely people who are left on the ward and am grateful to the few good staff who helped make my stay more bearable. In my feedback, I've asked if I can speak to the hospital about my care.","criticality":"strongly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-01-28T17:09:33.4733333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-02-10T09:20:00.987","readBy":[{"name":"Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust","count":17},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2020)","count":1},{"name":"Plymouth University BSc Mental Health 2019-09","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/734563","id":"734563"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/734563/responses","id":"734563"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/734563/healthservices","id":"734563"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/734563/tags","id":"734563"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/ntn","id":"NTN","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rha_710","id":"RHA_710","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/angry","id":"angry"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/crisis","id":"crisis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/distressing","id":"distressing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ignored","id":"ignored"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/should%20listen","id":"Should listen"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/uncaring","id":"uncaring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20frustrated","id":"very frustrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care%20plan","id":"care plan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disorganised","id":"disorganised"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/distressed","id":"distressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/engagement","id":"engagement"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/environment","id":"environment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/follow%20up","id":"follow up"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/information","id":"information"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/organisation","id":"organisation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/patient-centred","id":"patient-centred"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sleep","id":"sleep"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/some%20staff","id":"some staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vulnerable","id":"vulnerable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/side%20room","id":"Side room"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/access%20to%20support","id":"access to support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/private%20facilities","id":"private facilities"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disengaged%20staff","id":"disengaged staff"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/740673","id":"740673"}]},{"id":738845,"author":"The old lock keeper","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"No Gp appointments","body":"I have been trying to get an appointment to see a GP since before Christmas!

To get an appointment I am forced to receive a call from Triage and then they decide if I see a doctor. Waste of time and resources.

My previous GP here left ( I wasn’t told) and I’m allocated another Doctor without my knowledge. I find that unacceptable. Getting an appointment is virtually impossible unless you wait 2 weeks or more. I’ve also been told by reception that a group of appointments ‘ have not been released yet’ and awaiting permission from Practice Manager to do so. Have been asked what my symptoms are by a receptionist , who didn’t like my reply of ‘ not your business unless your medically qualified’. Not been asked since . Shambolic at times with the Dentist shouting patients names, whilst some Doctors barely raise a whisper when calling your name. Last visit a screaming child drowned out everything and went on for 20 minutes . My appointment was almost an hour late and I only got relief from the screaming child when I was finally seen . Yet I have been late arriving on just one occasion by 10 minutes due to traffic and received a lecture from reception. Came out to the child still screaming ( he had been prevented from running riot by his mother) various frowns from reception but nothing actually said . All in all it’s gone from having a system that worked pretty well ( phone at 8 for an appointment) to one that does not work well, by having to go through triage. Even then I was only given an appointment with practitioner nurse , who although nice, had limited capabilities in dealing with my problem, resulting in my having to visit the surgery again today to see the doctor ","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-02-10T07:12:19","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-02-10T09:31:11","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/740627","id":"740627"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/740627/responses","id":"740627"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/740627/healthservices","id":"740627"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/740627/tags","id":"740627"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/j81042","id":"J81042","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/deaf","id":"deaf"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/face","id":"face"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/group","id":"group"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/triage","id":"triage"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/785340","id":"785340"}]},{"id":740626,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Circus","body":"None of the doctors seem to have an interest in communicating with each other to help patients, infact the three doctors don't even seem to like each other and often show obvious signs of disharmony between them resulting in a disservice to their patients.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-02-10T07:25:03","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-02-10T09:31:43","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/740626","id":"740626"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/740626/responses","id":"740626"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/740626/healthservices","id":"740626"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/740626/tags","id":"740626"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/b86654","id":"B86654","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/signs","id":"signs"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/740913","id":"740913"}]},{"id":740628,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Incredibly quick ","body":"We had to go to urgent care in Tiverton after our friend cut his hand.

I do this without malice simply to reassure those with similar issues, out there, they are not alone. This is not a witch hunt, so I won't mention any names.  \r\nI had been seeing a CPN at Stonebridge for over six months. Following a series of demeaning meetings and what I would call inaccuracies in the subsequent correspondences to my GP, decided, (with a heavy heart) that I did not wish to see this person anymore. This was about the end of October 2019 and was established with the service manager.  \r\nAfter this time my mental health took a very big downturn and I managed to get to see the current locum psychiatrist. They assessed my current mental well-being and remarked that I was now at risk . This was of no surprise to me considering the fact that I had started to hear voices in my head and just prior to the appointment had been jumping in front of traffic, begging drivers to run me over.  \r\nI was prescribed anti psychotics and promised an appointment early in the new year.  \r\nWell to any readers out there you won't be surprised to hear that never happened. Iam having problems with the new medication and have talked to my GP about it, but it's beyond his realm of expertise.  \r\nWhat really upsets me though is receiving an appointment from the CPN I said I found too difficult to work with, in the New Year. I think, after all ive been through they've not listened to a word I have said. I cancelled this, quite rightly, as far as I'm concerned this was a wrongly deployed, 'null appointment'.  \r\nI received a letter yesterday saying I was about to be discharged in light of the fact that I cancelled the appointment with the original CPN. There was no mention of a psychiatrist appointment or alternatives to the CPN I broke ties with last October. I have been under the Stonebridge for well over 10 years, never known it so bad especially when as the psychiatrist said before Christmas -you are now at risk","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-02-07T22:09:06.6133333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-02-10T10:38:08.31","readBy":[{"name":"Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust","count":14},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2020)","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/740374","id":"740374"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/740374/responses","id":"740374"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/740374/healthservices","id":"740374"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/740374/tags","id":"740374"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rha-amh-city","id":"rha-amh-city","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20listened%20to","id":"not listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/alone","id":"alone"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/discharged%20from%20care","id":"discharged from care"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/742710","id":"742710"}]},{"id":740345,"author":"KL-93","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"The staff were really reassuring","body":"Newborn son had lump appear on his head.

I said I’d prefer to see GP please, she then proceeded to launch into how the nurse was a highly trained professional can prescribe etc. I asked again to see a GP and was then met with a very very curt, ‘well I need to write on the computer why you won’t see the nurse so can you tell me why. The Doctor will want to know why you won’t see them’. I just replied that I will discuss it  with the GP when I go. I was Eventually  given an appointment but she remained very brusque and put the phone down! I know first hand how tightly squeezed NHS services are, it’s a battle one deals with everyday as a Health professional myself. The reasons for wanting to see a GP ? Well I shouldn’t have to justify that here but let’s just say, there may be more to a patient’s presentation than whether they need medication thrown at them. I know with my background, that I need to discuss my symptoms with a Doctor who has already referred me to Hospital. Even with my almost 40 years of clinical experience, I was left feeling very upset, demoralised and like a scalded child just for asking to see a Doctor. As I said, I fully understand the pressures of demand v capacity, and the direction which these staff may have been given by practice management teams, but these people in the main are not  trained in triage nor have clinical backgrounds and a patient, who is already feeling unwell enough to reach out, should not be made to feel this way. Sorry but from posts here too, this practice failing in at least 2 of the CQC 5 KLOe: Caring and Responsive. Thankfully the only saving grace is that when you do see a GP, they are very good but that cannot be said for the way in which this practice is managed not for the way in which patients are made to feel on contact.

The general atmosphere was efficient but friendly, which gave me confidence that I would be treated well and thoroughly. The staff were all excellent, including doctors, nurses, HCAs, cleaners, therapists and everyone else too. All the necessary investigations were done and I wasn't sent home until the physiotherapist was assured that I could walk and manage the stairs, and the occupational therapist had tested me making a drink. This gave me confidence that I was safe to be discharged. The food was delicious and plentiful in the time I was there, and the staff found the time to interact with the patients. I would particularly mention the HCA called Janet. Nothing was too much trouble for her, from helping me to the bathroom to getting answers to my questions and she walked miles escorting me to and from my scans.

Before her admission, she had been socially active and a regular attender at local groups and family events, although deafness and slowly declining mobility sometimes made life challenging for her.  \r\nShe was admitted via Accident and Emergency into a medical assessment ward in January (probably the worst time of year to be admitted I feel, when acute services are under maximum pressure), then had several ward moves during her short admission. After a few days, she was medically fit for discharge, but remained a shadow of her former self. At discharge, she was referred to the Wishaw Rehabilitation Team under the 'Discharge to Assess' programme.  \r\nWithin two hours of discharge, she was assessed by an Occupational Therapist who gave us lots of helpful advice, always based on my mother's own wishes and needs. She then very rapidly organised personal home care services to help with washing and dressing in the morning and evening, hand rails to enable my mum to access her bedroom and bathroom upstairs, walking aids for both upstairs and downstairs, toilet adaptations, a key box, community alarm and inputs from wider team members, including a physiotherapist, the sensory care team and the local fire service.  \r\nThis story is about the excellent person centred care delivered by this team, which is an example of the type of high quality rehabilitation services that enable people who are at high risk of being readmitted to hospital to remain in their own home.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-02-09T17:19:07.3233333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-02-10T11:49:27.367","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lanarkshire","count":15},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":1},{"name":"North Lanarkshire Health & Social Care Partnership","count":2},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2020)","count":1},{"name":"Partnership for Change","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/740579","id":"740579"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/740579/responses","id":"740579"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/740579/healthservices","id":"740579"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/740579/tags","id":"740579"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sl9-occupational-therapy","id":"SL9-occupational-therapy","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sl9-physiotherapy","id":"SL9-physiotherapy","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency","id":"emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/empathy","id":"empathy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/individualised%20care","id":"individualised care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mobility","id":"mobility"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/organised","id":"organised"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pneumonia","id":"pneumonia"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/practical%20help","id":"practical help"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/proud","id":"proud"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/rehabilitation","id":"rehabilitation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/impressed","id":"impressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/relieved","id":"relieved"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/person%20centred%20care","id":"Person centred care"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/740671","id":"740671"}]},{"id":739987,"author":"Heart","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Heart attack","body":"One evening in September 2019 I felt a pain in my chest, pressure and tightening. I also felt pain in my back, down my left arm and in my jawline. My forehead was clammy and cold to the touch. I had no idea what was happening but I knew it was not right to feel this way. I telephoned NHS 24 and the call handler relayed the information to a nurse who decided to send an ambulance for me.  \r\nThe ambulance arrived some time later and the paramedics sprayed the GTN spray under my tongue and gave me an aspirin to chew. They carried out an ECG in my bedroom before taking me to Wishaw General Hospital. When I arrived in A&E I underwent various tests and procedures; one of which was a TROP(Troponin?) Test to assess the level in my blood. This test was repeated after 5/6 hours and the doctor reported t me that because there had been a 40% difference in the two readings I had had a heart attack!  \r\nI was transferred to the Emergency Care Ward to be monitored and was again informed that I had had a heart attack. I was then moved to the Respiratory Ward on Monday under a consultant. I underwent other tests/scans etc and each doctor I saw told me I had had a heart attack. I did not see the consultant until Wednesday afternoon when I was told that I had not had a heart attack. I was delighted at the news but queried why several other doctors had told me that I had had a heart attack. The doctor appeared perplexed and bewildered as to why I would be told such a thing! The doctor then said that on paper I had had a heart attack; but that they weren't convinced\"!!! The doctor then arranged for me to have a test for a Pulmonary Embolism. As this doctor was then off duty it was one of the other doctors who told me on Thursday morning that the test for a clot had come back negative so they were going to be treating me for the heart - no mention of a heart attack this time! I was to have a treadmill test but it was broken and it would not be repaired until at least the following Thursday. The doctor asked if I would stay in hospital for a week until the treadmill was fixed; believing that the test would have been done quicker with me as an in patient. However I requested to be allowed to go home and after taking some advice the doctor agreed. The was at the end of September 2019.  \r\nI received a letter from the hospital inviting me to attend for a treadmill test on in early October. On the morning of the appointment I received a telephone call to tell me that due to sickness absence within the department my appointment was postponed and I would receive another in the near future.  \r\nTwo days later in the evening of Wednesday I experienced the same symptoms that I had when I was first admitted. I telephoned NHS 24 and they sent an emergency ambulance for me. When I arrived in A&E the doctor enquired why I had not used my GTN spray and I said I didn't have one. The doctor said that I should never have been dismissed in September without a spray. I explained what was happening and what had happened previously and that I had been told there was no changes in any ECG's and nothing unusual. The doctor came back to tell me I was being admitted to ECU and said that my previous ECG did show something in my upper ??? and lower ??? were ??? - and that they just thought I might want to know that! Another consultant arranged for me to have a treadmill test which I could not do and therefore there was not a definitive reading. I was then moved to the Coronary Ward.  \r\nOnce in the Coronary Ward I realised that I was across the corridor from someone I knew - this was not acceptable under the circumstances. The consultant who would be assessing my case but be was otherwise engaged asked another consultant to see me and assess if I needed to stay in hospital. The consultant provided me with a very comprehensive and detailed description of indigestion and heartburn and suggested that my medication was now - after years - affecting my stomach and that he would change my prescription and add an indigestion tablet to help my indigestion and sent me home the day after I was admitted.  \r\nI received a letter to go for a CT Angiogram in December at the Golden Jubilee Hospital. I attended the appointment and the result is that I have Coronary Artery Disease; the doctor at the Jubilee, Scotland's National Hospital, said that if I was their patient they would be arranging for a balloon and a stent to be inserted. The report was forwarded to University Hospital Wishaw General and it has been decided that I do not require any angioplasty at this time and I have been invited to a clinic in March 2020.  \r\nI believe that time is of the essence and it is unacceptable that different health professionals have different opinions and because of this I feel am at the mercy of whatever comes into their mind that day. It strikes me as an abuse of power and is morally unacceptable.  \r\nPlease investigate. I look forward to your response.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-02-07T00:40:56.83","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-02-10T11:50:37.803","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lanarkshire","count":6},{"name":"Golden Jubilee National Hospital","count":3},{"name":"Scottish Government","count":3},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":1},{"name":"Partnership for Change","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/739987","id":"739987"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/739987/responses","id":"739987"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/739987/healthservices","id":"739987"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/739987/tags","id":"739987"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/d102h_172","id":"D102H_172","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l308h_320","id":"L308H_320","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l308h_340","id":"L308H_340","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l308h-emec","id":"l308h-emec","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxious","id":"anxious"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/a&e%20staff","id":"A&E staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/afraid","id":"afraid"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/angiogram","id":"Angiogram"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/arm","id":"arm"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back%20pain","id":"back pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bewildered","id":"bewildered"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20test","id":"blood test"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/chest%20pain","id":"chest pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/coronary%20artery","id":"coronary artery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/decision%20making","id":"decision making"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dismissed","id":"dismissed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ecg","id":"ecg"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/heart%20attack","id":"heart attack"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/heartburn","id":"heartburn"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hospital%20care","id":"hospital care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/indigestion","id":"indigestion"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/perplexed","id":"Perplexed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pulmonary%20embolism","id":"pulmonary embolism"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/respiratory","id":"respiratory"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stomach","id":"stomach"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20disappointed","id":"very disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ambulance%20staff","id":"ambulance staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/no%20confidence","id":"no confidence"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/740712","id":"740712"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/741906","id":"741906"}]},{"id":740372,"author":"Anw-20","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"My stay on Castle Ward","body":"Approximately one year ago I was a patient on Castle Ward Worthing Hospital.  \r\nIt has taken all this time to feel mentally able to write this review.  \r\nThe doctor at A&E was very good but my nightmare began as soon as I was taken up to Castle Ward.  \r\nI am elderly and was poorly and I feel that because of this, the staff treated me as if I was a baby or demented as if I had lost my marbles. Sometimes they would shout at me for things that I could not help like knocking things over. I often asked about my medical condition and no one would tell me which made me feel very anxious. My relatives had no joy either and were quite often kept in the dark.  \r\nQuite often I would feel very thirsty but my drink was out of reach. Everytime I asked a member of staff for it, I felt like I was being a nuisance. One day my mouth was very sore and dry and a nurse put my tablets in my mouth without a drink and they got stuck on the roof of my mouth instead of going down. This caused me even more pain. My relatives tried to complain about it but felt they were treated as a nuisance too.  \r\nThe nights were really long and also the days. I only had my visits from my relatives to look forward to and was often close to tears when they arrived. I was made to go to bed at 7pm.  \r\nThis would not seem quite so bad if the staff seemed like they were too busy, but I quite often observed them chatting together which included talking about \"nuisance patients and relatives\" which I could hear every word. They also talked about other staff members.  \r\nI was so relieved to be discharged home even though I still felt poorly. I have instructed my family to make certain that I never go to that particular hospital again.  \r\nIf you have an elderly relative keep them away from Castle Ward.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-02-07T21:32:59.46","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-02-10T11:53:48.497","readBy":[{"name":"Western Sussex Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust","count":2},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2020)","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/740372","id":"740372"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/740372/responses","id":"740372"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/740372/healthservices","id":"740372"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/740372/tags","id":"740372"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/ryr18_430","id":"RYR18_430","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxious","id":"anxious"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nuisance","id":"nuisance"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/belittled","id":"belittled"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/delirium","id":"delirium"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/elderly","id":"elderly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/information","id":"information"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lonely","id":"lonely"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attitude","id":"staff attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/family%20kept%20informed","id":"family kept informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/new%20staff%20team","id":"new staff team"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/like%20a%20nobody","id":"like a nobody"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/a&e%20doctor","id":"a&e doctor"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/740706","id":"740706"}]},{"id":740670,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"I was given unclear instructions.","body":"During my appointment for my echocardiogram, I first asked for my mum to leave the room but instead the staff member took it upon themselves to just draw a curtain even though when I inevitably had to walk out from the curtain my mum would see me.

I said is there no way I can keep it on and they said no because the gel needs to be rubbed on the heart area and they pointed to where that was on themselves and it would be right under the nipple so this to me as an insecure 17 year old girl rang massive alarm bells so I refused the whole thing. I wanted to wear a gown not a cape that would reveal and show everything, the staff member said it’s the least invasive test but the cape only covered my back whilst my whole chest would have been exposed and if it was supposed to cover my front then there would have been no way that they could have rubbed the gel on. This was all very confusing for me and I wish I was given some clear instructions. Afterwards they attempted to guilt trip me by saying how it’s one of the least invasive tests so they was confused why I wouldn’t cooperate but from the instructions given I was expected to walk out in front of the staff member and my mum with my boobs completely out which is something I’m not prepared to do.

I found this quite a traumatic experience, and also had no answers, and had to return home to my toddler which is a challenging situation when you have to remain lying down. &nbsp;","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-02-10T13:04:09.9133333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-02-10T13:06:49.4","readBy":[{"name":"Plymouth University BSc Adult Nursing 2020-09","count":1},{"name":"Torbay and South Devon NHS Foundation Trust","count":1},{"name":"Plymouth University Health and Human Sciences students, 2018","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/740681","id":"740681"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/740681/responses","id":"740681"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/740681/healthservices","id":"740681"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/740681/tags","id":"740681"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/ra901_180","id":"RA901_180","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/traumatic","id":"traumatic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/concerned","id":"concerned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/headaches","id":"headaches"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nausea","id":"nausea"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sickness","id":"sickness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/no%20answers","id":"no answers"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/discharged%20at%20night","id":"discharged at night"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/740991","id":"740991"}]},{"id":740682,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Good service","body":"All staff very helpful including receptionist, nurses and doctors.

After little improvement, I then returned to A&E the following weekend on the advice of 111 when I developed double vision in addition to the previous symptoms. This time I was told almost straight away after seeing the doctor in A&E that I wouldn't be leaving until they had an answer. He gave me a very thorough examination and my husband and I were so relieved to be taken seriously.  \r\nI was then introduced to a doctor named Charlotte, based on EAU3 who again gave me a thorough examination and decided to admit me to the EAU3 unit overnight so that she could oversee my care the following day. She arranged for a number of different tests to take place quickly and thoroughly and they managed to find the cause of the problem, which it turned out was a dural leak, causing hypotension in my head. I remained in EAU3 for 3 nights and over that time Charlotte made sure that I was thoroughly investigated, informed and looked after throughout. She even went out of her way on her day off the ward to come down a number of times to do a lumbar puncture and to keep me in the loop regarding my progress.  \r\nAfter a worrying week and our experience the previous weekend of feeling like we were wasting the hospital's time, both I and my family were extremely grateful to receive such comprehensive attention and care from Charlotte, and to be communicated with so considerately doing what we believe was going over and above what she was expected to do. When I left the hospital this time I felt confident that I knew what to expect moving forward and that I would be looked after if symptoms continued.  \r\nI would also like to mention Dr Baird who I also found to be both attentive, and considerate in the way he communicated with me.  \r\nI would just like to say a huge thank you in particular to Charlotte, but also to Dr Baird and to the Doctor who I met in triage that day, for putting my mind at rest, taking my symptoms seriously and for looking after me so well over the few days I was in.  \r\n[Very happy with 'Being listened to']  \r\n  \r\n[Very happy with 'Explanations']  \r\n","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-02-07T23:10:59.0466667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-02-10T13:08:00.357","readBy":[{"name":"Torbay and South Devon NHS Foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/740375","id":"740375"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/740375/responses","id":"740375"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/740375/healthservices","id":"740375"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/740375/tags","id":"740375"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/ra901_180","id":"RA901_180","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/ra901_400","id":"RA901_400","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/attentive","id":"attentive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/considerate","id":"considerate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctor","id":"doctor"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/double%20vision","id":"double vision"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/headaches","id":"headaches"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kept%20informed","id":"kept informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lumbar%20puncture","id":"lumbar puncture"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nausea","id":"nausea"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sickness","id":"sickness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thorough","id":"thorough"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/well%20looked%20after","id":"well looked after"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/relieved","id":"relieved"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/740989","id":"740989"}]},{"id":740689,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Appointments difficult","body":"Doctors excellent.\nNurses excellent.\nReception staff good.\nBut trying to phone for an appointment is hopeless.

This was first spotted by my GP who got me an appointment at Ninewells hospital. Within a short time I had an appointment with the surgeons at Ninewells. They confirmed the diagnosis and explained what treatment would be required. They were at pains to put me at ease and explain any questions I had. I received my treatment on 11 December. All of the staff on the day were terrific, things were running a little late but I was kept informed as to what was happening. The operation itself was a complete success and I later received a phone call verifying that all of the BSC had been removed.

The treatment received was top class and all the staff I came into contact with were professional and courteous. Whilst it is never good to have these operations I can only applaud the staff and treatment I received from both my GP and Ninewells Hospital.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-02-10T10:15:44.9933333","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2020-02-10T13:26:57.573","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Tayside","count":4}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/740639","id":"740639"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/740639/responses","id":"740639"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/740639/healthservices","id":"740639"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/740639/tags","id":"740639"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/t101h_330","id":"T101H_330","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/basal%20cell%20carcinoma","id":"basal cell carcinoma"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/chest","id":"chest"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/courteous","id":"courteous"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good","id":"good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/operation","id":"operation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professional","id":"professional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/speed%20of%20process","id":"speed of process"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happy","id":"happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wonderful","id":"wonderful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20ease","id":"at ease"}]},{"id":740694,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"RubbIsh","body":"Was told by healthshare that the results of my scan showed a partial tear in my plantar fascia and that I was being referred to the Nuffield for injections or surgery but when I got to the Nuffield my appointment was with a physio, which I didn't need, who couldn't access my scan as it was done by a private company and I've got to start the process all over again, phoned pals to complain and they said that healthshare should have referred me to a consultant and sent my scan over.

back nor a successful appointment to see a doctor.\nWhen they didn't contact me and after I spent an afternoon on the phone unable to get through, I visited the surgery and was told by the receptionist that the results were not good and that I would need to discuss them with a doctor.\nShe then told me that all she was able to offer was a telephone call during my work hours and in 3 weeks time; the call never came.\nThey then offered me an extended hours appointment at Bransholme Health Centre which I attended this last weekend only to be told by the doctor there that he had no access on his computer to my test results.\nThey are useless, profiteering racketeers who treat their clients with little to no concern or individuality preferring the McDonalds approach to NHS 'care'.\nAs has been stated already in another review, their reception staff leave much to be desired in terms of manners, often doing their uppermost to discourage anyone from wanting an appointment and making you all-but beg at a time when you might already be feeling low and vulnerable.\nThis isn't the first time that I or my family have been treated like this - my daughter was also treated very poorly last year, requiring 2 appointments for a routine matter that could have been dealt with in 1 appointment had the consultant done their job properly in the first

Being on the SAU for most of my stay the menu choices were severely limited to what amounted to jacket potatoes or soup or even worse cup a soups. For most of my stay I was on liquids or fluids only so only had to endure one jacket potato which was truly vile. Dry and tasteless accompanied by a pot of extremely fishy smelling tuna. The most concerning episode was after I had my procedure and was transferred to another ward. When lunch was being served as I was not there the day before I was told I would have to have what was left. I then asked for a bowl of soup as I was trying to build my diet up to liquids from free fluids. What I was actually served was mince potatoes and sweet corn. Hardly a liquid diet. My daughter took me down to the restaurant and bought me a yogurt for my lunch. For dinner I was served chicken curry. Once again not appropriate. I had some cup a soups with me so asked for someone to add some water to it for me. At no time was I offered an alternative and thank the Lord was discharged the same evening.
