I was well looked after, however it wasn’t made clear to me that this might be as disturbing an experience as I found it! Two nurses were with me, talking away, to distract me, I suppose. One of them had to hold me down though as I tried to tell them through gritted teeth, ‘I.. can’t.. take.. this.. any… more..!’. I was in shock coming out of there. It was an extreme pressured feeling - a traumatic and barbaric experience for me. I couldn’t believe I hadn’t been sedated. I don’t remember being offered anything, or warned about this before I went in. I took a couple of pain killers as advised, and that was it. I could see on the nurses faces that they knew what I was in for, and another nurse did come out to see me in the waiting room and ask if I was ok. She looked concerned and I burst into tears. I was shaking with shock.  \r\nI now live in Portugal, and on having my mirena check up, we got talking about my hysteroscopy experience. The gynocologist said that here in Portugal, women are always sedated for an hysteroscopy and suggested reasons why the NHS don't always do it. It has always bothered me that other women are going in for the same treatment and may have a similar or worse experience. I would like to see a change in the system so that everyone is sedated. There’s just no way of knowing if you can take the pain or not before you go in, in my experience, and it is not worth taking the risk.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-09-22T17:37:36.43","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-09-25T09:20:00.54","readBy":[{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2020)","count":1},{"name":"Birmingham Women's and Children's NHS Foundation Trust","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/788322","id":"788322"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/788322/responses","id":"788322"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/788322/healthservices","id":"788322"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/788322/tags","id":"788322"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rq370_502","id":"RQ370_502","score":2},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/shocked","id":"shocked"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/access%20to%20pain%20relief","id":"access to pain relief"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hysteroscopy","id":"hysteroscopy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/in%20pain","id":"in pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/information","id":"information"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/periods","id":"periods"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/traumatised","id":"traumatised"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/well%20looked%20after","id":"well looked after"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/792396","id":"792396"}]},{"id":788813,"author":"blackbirdej89","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"My Wife's appointment at ENT","body":"My wife attended the doctor at the beginning of the year regarding issues with her ears and a build up of wax. The GP said that they no longer perform procedures such as ear syringing at the surgery and that my wife would need to attend the ENT department at the hospital. We received an appointment for March this year but due to covid-19 this had to be cancelled and they couldn't tell us a time frame of when she would now be seen.  \r\nWe received an appointment finally for today, so i took my wife along to her appointment, ensuring to follow all the new covid guidelines of waiting in the car park etc. when we finally saw the nurse, my wife was informed that her procedure could not go ahead today as planned as the wax in her ears was too hard. The nurse said that she should have been using drops to soften this prior to attending the appointment today, but this had not been communicated to us prior to the appointment. Nor was it mentioned on the appointment letter. Had we known about it we would have applied drops. No prescription was given.  \r\nThis is upsetting as my wife has waited 13 months (since she first went to the doctors) to receive treatment for her wax build up. I am not happy that nothing was communicated to us prior to the appointment and because it is now having a knock on effect on other appointments my wife is required to attend with audiology to fit her hearing aid at the beginning of October. These appointments cant go ahead until the wax is gone. This is causing great distress because the nurse today told her that it could take up to 3 months to remove the wax and get another appointment. so she could be waiting months. We had been told at a previous appointment that the method for removing wax from ears could be done despite the wax being hard but that was not the case today. Poor communication and conflicting advice has led to upset and distress , along with the worry as to when she will be seen again.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-09-23T13:52:29.9833333","progress":"Change planned","dateOfPublication":"2020-09-25T09:33:01.74","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Ayrshire & Arran","count":9},{"name":"St. Andrews University ScotGEM Medical Students","count":1},{"name":"Scottish Government","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/788813","id":"788813"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/788813/responses","id":"788813"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/788813/healthservices","id":"788813"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/788813/tags","id":"788813"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/a111h_120","id":"A111H_120","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/angry","id":"angry"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20upset","id":"very upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/worried","id":"worried"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/audiology","id":"audiology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/distressed","id":"distressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ear","id":"ear"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ear%20syringing","id":"Ear syringing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ears","id":"ears"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ent","id":"ent"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/get%20fit","id":"get fit"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hearing","id":"hearing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hearing%20aid","id":"hearing aid"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting%20times","id":"waiting times"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wax","id":"wax"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happy","id":"happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/conflicting%20advice","id":"conflicting advice"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/misinformation","id":"misinformation"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/792817","id":"792817"}]},{"id":788815,"author":"Sincere Thanks","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Surgery to remove benign ovarian cyst","body":"The team works!

Being a single parent to two children I found it extremely difficult getting my children picked up from school so had could not attend a few sessions. Subsequently I was asked to leave group as the policy is if u miss 3 or more sessions you have to leave.  \r\nI was slightly disheartened as felt the service was not being inclusive for parents who have to do school run. My psychiatrist then suggested I look at the recovery college and enrol on some classes there. Having looked through the time table the same problem has come up, with most of the classes between 2-4pm. I do not feel this is person centred- as surely there is other parents in the same situation as me, with limited childcare or support and living with mental health problems.  \r\nI hope West London Mental health services can look into this, and try to accommodate everyone who wishes to use their services!","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-09-23T15:39:53.3533333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-09-25T10:08:41.89","readBy":[{"name":"West London NHS Trust","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/788854","id":"788854"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/788854/responses","id":"788854"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/788854/healthservices","id":"788854"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/788854/tags","id":"788854"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rkl78-treatment-and-recovery-team","id":"RKL78-treatment-and-recovery-team","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/access%20to%20mental%20health%20services","id":"access to mental health services"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disheartened","id":"disheartened"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/group","id":"group"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/person-centred","id":"person-centred"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/inclusivity","id":"inclusivity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/no%20hope","id":"no hope"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/790449","id":"790449"}]},{"id":788865,"author":"slappa tray","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Mental health","body":"I intended commit suicide 2018 and the ambulance was absolutely great, the physiatrist was good but only saw er for a year then ad no help until July 2020 and the crisis team was absolutely brilliant and really listened and supported me all time, helped me off my medication as was not helping making me worse, glad I've got there support&nbsp;","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-09-23T16:09:36.1633333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-09-25T10:13:52.903","readBy":[{"name":"Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust","count":23},{"name":"Kings medical students, 2020","count":1},{"name":"East Midlands Ambulance Service","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/788865","id":"788865"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/788865/responses","id":"788865"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/788865/healthservices","id":"788865"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/788865/tags","id":"788865"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rhabw","id":"RHABW","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rha-crisis-midnotts","id":"rha-crisis-midnotts","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rx9-emergency","id":"RX9-emergency","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/brilliant","id":"brilliant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/crisis%20team","id":"Crisis Team"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/help","id":"help"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/paramedics","id":"paramedics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/psychiatrist","id":"psychiatrist"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/suicide","id":"suicide"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported","id":"supported"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/789352","id":"789352"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/811157","id":"811157"}]},{"id":788872,"author":"KelJ","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Hydrotherapy","body":"I have a long term condition and I am in a flare up with severe pain, weakness and stiffness.

And this is a key to the success of IRP, reinforcement of things that we already know, but have chosen to ignore the significance of.\r\nAnother huge benefit of being structured in approach is that more time can be devoted to tackling specific issues one at a time, as the programme progresses, we develop the confidence to talk frankly and honestly about the problems we have had and/or are having.\r\nWe have to acknowledge, and become comfortable with the realisation that we are only ever one drink away from a lapse or a relapse. Identifying and managing the thoughts and feelings that could lead us towards that one drink is a fundamental building block of sustained recovery. IRP provides the techniques we have to master - it is then up to us to do just that.\r\nI cannot praise the programme enough. At first I found it a little intimidating, but gradually, things started to sink in and I could see how this would work for me, and equally found that, after a while I was able to contribute back into the group, and that is a great feeling.\r\nA big thanks from me to all at Inclusions for the incredible work you do.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-09-23T18:58:45.9366667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-09-25T10:48:20.38","readBy":[{"name":"Midlands Partnership NHS Foundation Trust","count":6},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2020)","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/788880","id":"788880"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/788880/responses","id":"788880"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/788880/healthservices","id":"788880"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/788880/tags","id":"788880"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rrex4-as","id":"RREX4-AS","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/structure","id":"structure"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/course%20content","id":"course content"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20tools","id":"given tools"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gain%20skills","id":"gain skills"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/791763","id":"791763"}]},{"id":788935,"author":"Dad's daughter","authorRoleId":4,"authorRole":"a relative","title":"My dad’s admission to stroke ward","body":"Jo, a Healthcare Support Worker answered my phone call from outside the front door of Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.

She was being treated for frailty and cognitive decline. In accordance with Lockdown Government policy she was denied a visitor.  \r\nDuring her admission my mother who is deaf and registered partially sighted became agitated and delirious. Telephone calls on the ward phone became increasingly upsetting to the whole family as it became apparent that my mother was acutely distressed. She begged us to come to the hospital and take her home.  \r\nAfter several fraught telephone conversations with both ward nursing and medical staff (on the issue of my mother’s capacity) it was decided that my mother would be allowed home as soon as possible in order to allow her to recover from her ordeal in a familiar environment with her family. I strongly feel that if my mother had been afforded the right to an essential visitor it would have been possible for her to remain an inpatient long enough to have the investigations that on a more recent hospital admission have revealed her diagnosis of dementia.  \r\nAgitated and distressed patients with a CONFIRMED diagnosis of dementia have been afforded the right to an essential visitor during lockdown. Agitated and distressed patients who are SUSPECTED of having dementia should be afforded the same privilege. To do otherwise is surely inhumane.  \r\nI have already contacted the Scottish Government on this issue. The reply I received from the Government made it quite clear that the hospital visiting policy be implemented using a flexible compassionate and person centred approach. In order to comply with the Government’s policy it would be necessary for senior management in the Royal Infirmary to advise managers at ward level to use their discretion and permit the flexibility that the Scottish Government told me it desires.

The measuring was very uncomfortable and painful and I had stated I couldn't tolerate them going that far into my uterus without some form of anaesthetic.  \r\nI was told a coil would have to be fitted which I said I did not want as I had had one removed earlier that year so we would have to discuss alternatives, I was told there were none. The country then went into lockdown and late into this, June, I was called to say they were doing some procedures. I went for a pre assessment to see if I was suitable, I was. The procedure was not explained, I mentioned I was not having a coil, I then had to isolate for 2 weeks, be tested for the covid virus 2 days before the date to go in to the victoria hospital, kirkcaldy in July.  \r\nNobody contacted me to discuss the procedure during the 2 weeks, I had been added to a consultants list whom I had never met or spoken to until the date, I had no idea what was going to take place, how long it would take or what to bring with me. I had been handed a letter that had no instructions and I wasn't contacted after the test, just had been told if I did not get a call the test would have been negative.  \r\nI arrived at the hospital to be left waiting for over half an hour then shifted to the ENT ward, some problem with beds? My treatment after this was distressing. I was upset and anxious I had not been told it would be a general anaesthetic. I have a real fear after waking to them taking the long tube from my throat in my one and only other operation I have had in life. The anaesthetist seemed annoyed and unsympathetic and stated on the list of importance I was way down the scale, then proceeded with the fear factor that it was very unpleasant to have my procedure done under a local anaesthetic and I would really not like it. I felt coerced, I relented under duress to the general, Then comes to the matter of fitting of a coil, which the original doctor had put on my file I was having it fitted, then the other consultant had decided I was having too. I stated I would not, which should have ended the conversation which led them to continue to ask and under extreme stress, I had to agree. Again, I felt coerced. I know its a scary time with the virus, but the human factor was completely missing, I got no after care leaflet or any details on what to expect or what to look out for if something may be wrong, or who to contact, I left very upset and anxious to the way I was treated and emailed a complaint the next day.  \r\nI got phone calls but did not feel anything had or could be done to make things right. The procedure should not have been done unless the same care and attention to detail to patient care, could be followed. I am left feeling upset and disappointed. I have since had the coil removed, which is another horror story for another day, it was like a form of torture to have it removed. This has made me unsure whether to ask for medical help if anything goes wrong in the future, I cant risk such bad treatment again.","criticality":"strongly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-09-19T11:24:31.0933333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-09-25T11:02:00.397","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Fife","count":11},{"name":"Fife Health & Social Care Partnership","count":3},{"name":"St. Andrews University ScotGEM Medical Students","count":1},{"name":"Plymouth University Health and Human Sciences students, 2018","count":1},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/787649","id":"787649"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/787649/responses","id":"787649"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/787649/healthservices","id":"787649"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/787649/tags","id":"787649"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/f704h_502","id":"F704H_502","score":1},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxious","id":"anxious"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disappointed","id":"disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/distressing","id":"distressing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fear","id":"fear"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stress","id":"stress"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20upset","id":"very upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anaesthetic","id":"Anaesthetic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bleed","id":"bleed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/coil","id":"coil"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ent","id":"ent"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kept%20informed","id":"kept informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/listening%20to%20me","id":"Listening to me"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/menopausal","id":"menopausal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/patient%20after%20care","id":"Patient after care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/patient%20care","id":"patient care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/polyp","id":"polyp"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/post-op","id":"post-op"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/some%20care","id":"some care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/test","id":"test"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/torture","id":"torture"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/uncomfortable","id":"uncomfortable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unsure","id":"unsure"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/uterus","id":"uterus"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20disappointed","id":"very disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/uncared%20for","id":"uncared for"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/789346","id":"789346"}]},{"id":781933,"author":"Missruss","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Disappointed with Customer Service","body":"Telephoned the surgery as head, ears and neck was in pain.

The medical staff are extremely professional and ensure that they give you time as an individual.

Although my care during my c-section was second to none, I can't say the same for the care on the ward. First I was sent home from my pre-op without medication so had to return. Then on the day of the section we waited from 7.30am-4pm for the operation with around 3-4hrs of no communication from staff to be told we were almost going home because it was late. My first night on the ward was good with some staff being very supportive and helping to change baby, support with  breastfeeding and respond to need for pain relief. However, one member of staff did put baby in bed with me along with my changing bag and said I would have to change baby myself because she was too busy. She never came back so I ended up co-sleeping, something I never wanted to do, especially on my first night as a first time mum. After one night I was feeling ready to go home and asked for the baby checks to be completed so we could be discharged. We asked different staff members all day to be told at 4pm that the staff who conducted the checks weren't around so I would have to stay another night. I could have gone home but would have had to return at 10am the next day and wait to be seen. I reluctantly stayed to multiple car journeys. My second night was unfortunately a busy night. I felt like I was left alone. Pain relief took ages to come, no support with a poor latch, no support with baby because I was mobile after having the catheter removed and limited response to the buzzers being pressed in my room for other women's first nights so lots of crying babies and unsupported new mums. A sad night to be a part of unfortunately. I completely understand that it was a busy few days and under the current pressure of covid19 maybe things are different. However, I do feel the level of care was below par and there could certainly be some improvements.

I phoned the NHS 111 service where I was told someone would contact me within 20 minutes. I phoned 4 times before I spoke to someone. I was unhappy with one of the responses who said they were due to go off shift shortly and was not able to help me. I hung up and phoned again.  \r\n  \r\nThis time I was taken to the Northern General Hospital where I saw 2 women and they listened to me for a very long time. They were very good. A consultant came to see me as well and he gave me details about an app called ‘Feeling Good’ to listen to. There’s 12 different pieces to listen to. You listen to the first one for about 6 times, then the second one for 6 times and so on, and I got to say these helped me a lot. They calm you right down and I feel much better now, 90% better. I take my meds from my GP and meditate every day.  \r\n  \r\nA lady called Felicity from the Trust came to see me at home and gave me some leaflets. She also told me about the 4-5-6 breathing technique. I wish I could remember Felicity’s surname and where in the Trust she was from as I would really like to thank her. She also gave me some numbers to contact a helpline number and a number for SPA.
