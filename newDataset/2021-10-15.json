I realize the NHS has a lot on its plate at the moment and I don’t have a particular problem with Bingham Medical Centre.  I have only lived in Bingham for just over a year, I look after my mother who has dementia.  I think it’s a mistake for Bingham not to be involved in the vaccine program, particularly now for the booster jabs. Not everyone has a car to get to the various vaccine centres. Personally, I don’t mind taking my chances on the public transport, I can go to Boots the chemist’s at the Victoria Centre etc., but it’s more tricky for my mother.  We have friends with cars, of course, but realistically a £40 taxi journey is needed.  And I just don’t get it?  Surely, if Bingham Medical Centre took part in the vaccine rollout, everyone’s a winner: more people vaccinated more cheaply, and great publicity for the practice. I think for these reasons and others, the centre has made a massive error. Even if the vaccine was administered by Bingham pharmacy, that would be something. At this stage, it can’t be that difficult to organize.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2021-10-14T16:28:28","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-10-15T09:29:04","readBy":[{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2021)","count":2}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/886798","id":"886798"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/886798/responses","id":"886798"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/886798/healthservices","id":"886798"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/886798/tags","id":"886798"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/c84017","id":"C84017","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dementia","id":"dementia"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/great","id":"great"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pharmacy","id":"Pharmacy"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/903194","id":"903194"}]},{"id":886794,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"The best practise","body":"As always, Stillington Surgery stands out as the best surgery in the UK by a country mile.

The receptionist showed no understanding of the fact the surgery has a duty of care to ensure patients have medication and expected me to wait two days to get my prescription filled. After repeatedly informing her that there is a duty of care, she finally agreed she would ‘see’ if the doctor could do it today. Unsurprisingly, an hour later the prescription had been signed off by the person with an actual medical degree who understands that you cannot leave a vulnerable patient without their medication. The reception staff need to understand that life is complicated and there are many reasons why someone who suffers anxiety and depression, works a 72 hour week, cares for 2 small children and is still suffering post Covid fatigue, failed to sort the prescription.

She felt under pressure to provide beds, and I fully understood the need to free up A&E beds, having spent 8 hours there myself on 9 September.  \r\nI agreed after being told that she understood that the Discharge Lounge was staffed by nurses, and set up with the necessary facilities to care for my needs.  \r\nI was told there may be a delay in providing my drugs for discharge. I was taken down in a wheelchair from the comfort of a bed on a ward to a large room set out with upright chairs, which were very uncomfortable given my wounds. After half an hour I was in such discomfort that I had to walk around for half an hour, by which time I was exhausted. I asked for a pillow so that I could have a degree of comfort. None were available and a member of staff had to go to a ward to obtain a pillow. Eventually I was offered a chair with foot support, the only one in the room.  \r\nI eventually spent 3 hours waiting for my drugs, with no pain relief. By the time my drugs were delivered I was exhausted and in pain.  \r\nThe chief nursing officer and chief executive visited the lounge whilst I was there and I recounted my experience to them. I write this in the hope that my comments were taken on board and that facilities have been improved and delays reduced.  \r\nIt was known the previous day that I was due to be discharged and if my prescriptions has been filled in advance the process would have been much shorter.  \r\nIt is unacceptable to have only one chair with foot support available when people are going home with surgical wounds and in severe discomfort.  \r\nMy life was saved, for which I thank the medical and nursing staff profusely, however the discharge process caused unnecessary pain and suffering and I hope that the process has been improved since my experience.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-10-13T14:21:23.3833333","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2021-10-15T10:07:58.7","readBy":[{"name":"Ulster University, MBBS (Medicine) 2021","count":1},{"name":"Healthwatch Portsmouth","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/886247","id":"886247"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/886247/responses","id":"886247"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/886247/healthservices","id":"886247"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/886247/tags","id":"886247"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rhu03_180","id":"RHU03_180","score":0},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/access%20to%20pain%20relief","id":"access to pain relief"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appendicitis","id":"appendicitis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/discharge%20wait","id":"Discharge wait"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/drugs","id":"drugs"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency%20surgery","id":"emergency surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hospital%20discharge","id":"hospital discharge"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/portsmouth","id":"Portsmouth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/saved%20my%20life","id":"saved my life"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unnecessary%20suffering","id":"unnecessary suffering"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wait%20for%20medication","id":"wait for medication"}]},{"id":886810,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"covid boster","body":"went for my booster jab this morning. arrived a few mins early as is my custom only to be told they were running approx 20 mins late and go away and come back later did as told only to be told on my return to go away again . when i at last got in it was a shambles 30 to 40 people al crowded together waiting jabs no distancing rules ques of people standing together. obviously booked appointments to close together.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2021-10-14T12:36:12","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-10-15T10:09:55","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/886810","id":"886810"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/886810/responses","id":"886810"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/886810/healthservices","id":"886810"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/886810/tags","id":"886810"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/c81054","id":"C81054","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/887729","id":"887729"}]},{"id":886250,"author":"TPPcglbrum","authorRoleId":8,"authorRole":"a staff member posting for a patient/service user","title":"I now have a better understanding of my addiction","body":"It was from the age of 14 when I first started to drink, I was allowed to at family events as alcohol was heavily ingrained into the culture of my family’s celebrations. I didn’t notice that I had a problem with alcohol as I associated my drinking with happy times and people enjoying themselves. Over time my family would comment on how much I was drinking and express their concern for me. However I wasn’t prepared to address my issues regarding alcohol, therefore my problems continued.  \r\nI would often leave myself with no money for the rest of the week because I had spent it all on alcohol. I found myself becoming aggressive and staring fights unnecessarily, I had even been so drunk that I’d wander home alone putting myself into vulnerable situations. Due to my actions I have lost many relationships, with friends and family, as they no longer trust me, I’ve missed countless Sundays with my children because I was hungover. To top it all off I have given myself liver problems as a result to my years of binge drinking.  \r\nI tried to take control of my problems many times, I avoided friends who would invite me out and I even went as far as giving away my bank card so I could withdraw money, unfortunately I realised these options weren’t realistic and didn’t work. Eventually I reached out to my GP who referred me to CGL. From sitting their course my CGL keyworker informed me about Intuitive Thinking Skills, this sounded like the solution I was looking for and I asked to be referred so I could have a better understanding of my addiction. I then sat their Intuitive Recovery, Skills Tu Life and Enoughs Enough courses. My experience there was very positive, I was able to further my understanding about addiction and how my brain was working. The tutors I sat these course with were friendly and extremely helpful. I even found a new job more suitable than my previous one with their help.  \r\nThe Intuitive Recovery course teaches many different tools and skills to use in day to day life but the one that with me the most was transposing, separating whether I want something or if IT wants something. I often use this for decision making in all aspects of life. I noticed I needed to use my ADR (Addictive Desire Recognition) a lot, however my brain has now made new associations and I find that my AD (Addictive Desire) doesn’t kick in half as much.  \r\nSince completing the courses I have rebuilt relationships with my friends and family, I am now sober and able to spend more time with my children which has meant a much better relationship between us, I have a new job with more money to spend, and finally I am happier, healthier and my mental state is much more stable. I am now planning to continue building these relationships, progress with my career and set a good example for my children.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-10-13T14:55:39.54","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-10-15T10:10:38.027","readBy":[{"name":"Change Grow Live","count":4},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2021)","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/886250","id":"886250"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/886250/responses","id":"886250"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/886250/healthservices","id":"886250"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/886250/tags","id":"886250"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/nms-cglb-south","id":"nms-cglb-south","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/addiction","id":"addiction"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/alcohol","id":"alcohol"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/drinking","id":"drinking"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happier","id":"happier"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helpful","id":"helpful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/life%20changing","id":"life changing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/understanding","id":"understanding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/course%20content","id":"course content"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20tools","id":"given tools"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/healthier","id":"healthier"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/better%20understanding","id":"better understanding"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/888219","id":"888219"}]},{"id":886819,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Quite lovely ","body":"During these tricky times I think it’s appropriate to thank all the staff for the work they’re doing.
