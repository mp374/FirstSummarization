[{"id":1041216,"author":"Mudella green","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Mental Health services","body":"I was hospitalised in a mental health unit last year. This was my first experience with the mental health service and what an experience it was. After six months of dealing with life and all its stresses my mental health issues began, with me losing a friend that was very close to me. Everything came to a boil in early March last year.  \r\nI was put on a ward on a Saturday night - that was my first contact with mental health services. I was very confused initially and didn't know where I was. There are a lot of things that I wasn't aware of.  \r\nAfter about four to five days, I started to come back to myself. I was taken off the medication prescribed by my GP, which I had an allergic reaction to and I misused as well, none of which helped my situation. I was on this medication for less than a month but it was hell.  \r\nWhen I arrived at the hospital I was in psychosis. I asked staff questions, only to find out that none of them were permanent members of staff and had no access to information. This went on for most of my stay in hospital - me asking for information and getting nowhere. I understood that we were patients in a mental institution. But we were still human beings with lives and responsibility outside of the hospital unit. There was no information that was accessible to the patients. Not even about your own care.  \r\nWe had review meetings about our care where we could ask questions of the managers but we never knew when or what time our reviews would be. This was very frustrating. Think about it. You've gone from being able to arrange your own appointments, having access to your own things to a situation where you have to ask for everything. Even the simplest of things like going out for a walk you needed permission for. For someone that's always been in control of their life this was very difficult. As the weeks went by it became even harder to make sense of it all. If you were awake before 11:00 there was nothing to do in the mornings. This I found very confusing and there was a lack of support.  \r\nWhen I spoke to members of members of staff I was told to go to the office or they would get back to me in 10 minutes. Sometime days later they still had no information. The days became very long and dreary and depressing. You were left to think about all the things in your life that had gone wrong which does not help when you are having a mental breakdown.  \r\nI was on a female ward and on two occasions male patients from other wards broke into the female wards and were able to walk around the ward past women's bedrooms. Members of staff were very slow to react and sometimes had little power to do anything. I was awake when both of these incidents occurred, lucky me. I must say there were staff members that would do everything that they could to help patients especially during the daytime. But weekends and night were the worst part of my stay.  \r\nMy biggest problem was the lack of communication. Between the staff members and patients also between staff members and management. When I had my review meetings there was basic information that was lacking from my file. It took them almost a month to get my address correct. There was just a breakdown in communication. This went on even after I was discharged from hospital. I had to be the one to be phoning the community mental health team to get them on board asking questions about my care or lack of care at the time. I found the crisis team was a joke. In the end I emailed everyone that I could reach, apologising for spelling mistakes in the e-mail, but I was able to get my point across.  \r\nAfter everything that had happened I was left feeling confused, frustrated and angry. Patients had to call the doctors to get the care needed now looking back. I can see that you have fight for everything no matter what circumstances you're in.  \r\nI am grateful for my stay in hospital. It helped me to start dealing a with the past. If I hadn't been admitted this would not have happened. Yes, I was given a psychologist and was helped by an amazing support worker.  \r\nThe service was suspended back in December so I have been put on another waiting list. But I have a better understanding of my mental health - how I got to where I was this time last year. For that I will forever be grateful to the mental health service, it has given me the space and time to deal with my past.  \r\nIt is now up to the one year anniversary of my stay in hospital. I am grateful for the help that I was given. Yes, it wasn't all good. But they have some amazing people working in the mental health service. It's just a shame there is a lack of support for them and for the patients in general.  \r\nThank you NHS","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-03-13T12:56:49.0466667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-03-20T08:48:54.72","readBy":[{"name":"Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust","count":17}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1041216","id":"1041216"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1041216/responses","id":"1041216"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1041216/healthservices","id":"1041216"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1041216/tags","id":"1041216"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rha06","id":"RHA06","score":3},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rhanm-rowan2","id":"rhanm-rowan2","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/angry","id":"angry"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confused","id":"confused"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frustrated","id":"frustrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bored","id":"bored"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communications","id":"Communications"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/depressed","id":"depressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/information","id":"information"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/psychologist","id":"psychologist"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/psychosis","id":"psychosis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/records","id":"records"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/some%20staff","id":"some staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support%20worker","id":"support worker"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unsupported","id":"unsupported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting%20list","id":"waiting list"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/patience","id":"patience"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment%20reviews","id":"treatment reviews"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/delays","id":"delays"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unsafe","id":"unsafe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/difficult","id":"difficult"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/undersatnding","id":"undersatnding"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1047744","id":"1047744"}]},{"id":1043859,"author":"Shagq75","authorRoleId":8,"authorRole":"a staff member posting for a patient/service user","title":"Male medical ward is top class","body":"I like that the ward is kept at a comfortable temperature and that if you become a little chilly, you can just hide under the blankets in bed.

Every time I visit the surgery on her behalf (there is little point in ringing) the waiting room is empty. Yesterday however it was crowded with three patients waiting to see the doctor. 8 weeks ago she fell at home and broke her hip. She has been back home recovering for the last 4 weeks.  \r\nI explained to the receptionist ( a very helpful person). that my mother had a urinary problem and was losing weight and was so weak she could barely stand. I asked for a home visit to be made and she said she would arrange it. Later in the day the doctor rang to say that they did not want to visit. My mother's sister in law insisted so they reluctantly agreed to visit without specifying a time. Later we were informed that it would be a paramedic. No one turned up.  \r\nUnlike the many times before when diagnosis was made over the telephone, my family refused to accept this. The following day another appointment for a visit was made.

Was told it was a 30-40 minute wait - which was fine.  \r\nHad been waiting for 1.5 hrs, so went up to the receptionist to ask if they knew roughly how much longer I would be waiting as people were coming and going and I was still waiting.  \r\nReceptionist stated that I had only been in the department for an hour as they clocked me in at 10:25 am, even though I had checked in at 10 am. The receptionist stated that this is how they do things, and as I was only checked in for an hour on their system I would have to take a seat and there were 4 people ahead of me.  \r\nTime went on and I was still sitting at 12 pm (2 hours after I arrived/ checked in) so again politely asked the receptionist if it would be much longer, as my daughter was waiting in the car for me for the 2 hours. Receptionist phoned through and was talking to the radiographer on the phone in-front of me discussing the situation, stating I had only been in the department for 1.25 hrs. When I corrected them saying that I was here for 2 hours, they replied back with attitude and said to take a seat and I would be taken next.  \r\nI got my scan after 2 hrs and 25 mins of waiting.  \r\nWhen the radiographer came to collect me from the waiting area, they said with attitude that they understood that I had been waiting and will need to just wait in this other area until this other patient was took.  \r\nI am thankful that we have the NHS and that I got my scan.

I’m just not happy at how I was treated during my visit to the hospital.  \r\nThere was no patient-centred care or compassion shown to myself, I was just another number waiting to be seen.

First concern was trying to get parked as the clock ticked towards appointment time - how do management really expect you to check in relaxed and with your blood pressure at an acceptable level to operate? After eventually finding a parking space, life got a lot better - as the building has cheery volunteers at the front door to guide you to the correct unit.  \r\nAfter checking in at reception (very pleasant staff) the nursing staff were outstanding - professional, cheery and re-assuring. Nurse Jean was everything you could wish for in a nursing professional - she made the whole challenging experience very positive and instinctively know how to deal with this rather nervous and concerned patient. Along with the other nurses in the day care surgical unit (and I hope their NHS choir experience is a real success), this team don't just talk about excellence they are delivering it to patients.  \r\nOnce in theatre itself, the surgical team displayed a superb blend of expertise, experience and re-assurance - plus an ability to communicate with me using easily understood vocabulary - I really appreciated this skill. This experience was not something I had been looking forward to but the NHS delivered a superb service and made me feel really looked after.  \r\nI have zero criticism of the medical, admin or support staff at the New Victoria Infirmary - the hygiene and housekeeping standards also appeared to be of the highest standards.  \r\nThank you to the NHS team for delivering a truly excellent medical service to this patient - now to recuperate and get on with life. I have had a few days to reflect on what I've been through, so this review has been well thought through and I stand by the content. My only criticism of the day is aimed at politicians who think sick people should travel on unreliable and inconvenient public transport to hospital (and probably miss their appointment).","criticality":"minimally critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-03-17T17:17:44.24","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-03-20T09:27:26.74","readBy":[{"name":"East Renfrewshire Health & Social Care Partnership","count":2},{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":6}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1043428","id":"1043428"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1043428/responses","id":"1043428"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1043428/healthservices","id":"1043428"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1043428/tags","id":"1043428"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/nvh-day-surgery","id":"nvh-day-surgery","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20pressure","id":"blood pressure"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/car%20parking","id":"car parking"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cleanliness","id":"cleanliness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/concerned","id":"concerned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/day%20surgery","id":"day surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/excellent%20staff","id":"excellent staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/expertise","id":"expertise"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/knowledge","id":"knowledge"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/looked%20after","id":"looked after"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nursing%20staff","id":"nursing staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/positive","id":"positive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reception","id":"reception"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/relief","id":"relief"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/theatre%20staff","id":"theatre staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/volunteers","id":"volunteers"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appreciated","id":"appreciated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/admin%20staff","id":"admin staff"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1044622","id":"1044622"}]},{"id":1043431,"author":"Tersg66","authorRoleId":8,"authorRole":"a staff member posting for a patient/service user","title":"The care I am being given has been amazing","body":"I have been in and out of hospital since June.

My mental health gradually deteriorated to the point where I became completely debilitated when I was in my early 20s. I had to quit my job and I became extremely depressed. So I decided to seek professional help. The type of treatment that was recommended to me was CBT.  \r\nThe treatment commenced in 2022 and my therapist was almost immediately able to establish a sense of trust, and that allowed me to relax and open up about my problems. Initially we focused on issues regarding things like leaving the house, and she helped me to face my fears as opposed to avoiding them. Later on she noticed that there might be something else wrong with me and she suggested that I might also be autistic. So she advised me to read about the disorder and see if I can relate to it. After reading and hearing things about it I was almost certain that I had ASD. This revelation is perhaps the biggest takeaway from this course of therapy, as it allowed me to gain a much better understanding of who I am. I now realise that there is a large community of people that share the same problems and struggles that I have.  \r\nMy therapist also taught me how to do behaviour experiments, which was a useful technique that enabled me to face my fears and it allowed me to learn how to tolerate my anxiety. The service and care that I received could have been better in certain areas. My biggest dissatisfaction comes from the fact that there was never any continuity from session to session, and every week it seemed like we were starting from scratch.  \r\nOverall, this is a service that I would very much recommend to anyone who is suffering from OCD or any kind of anxiety disorder. With a condition like OCD it is vital to put the appropriate interventions in place as early as possible, and not let it fester and eventually take over your life.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-03-14T17:44:06.6933333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-03-20T09:45:23.467","readBy":[{"name":"Southern Health and Social Care Trust","count":11}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1041765","id":"1041765"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1041765/responses","id":"1041765"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1041765/healthservices","id":"1041765"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1041765/tags","id":"1041765"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003-cbt","id":"zt003-cbt","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cbt","id":"cbt"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/continuity","id":"continuity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/coping%20strategies","id":"Coping strategies"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ocd","id":"ocd"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/recommend","id":"recommend"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/satisfactory","id":"satisfactory"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/therapist","id":"therapist"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/relaxed","id":"relaxed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/trust","id":"Trust"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disjointed","id":"disjointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/interventions","id":"interventions"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1045471","id":"1045471"}]},{"id":1041574,"author":"septembergj58","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Cataract consultation","body":"After being on the list at Elgin hospital for a year, I was given an appointment at the cataract clinic in ARI. We drove for 2 hours in horrendous weather, to get to the appointment. I arrived at the ward and reception was unmanned, so stood waiting with another 2 people who had entered just before me. A nurse came in and said to take a seat in the waiting area round the corner. I waited for over 30 minutes, then had notification of a voice-mail on my phone. I checked the voice mail, to find it was the ward asking why I had not turned up. I went back to reception, which was still unmanned, and a domestic assistant did her best to help. She came and advised me, that she had informed them I was in the waiting area all the time.  \r\nDue to Covid masks had to be worn, which due to being claustrophobic, causes me severe anxiety. I waited a further 40 minutes, with still no-one coming near me, and could not sit with a mask on any longer, so had to get out. I had left home over 3 hours prior, and there was no water available, there was a coffee machine that was switched off. I told the receptionist I had been sitting waiting for 80 minutes, and just got what I found to be a very rude reply, after which my anxiety had escalated to the point I was having a panic attack, and I left the ward.

He has cancer and a heart condition.  \r\nHe had a hospital stay of around a week and was discharged home. He thought he was told a physio would visit him at home however that referral was not made before leaving hospital. He was also told to contact OT once he was home.  \r\nAfter not hearing from anyone for 2 weeks I called North Ayrshire HSCP who said I had called the wrong team and they couldn’t transfer my call and to call Saltcoats Town Hall as that was the local service. I called Saltcoats Town Hall and they checked and advised there was no record of a referral and family members or service users cannot make referrals to the community rehab team only medical professionals and I needed to call the GP practice and gave me a number to call. I called the number given to be told they were the wrong GP practice and to call another number which I called to discover it was another Medical Group - in the same building with same reception team. They advised as he has been a recent inpatient the discharging consultant would need to make the referral.  \r\nI called Crosshouse Hospital and asked to speak with the discharging consultants secretary and was put through. This secretary was on annual leave however another consultants secretary spoke with me, took the details and said they would pass it on. The discharging consultants secretary called me today, went over the information I had provided the day before and advised the consultant was on annual leave however they would discuss with another consultant. They then came back to advise there was no need for dietitian involvement as he was eating on the ward (reason for admission was fall due to no eating or drinking for 5 days so I think it’s reasonable to conclude that he eats well when nurses are prompting but less well at home). He was discharged from physio as he was mobilising on the ward.  \r\nHe was discharged home to a 2 story house with bed and bathroom upstairs. He has no equipment and significant 1 sided weakness following a road traffic accident around 40 years ago. There is only one bannister and he was not assessed on the stairs so I am not clear how the decision to discharge was made without assessment on the stairs. Again reason for admission was a collapse and fall down the stairs. The secretary agreed to try once more with the consultant however didn’t think it would work and advised me to try the GP again.  \r\nAt this point I’m stuck. My uncle is becoming frailer. As a family we have installed the bannister and got him the equipment he needs. I’ve asked community OT to request grab-rails which the duty OT done and hopefully these will be in soon. He continues to have poor balance, reduced strength and is starting to give up. It’s not a big ask for some physio and some dietician advice but I cannot work out how to make this happen.  \r\nI am exceptionally frustrated and feel I am letting my uncle down.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-03-17T17:40:25.09","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-03-20T10:02:28.263","readBy":[{"name":"North Ayrshire Health & Social Care Partnership","count":7},{"name":"Office of Ruth Maguire ( Mp for Cunninghame South )","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1043433","id":"1043433"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1043433/responses","id":"1043433"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1043433/healthservices","id":"1043433"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1043433/tags","id":"1043433"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/nahscp-community-intermediate","id":"nahscp-community-intermediate","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confused","id":"confused"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frustrated","id":"frustrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/worried","id":"worried"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/advice","id":"advice"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/equipment","id":"equipment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/failure","id":"failure"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/referral","id":"referral"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/rehab","id":"rehab"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1047762","id":"1047762"}]},{"id":1043435,"author":"geminiqr38","authorRoleId":8,"authorRole":"a staff member posting for a patient/service user","title":"Great hospital care","body":"I have been in hospital since last Saturday.

The staff are doing their best under the circumstances and conditions they work in, but they are extremely over worked and very underpaid for the job they do.

I was still in pain but nobody came to ask after my condition or tell me how long they thought it would be before a drain was inserted to relieve the pain.  \r\nAfter the catheter insertion, the pressure was relieved but somebody forgot to tell my bladder! It was a level of 10+ and persistent in waves.  \r\nFor a period of time nobody came to ask after me, nor offer any refreshments. Then a doctor came by but their attitude all along was no empathy, no concern of the pain I was experiencing, just a desire for me to go home, despite my inability to walk pain-free.  \r\nUnfortunately my OD prevented immediate discharge, and I was kept in longer. Although as for the observation, it was in name only. Nobody looked in regularly, not even a glass of water was on offer. My only refreshment was a meal brought in by a person I believe to be a domestic?I was very appreciative of that.  \r\nThe above mentioned doctor did come in but that was to do with my OD at the start and my recall is that the tone was never in a supportive way.  \r\nI had never, nor would I expect preferential treatment, but I had thought those who knew me would offer some empathy and the same courtesy as you would any patient, when able to do so.  \r\nOnce I was ready to be discharged I had to arrange my own travel home, despite being in 10 + level pain.  \r\nI felt my care after the catheter insertion was very detached, just leaving me in agony, not even attempting to relieve the pain.  \r\nI feel this is not the level of care anybody should have to experience.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-03-17T18:24:53.59","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-03-20T10:34:39.11","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Ayrshire & Arran","count":8}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1043440","id":"1043440"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1043440/responses","id":"1043440"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1043440/healthservices","id":"1043440"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1043440/tags","id":"1043440"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/a210h_180","id":"A210H_180","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ignored","id":"ignored"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/attention","id":"attention"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bladder","id":"bladder"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/catheter","id":"catheter"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/domestic%20staff","id":"domestic staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ed","id":"ed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/empathy","id":"empathy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/follow%20up","id":"follow up"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/in%20pain","id":"in pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/poor%20care","id":"poor care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/poor%20discharge%20arrangements","id":"poor discharge arrangements"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/travel","id":"travel"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/undervalued","id":"undervalued"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unwell","id":"unwell"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting%20time","id":"waiting time"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/food%20&%20drinks","id":"food & drinks"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lack%20of%20concern","id":"lack of concern"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lack%20of%20empathy","id":"lack of empathy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/regular%20checks","id":"regular checks"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1048392","id":"1048392"}]},{"id":1043458,"author":"earthds87","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Brilliant ambulance service","body":"I felt well looked after during transition and transfer, all crews in mid-March were brilliant.  \r\nI send you my thanks .  \r\nHope your hanging around times decline soon.

I telephoned hospital transport and they explained that they had to cancel booking due to heavy demand.  \r\nI am very heavily disabled and require significant support and assistance from the ambulance workers to even access the ambulance. I have cerebral palsy, quadruple bypass, insulin dependent diabetes and iretractable hiccoughs which can result in me losing the ability to breath for short periods of time. This means that any form of public transport is not an option for me. This is all on record all and to cancel at all, and at such short notice, outside office hours, with no option of appeal I find outrageous and unacceptable  \r\nIt is also on record that this is not a routine appointment and that the purpose is to discuss and agree the very real risks of proposed surgery with three booked consultants, some of whom have been brought in from other hospitals. I am not in a position to miss these appointments as I am no longer able to weight bear on my right leg and this has rendered me immobile even with my usual walking aids. I am therefore left with no alternative than to place myself at significant risk and find a way to get there.  \r\nCould you please investigate asap?","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-03-17T18:46:07.5133333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-03-20T10:58:24.14","readBy":[{"name":"Scottish Ambulance Service","count":3}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1043492","id":"1043492"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1043492/responses","id":"1043492"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1043492/healthservices","id":"1043492"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1043492/tags","id":"1043492"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/scot-ambulance-pts","id":"scot-ambulance-pts","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disgusted","id":"disgusted"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/aids","id":"AIDS"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appeal","id":"appeal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bypass","id":"bypass"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cancellation","id":"cancellation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cerebral%20palsy","id":"cerebral palsy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/concerned","id":"concerned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dependent","id":"dependent"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diabetes","id":"diabetes"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disabled","id":"disabled"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hospital%20transport","id":"hospital transport"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/insulin","id":"insulin"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/insulin%20dependent","id":"insulin dependent"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/leg","id":"leg"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unhappy","id":"unhappy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/walking","id":"walking"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/notification%20in%20advance","id":"notification in advance"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1044174","id":"1044174"}]},{"id":1043557,"author":"defenderzb45","authorRoleId":4,"authorRole":"a relative","title":"Wonderful hospital staff","body":"My mum was refered by her doctor to A and E.

My appointment was on time and I had my pre-checks with two members of staff, one involved in eye checks and another taking blood pressure, pulse etc. The staff were lovely and put me at ease, giving me a lovely sense of well-being.  \r\nI then had drops put into my eyes and returned to the waiting room for them to take effect before being called in to see the doctor on duty. The doctor gave my eyes a thorough examination, came up with a diagnosis and told me that I required further investigation at the main eye department of the Truro Hospital, Treliske. They would refer me. Also asked and answered any questions I had. The doctor's manner was good, very kind and understanding, and critical that I had been sent to them when I had no sign of cataracts.  \r\nThe only negative comment I would like to make is that I have had to wait since end of September for this appointment in February. That I should not have been referred to a clinic such as Falmouth that deals mainly with cataract cases, which I do not have, may be a mistake by my doctors surgery. Doctor also said that they hope after their referral that I will hear of an appointment in the next month as the issues they spotted with my eyes Uvitus should not be delayed, but addressed quickly.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-03-16T13:38:53.9766667","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2023-03-20T12:20:01.103","readBy":[],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1042850","id":"1042850"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1042850/responses","id":"1042850"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1042850/healthservices","id":"1042850"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1042850/tags","id":"1042850"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l82049","id":"L82049","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cataracts","id":"cataracts"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diagnosis","id":"diagnosis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/eye","id":"eye"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/eye%20drops","id":"eye drops"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kind","id":"kind"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lovely%20staff","id":"lovely staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/referral","id":"referral"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thorough","id":"thorough"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/understanding","id":"understanding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wait%20for%20appointment","id":"wait for appointment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20ease","id":"at ease"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appointment%20on%20time","id":"appointment on time"}]},{"id":1043879,"author":"Supernova88","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Emotionally and physically worn down","body":"In February 2022 I woke up and the world was spinning around me the second I stepped out of bed. This was just the start of many horrendous and debilitating symptoms that I would gain and still to this day, I have no formal diagnosis and no real professional help.  \r\nI am currently suffering from what I have been told informally is chronic urticaria and angioedema and hyperadrenic pots. I also believe I may have small fibre neuropathy and visual snow syndrome but the neurologist I saw said there was nothing wrong with me and again dismissed me.  \r\nI have also recently found out that I have Hypermobile Ehler Danlos Syndrome which is massively related to these syndromes. I have never had such bad care than the care I have received at both Lincoln County Hospital and my surgery. I have been told this is all in my head and that it is anxiety. I have been spoken to like I’m a liar and told off for wasting their time. I now have to wait to see a cardiologist for testing and a diagnosis and I have to wait another 9 months. I have to take four antihistamines a day (I have no allergies) and there aren’t many foods that I don’t react to. I can only wash my hair once a week as my forehead becomes covered in hives and hurts so badly. I have been told by Leicester allergy service that they won’t accept my referral until I have taken four antihistamines a day for two months and then I still have an 18 week wait. I have already taken 3 antihistamines a day since December and it’s barely helped.  \r\nLast night I lay on my bedroom floor and thought I am going to die. My skin felt like it was on fire, my throat was closing up and I was having horrendous adrenaline surges throughout the night. The only way to relieve the adrenaline slightly is to lie flat on the floor. This is my life most nights, I can’t sleep, I can’t rest or relax. It’s pure torture.  \r\nI feel like my life is over, my beautiful children have lost their happy, mum and my husband has lost his soul mate.  \r\nI am now suffering from anxiety and depression due to delayed diagnoses and any form of specialist help.  \r\nWe literally wouldn’t leave a dog like this so why is it that I have been left to feel so scared and alone. I have lost all trust in the NHS and I honestly don’t know how I can carry on.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-03-18T19:52:38.4633333","progress":"Story has a

Unfortunately we weren't able to travel with him. It was incredibly scary leaving out brand new baby with strangers and knowing that he was in surgery despite only being a few hours old. The surgery went as expected and they weren't able to save the second testicle.  \r\nHe then spent 2 nights in intensive care where he had a feeding tube and was oxygen as a result of the surgery.

He still needed oxygen and stayed in hospital for a further 4 days before returning home fit and healthy.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-03-17T19:49:19.1633333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-03-20T12:47:19.54","readBy":[{"name":"University Hospitals Bristol and Weston NHS Foundation Trust","count":2},{"name":"Somerset NHS Foundation Trust","count":4}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1043559","id":"1043559"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1043559/responses","id":"1043559"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1043559/healthservices","id":"1043559"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1043559/tags","id":"1043559"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/ra723","id":"RA723","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rh5a8-422","id":"RH5A8-422","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scared","id":"scared"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/convenience","id":"Convenience"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/intensive%20care","id":"intensive care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/relieved","id":"relieved"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/better%20now","id":"better now"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/prompt%20response","id":"prompt response"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1044703","id":"1044703"}]},{"id":1043937,"author":"Matdw53","authorRoleId":8,"authorRole":"a staff member posting for a patient/service user","title":"I am pleased with the care so far","body":"I am pleased with the care so far i honestly dont think that i have a reason to complain as there hasn't really been anything negative since admission.

Another nurse, came double checked and fully told me of what would happen and when  \r\nThen the surgeon came to me and spend a lot of their time assuring me of what was to happen and how. I then signed the permission document for Cataract Removal and replacement of lens. They marked which eye was to be done with a marker on my forehead, meanwhile other nurses administered various eye drops, one to dilate my pupil, others as local anaesthetic. All this took place between 08:00 and 08:20,  \r\nThen a Nurse took me 20 yards to the operating theatre, I was to lay on a op table. It was very comfortable, the Surgeon advised what was to happen.  \r\nTheir was NO pain No uncomfortable feelings, just a bright light that was fine. Fifteen minutes later, it was done  \r\nWhilst in the theatre, staff had contacted my escort (daughter) to advise that:  \r\nA. I was in theatre, and  \r\nB. It was complete and I could be collected in ten minutes  \r\nI sat for about five minutes felt good and I was given an after care pack, and what and when I had to do further over a four week period  \r\nThe whole procedure was over in less than 45 minutes and we were then back home having a cuppa  \r\nAll the staff were kind and I was well informed at all times  \r\nThank you to all at the QMH  \r\nTo improve nothing really except to try and advise people the op is not what \"we\" imagine (a Scapel advancing on your eyeball slicing it open and tweezers sliding out the old lens and inserting a replacement then stitching it up).

The whole experience has shaken my confidence in dental services in NHS Dumfries & Galloway.  \r\nI ended up having to terminate my interaction with the Emergency Dental Helpline and drive 90 miles to access a NHS dentist in another health board area who explained that a healthy tooth had cracked over a nerve and that was why I was in agony. This meant I had to have a day sick leave from my work to get to dentist and means I am thinking of leaving Dumfries and Galloway for somewhere with satisfactory NHS dental services.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-03-15T02:52:19.8366667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-03-20T13:03:03.04","readBy":[{"name":"NHS 24","count":13}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1042133","id":"1042133"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1042133/responses","id":"1042133"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1042133/healthservices","id":"1042133"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1042133/tags","id":"1042133"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/nhs24_seds","id":"NHS24_SEDS","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20listened%20to","id":"not listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/call%20handing","id":"call handing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dental","id":"dental"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dental%20pain","id":"dental pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency","id":"emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency%20dentist","id":"emergency dentist"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/severe%20pain","id":"severe pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tooth","id":"tooth"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1044216","id":"1044216"}]},{"id":1043942,"author":"Matdw53","authorRoleId":8,"authorRole":"a staff member posting for a patient/service user","title":"Treated good since admission","body":"3 north has bee n a positive level of care so far and i feel like i have been treated good since admission.

The next day I saw the consultant on duty and discussed the treatment plan for abscesses on both right and left legs. I had already seen ortho on call team at A&E on the Tuesday for this on going issue and we decided to put me on the urgent ultrasound list and let me go home. I was told to expect a call on the Wednesday morning with a time to come in for the ultrasound.  \r\nI had still not received a call by Thursday afternoon so contacted the trauma liaison and was told my name was on list and I would have to just wait. So when spoke to consultant on the Sunday we decided for me to still wait on ultrasound.  \r\nOn Sunday I was moved to another bed in my room. I raised concerns about this as I was nebulising for my Asthma and had no access to either an oxygen port or nebuliser machine. I had no buzzer and as someone who is known to take asthma attacks n the night this was concerning. I also had no light so if every light on ward went out at night I had no light to see. This is important as I have a sight impairmentBy the Wednesday I had not seen a doctor from the Sunday and was still waiting on the ultrasound which had been waiting on from the previous Tuesday and had to chase up with the nurse about not seeing doctor. I eventually saw Consultant and they said they would try and chase up the ultrasound. I got the ultrasound on Thursday afternoon and had surgery on the Friday afternoon. But when I arrived back up to the ward I was placed in bed area 7 again even though I had had a GA and nurses could not see me and monitor me. I am still in this position and if there is a problem during the night I can get help as now even though I have a bell the staff can not here it.The nurses on the ward are doing an amazing job for the situation the are in. As a regular in patient I can say this is the worst admission I have experienced and I feel like I have been dumped in a corner and feel like I am a nuisance even though the nurses have tried hard not to make me not feel like this.I have had been having ongoing issues in regard to my care with this health condition and am covered in scars all over. I have seen orthopaedics and surgical arguing in front of me as to who has to treat me. A&E know me very well due to my other health conditions and have said I shouldn't really be going to them as it is an ongoing known condition and not an emergency. They have said there should be a care plan/Treatment pathway sorted.The issue with this is I don't know when to come in as when I come in early to try and prevent it from becoming a big abscess I am sent home. I am told there nothing there but most of time I'm in 2 or 3 days later with a bigger abscess and have to be admitted and go under a GA. The shortest time for this to happen is 3.5 hours. I was an inpatient and told them that this was the situation but was not listened to. By time got home it had a head on it. I refused to come back because of this and waited on it popping 2 days later and then went to A&E to have it dealt with. Then if I wait till it is large I am asked why didn't I come in sooner?The doctors and consultants make me feel like it is my fault or blame it on the medication I use even. A doctor has accused me of having an addiction problem when I asked for certain medication that I know I can take and am not allergic to. This doctor did not talk to me about this or any of my other care teams. I have spoken to GP's, district nurses and my support workers who have regular contact with my in community, often daily, and they had no concerns and had not been consulted about it. I have asked for this to be removed from my records but it has not been.I had a meeting with a consultant back in September/October and it was decided to organise an multidisciplinary meet with all the people involved in my care. This was nearly 6 months ago and am still waiting on this and have been told it is now on the 3rd consultant to organise it. I have had no contact or communication regarding this so don't now what is going on.Being treated as a new case every time means I don't get consistency in my care and am treated as a new trauma every time. I feel my care is not being proactive it is being reactive and just treating the problem just at that time. I know treating traumas people are only seen once or twice so doesn't matter it they always have different consultant but this doesn't work in regard to my care as every consultant tends to treat it different.The way I am cared for and treated makes me feel as if I am a nuisance and an inconvenience.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-03-17T22:34:31.3366667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-03-20T13:17:36.673","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Ayrshire & Arran","count":10}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1043608","id":"1043608"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1043608/responses","id":"1043608"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1043608/healthservices","id":"1043608"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1043608/tags","id":"1043608"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/a111h_110","id":"A111H_110","score":2},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/a&e","id":"a&e"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/abscess","id":"abscess"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/addiction","id":"addiction"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/asthma","id":"asthma"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/buzzer","id":"buzzer"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care%20plan","id":"care plan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/concerned","id":"concerned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/consultant","id":"consultant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/listening","id":"listening"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medical%20records","id":"medical records"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/monitoring","id":"monitoring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/orthopaedics","id":"orthopaedics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/oxygen","id":"oxygen"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ultrasound","id":"ultrasound"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting%20times","id":"waiting times"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/felt%20unsafe","id":"felt unsafe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/like%20a%20nuisance","id":"like a nuisance"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lack%20of%20consistency","id":"lack of consistency"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1044623","id":"1044623"}]},{"id":1043561,"author":"Mr Y","authorRoleId":4,"authorRole":"a relative","title":"Parking issues","body":"My aunt recently had to attend University Hospital Wishaw for a procedure at Day Surgery, I dropped her off promptly at 8:15am at the drop off point at the main entrance.

They are a very caring and dedicated team.\n\nStaff members save for one, took my comments on board regarding matters I complained about (which related to minor disrespect, in the form of friendly emulation of my Tourettes tick which I have to admit is particularly \"catchy\" and which I would have found touching, if it were not for the fact they were my unfortunate jailers... And as such, I demanded that the appropriate boundaries be kept). One staff member however denied having done so, even though it occurred on a recorded video call which I was having with my wife at the time, and then sought to deny that any staff member would have done so (even though multiple other staff apologised to me about it when I mentioned it to them, when they accidentally did it) and then tried to gas light me, putting pressure on a patient who is under section 3 of the mental health act and thus may be on the unit for upto 6 months between reviews. \n\nThe food, staff, accomodation and level of care and support given is genuinely touching, and as a journalist I am intending on writing a very touching article on my good experience, no matter how much of an injustice occurred to bring me to such an experience. \n\nI was not medicated during my stay, and do have some reasons to complain, but these by and large have little to do with the nursing, care, cleaning, pharmacy or clinical teams. \n\nAny individual who requires inpatient psychiatric care would do well to find themselves in such a caring environment for their treatment.

After experiencing the start of labour I called AMH triage, care and consideration was taken by the midwife on the phone. As I lived an hour away and my PMH I was advised to come in for examination.  \r\nIn triage I was seen by Hannah, she examined me and gave me options, this allowed me to feel empowered in my decision making. I explained I was red pathway but on discussion with my consultant in weeks before hand, I wished to deliver in the M/W led unit. This was 100% listened to. Helen the HCSW (who I will never ever forget) came to escort us through to the M/W led unit, the midwife on duty was Katie. Both of these absolute angels & their fast acting decision making saved my Baby’s life.  \r\nMy safety and my babies safety were of upmost concern but also my wishes. I unfortunately required a transfer to the labour ward due to excessive meconium in my broken waters. Katie and Helen escorted us through fast, my daughter was born minutes later. Unfortunately my daughter required neonatal care, my partner still got to cut her cord and although we did lose out on undisturbed golden skin to skin, the team saved my daughter’s life and that’s all that matters and did the best they could to ensure I was heard and reassured when required. As a Nurse myself the “trust” aspect of our job is massive, I found I had to put all my trust in the professionals to take care of my daughter, and they did. Overstretched professionals that are honestly remarkable. I was able to empathise with my patients in regard to trusting us as professionals to care for us as patients.  \r\nI have heard of negative stories surrounding AMH and to be honest it was not my first choice of facilities to deliver my daughter, but due to my PMH and pathway it was safest to attend AMH. I am so glad I did. I can genuinely say I was treated with dignity, compassion, kindness and cared for holistically by every single member of staff we encountered in Triage, MW Unit, Labour ward and Ashgrove ward. Names I remember was Hannah, Helen, Katie, Kira, Kirby, Aurora, and Martha. The staff in these wards were rushed off their feet, yet they always took the time to introduce themselves at the beginning of their shift. 4h obs were obtained on my daughter as per protocol and this was never missed. My daughter’s antibiotic treatment was always timely. The ward was clean. Any questions I had were always answered and if unable to answer they’d go find out. It appeared all staff worked well as a team. Nothing was ever too much hassle.  \r\nThe only negative was as I had not anticipated to be in longer than a day, I required some medication that was unstocked on the ward. I did have to chase this up several times. If I had not received this medicine it could have been detrimental to my health. I also had to ensure I had my own painkillers as I’d often asked for in the morning and I was never given. This isn’t a problem at all as I was more than happy to supply my own paracetamol etc it was just something I picked up on.

Booked the morning off work to attend, when I arrived the receptionists seemed confused where I should be (online system wasn’t working). After a few minutes was told which waiting area; while waiting for my appointment and after being booked in a nurse came and spoke to me saying there has been confusion as it’s a telephone consultation. The letter specifically stated the hospital as the location, and more infuriatingly I’d wasted a holiday to attend something I didn’t need to attend.  \r\nAs I’ve recently started a new role so my holidays are limited and having to use a holiday unnecessarily is very frustrating and annoying, plus the receptionist could have clarified this at the time of arrival rather than me wasting another 25 minutes of my time. Completely unacceptable and incredibly frustrating.  \r\nWe hear how much it costs the NHS in wasted time and missed appointments but this instance just makes a mockery of the whole system; a simple booking undone by poor communication. When I did speak with the consultant they initially said they couldn’t see my notes from my recent blood tests at the local surgery, which the consultant put down to the surgery being in another county/district; When I said the surgery was in Lincolnshire the consultant then found the notes. I know consultants have hundreds of patients but surely having the relevant information before meeting the patient is basic principles (please correct me if I’m wrong).  \r\nI know how stretched the NHS is but this whole process has left me feeling disillusioned and frustrated for such a basic appointment, not impressed and far from happy.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-03-18T08:32:54.6433333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-03-20T13:40:59.867","readBy":[{"name":"United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust","count":9}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1043789","id":"1043789"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1043789/responses","id":"1043789"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1043789/healthservices","id":"1043789"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1043789/tags","id":"1043789"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rwdlp_307","id":"RWDLP_307","score":2},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/annoyed","id":"annoyed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20frustrated","id":"very frustrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appointments","id":"appointments"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care%20review","id":"care review"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/consultant%20attitude","id":"Consultant Attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disillusioned","id":"disillusioned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20impressed","id":"not impressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/patient%20information","id":"patient information"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/records","id":"records"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/time%20wasted","id":"time wasted"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/booking%20in","id":"booking in"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wasted%20resources","id":"wasted resources"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1045883","id":"1045883"}]},{"id":1043792,"author":"Stantheman","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"All in all brilliant nurses and doctors","body":"After waking up in excruciating pain my doctor sent me to hospital where after numerous tests including x Ray and ct scan I was diagnosed with acute appendicitis.  \r\nI was booked in for the operation on Tues but thankfully the surgeons were extremely busy and decided to give me antibiotics instead.  \r\nThe surgeon spoke with me on Tues and we agreed to keep treating me with the antibiotics and see how it went.
