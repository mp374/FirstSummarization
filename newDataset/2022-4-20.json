Not even a doctor. Of course I was very annoyed as this particular surgery has a history of not answering to patients.\nI challenged the staff member as to why. \"We could have been dealing with patients\" was the response. I replied \"were there any patients\"? \"sometimes there are\" came the reply. \nNervous smirking and scratching the  back of one's neck are often associated with displacing nervous energy when being economical with the truth.\nA surgery with such a negative reputation would do well to resolve the issues. The same ones that have previously drawn the attention of the local MP.\nI was also disappointed with the waiting time of two weeks for a pointless phone call then a hard push from the staff member  to call I Heart.\n Also interesting that last week I called dozens of times with no answer. My wife, who is not a patient called for me on her phone. Answered immediately. New patients are accepted! Deliberate? You decide.\nWe pay taxes to maintain our health not to provide jobs for people whose sole intention is to avoid the patient at all costs.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-04-19T11:04:20","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-04-20T06:46:59","readBy":[{"name":"BHF Surgery, Lundwood","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/932617","id":"932617"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/932617/responses","id":"932617"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/932617/healthservices","id":"932617"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/932617/tags","id":"932617"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/y05364","id":"Y05364","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/annoyed","id":"annoyed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disappointed","id":"disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nervous","id":"nervous"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/heart","id":"heart"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/neck","id":"neck"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pointless","id":"pointless"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20disappointed","id":"very disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doing%20well","id":"doing well"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/932976","id":"932976"}]},{"id":932616,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Best to email to get an appointment ","body":"Trying to call the surgery is not a good option got cut off twice after 20min wait.

Please keep up the good work.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-04-19T18:24:21","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2022-04-20T06:54:23","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/932622","id":"932622"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/932622/responses","id":"932622"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/932622/healthservices","id":"932622"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/932622/tags","id":"932622"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rxq","id":"RXQ","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/aftercare","id":"aftercare"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/brilliant","id":"brilliant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good","id":"good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/great","id":"great"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hip","id":"hip"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hip%20replacement","id":"hip replacement"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/in%20pain","id":"in pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mobility","id":"mobility"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20good","id":"not good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/operation","id":"operation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/physio","id":"physio"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/relief","id":"relief"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appreciated","id":"appreciated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wonderful","id":"wonderful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doing%20well","id":"doing well"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20home","id":"at home"}]},{"id":932624,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"No compassion ","body":"Our family members have been registered with this surgery since birth.

I believe due to the standards and management of her care and wellbeing she has got worse instead of better and her mental health has dropped like a stone.  \r\nToday was the last straw !  \r\nShe’s now been in 3 wards due to bed shortages and also spent over 26 hours on a trolley bed on admission without anyone diagnosing her problems or even putting her on a drip even though she was dehydrated and not eaten for days before.  \r\nShe’s still not eating much but today asked me to bring her up some lemon sole 🐟 from my local restaurant.  \r\nI got the guys who I know to make and pack it specially and took it up. She was so looking forward to it.  \r\nIt’s was obviously a bit cold, they have a ward kitchen with a microwave. So I asked very politely and backed it up with stating her diet and eating habits over 9 weeks and asked if I could get a wee plate and heat it up in the microwave?  \r\nIt would fairly cheer her up even a mouth full or a taste ?  \r\nAn auxiliary and three nurses couldn’t make the decision about the use of a microwave for 2 minutes. They had to ask whoever was in charge and they said no because it was a health and safety issue 🙄 after one said it shouldn’t be a problem.  \r\nI was flabbergasted and blew my top saying just get her ready I’m taking her home right now.  \r\nShe could be on her death bed, hasn’t eaten for 9 weeks, asked me to bring her something up she fancied to eat, which is a miracle in itself, and someone comes up with this stupid decision  \r\nIn 10 weeks since admission the care she has had in that hospital has been a joke.  \r\nNo one has a clue and the management of patients and staff is unbelievably poor.  \r\nAll nice folk but no coordination management of systems that work.  \r\nI’ll be glad to get her out of there ASAP  \r\nSomeone needs to have a serious look at how that hospital is run to benefit the patients.  \r\nFrom admission to getting out it’s a farce compared to what used to be a great and caring Health Service.  \r\nYou cannot get though to speak to anyone the phones ring out for hours.  \r\nWhen you do speak to someone no one passes on your messages to senior staff or clinicians who you also cannot get in front off as no one in the wards seem to know who’s on or off as they rotate every two weeks. They don’t know the secretaries phone numbers to make appointments to see your mum's consultant.  \r\nThe senior nursing staff yes, sympathetically listen but then nothing happens.  \r\nFrom my experience a patient is stuck in a wee room with a crap TV and get a visit every 4 hours or so when a box needs ticked on a form.  \r\nThat to me is the extent of patient interaction and care. They follow what is written down by an unseen consultant who you cannot contact.  \r\nI believe my mothers chances of surviving and having any decent standard of life or wellbeing has dramatically been affected by lack of professionalism, logistics, management, bureaucracy and ultimately poor poor care for the patient.  \r\nMost of all she’s suffered due to inept communication and late diagnosis and prognosis of her condition.  \r\nI hope all I say helps her and others as I feel standards have dropped appallingly.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-04-18T18:19:51.0433333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-04-20T09:47:06.107","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":11},{"name":"East Renfrewshire Health & Social Care Partnership","count":2},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2022)","count":1},{"name":"Scottish Government","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/932230","id":"932230"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/932230/responses","id":"932230"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/932230/healthservices","id":"932230"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/932230/tags","id":"932230"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sj9qe-hspct","id":"sj9qe-hspct","score":1},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20listened%20to","id":"not listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/shocked","id":"shocked"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/should%20listen","id":"Should listen"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appointments","id":"appointments"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/consultants%20should%20listen","id":"Consultants should listen"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/death","id":"death"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dehydrated","id":"dehydrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diagnosis","id":"diagnosis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diet","id":"diet"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disrespected","id":"disrespected"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/drip","id":"drip"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/end%20of%20life","id":"end of life"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/food","id":"food"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/management","id":"management"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mismanagement","id":"mismanagement"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mistakes","id":"mistakes"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/organisation","id":"organisation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/palliative","id":"palliative"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/phone%20calls","id":"phone calls"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professionalism","id":"professionalism"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/respect%20&%20dignity","id":"respect & dignity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/systems","id":"systems"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassion","id":"compassion"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pharmacy%20delays","id":"pharmacy delays"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sad%20angry","id":"sad angry"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/human%20interaction","id":"human interaction"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/slow%20diagnosis","id":"slow diagnosis"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/934836","id":"934836"}]},{"id":932691,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Absolute Rubbish ","body":"Terrible practice.

You cannot keep blaming a telephone system for your staff actively putting down the phone! This has been going on for well over a year now. \n- Reception staff are sometimes not helpful and it feels as if you are bothering them. \n- Upon call back, doctors do not seem to even look at your records before hand and ask you to explain everything from scratch.  Bring up patient records before you call.\n- When you have a booked face to face appointment, you are never seen on time.  You are usually waiting at least 30mins. Once waited nearly 2 hours!

After 4 and a half hours of waiting I was taken in and put on a trolley bed and examined. A nurse came to me to take bloods so I put out my left hand. As I have very good veins I thought nothing of it. The next thing I knew the needle really hurt me, and when I looked it was a canula. I asked why a canula had been put right in the middle of my arm where it bends and why I hadn't been told they were putting a cannula in or even been asked.  \r\nAs it was I was admitted to MSU for 10 days and that cannula hurt me, especially when the nurses were using it. The nurses in there were so busy that they couldn't even change the site of the cannula, and I didn't want to push them as I could see how busy and short staffed they were. When I was transferred to a Ward eventually 10 days later it came up as a lump and I was in so much pain. The nurse kindly changed the site of the canula.  \r\nI was discharged 19 days later and had to go to out patients for another blood test. The Phlebotomist could not use the vein which I had been using without any problem for several years as it had gone so hard. They had to use the other hand and told me not to use that very hand for blood test for several weeks as it needed to be rested.  \r\nIt's a good thing that I have very good veins otherwise I would have had problems giving a bloods in future and I hope no one gets treated the same way as I did. That site still hurts me when I touch it 40 days later. I am a diabetic and suffering from Heart failure and I have had double organ transplants, so I have had several cannulas and blood tests over the years without a problem whatsoever.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-04-18T22:22:20.0533333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-04-20T10:37:03.607","readBy":[{"name":"North West Anglia NHS Foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/932264","id":"932264"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/932264/responses","id":"932264"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/932264/healthservices","id":"932264"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/932264/tags","id":"932264"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rgn80-ae","id":"RGN80-ae","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ignored","id":"ignored"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/arm","id":"arm"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20test","id":"blood test"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hungry","id":"hungry"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/in%20pain","id":"in pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/long%20wait","id":"long wait"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lump","id":"lump"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/some%20nurses","id":"some nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/veins","id":"veins"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/canula%20fitting","id":"canula fitting"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/932738","id":"932738"}]},{"id":932698,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"What a poor practice","body":"You spend up to 2 hours getting through 35 minutes getting in to the que then up to an hour and 15 minutes to get through to recpetionists.\n\nYou cant get a face to face appointment unless the doctor brings you in after a phone appointment if you have no phone your out of luck here \n\nWhen doctors forget to call ypu back or you have a complaint the fob you off to email them.\n\nNo practice manager onsite and they wont even cal them so you can talk to them. very unprofessional so dont hold hopes on complaint\n\nBesides the actual doctors and nurses who are polite and professional. \n the receptionists ask us to treat them with respect but treat you like dirt and when your not happy say calm down dont have a go or you wil not be served.

The GPS are knowledgeable and explain things well and do genuinely want to help you. However, the thing that lets this practice down is it’s appointment availability and reception team. The team seem nice and frustrated at some of the systems, however when you’re spending days in the condition you are in before you’re even getting an appointment isn’t acceptable. Calling the practice at 8:00 on the dot is a ritual in the morning when you are sick, even if you are there a second after 8 the main menu will be slow and you’ll be about 15 in the queue somehow. And even though it’s 8:00 and the practice has just opened after 20 mins on hold your greeted with the normal “we don’t have any appointments available anymore, please fill in our online e-consult form” which while is a good enough system it makes no attempt to explain to the person filling it out how it’s triaged, or how it’s even handled. An e-consult form is good for people with good digital literacy but doesn’t reassure people, doesn’t make it so the person is less scared or anxious about going into the surgery for whatever they are going in for. The surgery in the last few years has gone from one I’m proud of going too to now one I dread calling, one I dread going too as the wait times are long and unexplained at times. The gps have good bedside manner, they make you calmer and less scared for the situation you’re in. However the reception team seem to fall down on it, I don’t want to bring anyone down but it’s just not good enough in my opinion. I really hope the surgery can sort out their appointment system as most people I talk too have the same opinion, the surgery is good but falls down on basic service standards.

The surgery went fine, I recommend the surgical team.  \r\nThe hospital environment and nursing care was abysmal. I was not aware that all wards at York Hospital are mixed sex, even for gynaecological and breast cancer surgery. I was shocked to be on a mixed sex ward, with men free to wander into the female bay and men using a female lavatory. One night a man, who had entered the female bay several times during the day, came into the female area and assaulted one of the women, threatened the rest and attacked nursing staff. I did not feel that I was in a safe environment. If I had known in advance that all wards were mixed sex, I would have requested a different hospital or had to have my urgent operation at a private hospital. In addition, I was given the wrong I.V. antibiotics and refused pain relief related to this, discharged with a dressing marked with the extent of post-surgery infection. My dressing wasn’t changed whilst I was in hospital and I was not given any dressings to take home. There did not appear to be any shower facilities on the ward. I left hospital feeling dirty and infected. I was given conflicting information regarding food, for 2 days I was told that I should have brought my own food in with me. I was provided with food on my last day.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-04-19T11:25:15.2966667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-04-20T11:28:42.143","readBy":[{"name":"York and Scarborough Teaching Hospital NHS Foundation Trust","count":2},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2022)","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/932358","id":"932358"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/932358/responses","id":"932358"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/932358/healthservices","id":"932358"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/932358/tags","id":"932358"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rcb55_300","id":"RCB55_300","score":1},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/worried","id":"worried"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/administering%20medication","id":"administering medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/antibiotics","id":"antibiotics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/catering","id":"catering"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cleanliness","id":"cleanliness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/discharge","id":"discharge"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dressings","id":"dressings"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/food","id":"food"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/going%20home","id":"going home"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gynaeocology","id":"gynaeocology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/infection","id":"infection"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nursing%20care","id":"nursing care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain%20relief","id":"pain relief"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/patient%20safety","id":"patient safety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/security","id":"security"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/showers","id":"showers"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgical%20team","id":"surgical team"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/toilets","id":"toilets"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ward%20environment","id":"Ward environment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unsafe","id":"unsafe"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/932772","id":"932772"}]},{"id":932481,"author":"Niamhh1","authorRoleId":8,"authorRole":"a staff member posting for a patient/service user","title":"Communication is great","body":"Lurgan hospital is so peaceful and I feel as though the nurses are so so caring, they always do their very best and god help them as they are so over worked.

In the end, I have two different bacteria infections and glandular fever but that took a while to figure out.  \r\nI called my GP multiple times to let them know the antibiotics weren’t working (not surprising since I actually had a viral infection) and was told to just keep pushing through.  \r\nI ended up in Ninewells A&E after my fever got out of control and I kept vomiting. A&E itself was hell. I was retching and feeling my fever spiking, watching doctors walk back and forth. After 3 hours, I was finally seen by a doctor. They essentially told me the same thing: Go home and suffer.  \r\nTwo days later and I can’t swallow or breathe. I went back to Ninewells A&E. They said they were very busy. When I arrived there were 5 people waiting including me. It took them over 5 hours to see us. At one point, a woman in a wheelchair asked for help going to the toilet and the nurse asked what was wrong with her in a rude tone.  \r\nI end up admitted to ward 5 at Ninewells. While on the admissions ward, I overheard staff talking about how A&E had only run half the blood panels they should have.  \r\nThey discharged me the next day before my blood work came back and with exactly the same treatment plan as before.  \r\nAt the advice of 111, I was back in hospital (this time at Victoria Kirkcaldy) in less than 12 hours - once again unable to take my medicine, unable to swallow and my fever creeping up. I saw a very good Out of Hours nurse and then was sent to wait in A&E. I was seated on a bench beside the loudest door imaginable from 3am to 5am. In that time, I listened to staff joke about not washing their hands between seeing patients and eating food and how the they’d had an easy night. By the time I was allowed to lie down (I say allowed because I was seated directly across from an empty bay) I was “dreaming In confetti” - micro sleeps with very vivid dreams.  \r\nThe nurses at every step have been kind and attentive but the doctors just did not seem to care. They have their minds filled with the heart attack patients and the “serious” stuff. They forget that when a person can’t sleep, it takes about 2 days for the hallucinations to start; that not eating can cause serious complications in combination with some medicines; that being at 7/10 pain for 7 days in a row is so bad for health.  \r\nThe senior doctor who is going to make the decision to discharge me in about an hour didn’t even touch my throat or ask me if I was eating. He looked in my mouth (without a torch) and declared good enough. It was callous.  \r\nI realise that I am not literally dying but I have reached the point where my symptoms run the risk of inflicting unnecessary and long lasting effects.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-04-19T11:25:58.8133333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-04-20T12:02:07.467","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Tayside","count":17},{"name":"NHS Fife","count":11},{"name":"Fife Health & Social Care Partnership","count":3},{"name":"Office of Murdo Fraser, MSP for Mid Scotland & Fife","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/932359","id":"932359"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/932359/responses","id":"932359"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/932359/healthservices","id":"932359"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/932359/tags","id":"932359"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/f704h_180","id":"F704H_180","score":2},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/t101h_180","id":"T101H_180","score":2},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20being%20listened%20to","id":"not being listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/accident%20&%20emergency","id":"accident & emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/antibiotics","id":"antibiotics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20tests","id":"blood tests"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/depressed","id":"depressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/despair","id":"despair"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctors","id":"doctors"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fever","id":"fever"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/glandular%20fever","id":"glandular fever"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gp","id":"GP"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/long%20wait","id":"long wait"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/noisy","id":"noisy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/throat","id":"throat"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tonsillitis","id":"tonsillitis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment%20planning","id":"treatment planning"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vomiting","id":"vomiting"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/a&e%20care","id":"A&E care"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/932761","id":"932761"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/934808","id":"934808"}]},{"id":932376,"author":"Disneyfan16","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Effective antiviral treatment","body":"Having Covid is scary for me as a family member died from Covid.

It felt like a heavy cold and sore throat. Towards day 6 had severe swollen knee and joint pain. My GP prescribed me strong arthritic medication (over the phone) on the Friday (day 9) on the basis I went in for bloods on the Monday. By Sunday I was in excruciating pain and went to Monklands hospital where they found kidney stones had blocked my urethra and they quickly put a stent in. My infection markers were nearly 400, high blood SATS and they discovered sepsis. Infection spread into my chest and blood cultures were taken to fight infection in kidney. This went on for two weeks in hospital.  \r\nI was released with oral antibiotics and told the hospital would be in touch to arrange stent removal and kidney stones lasers. After a week being out I had a flare up of joint pain in my ankle and pain in bladder area. I went to the hospital where they found I had a UTI which they treated with antibiotics. I was kept in for a week. On release I was told I would receive a letter regarding the stent removal. I tried to contact the hospital several times to no avail. I now have another UTI with more antibiotics and am in constant pain and discomfort.  \r\nI managed to speak to a GP today who has written to the hospital regarding the stent which has now been in for over 9 weeks now and seems to be causing recurring infection. I never received a letter from the hospital to help me contact the correct department. They don’t have my details is what I have been told. Shouldn’t the hospital be contacting me to have this removed so the stones can be removed also? Who is monitoring my infection levels and the effectiveness of the antibiotics? Why am I not on the system? I feel very badly let down and alone. I am in constant discomfort and can’t get well as I am having recurring infections caused by the stent.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-04-19T21:41:02.8866667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-04-20T14:01:27.247","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lanarkshire","count":4},{"name":"Partnership for Change","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/932488","id":"932488"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/932488/responses","id":"932488"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/932488/healthservices","id":"932488"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/932488/tags","id":"932488"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l106h_101","id":"L106H_101","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/badly%20let%20down","id":"badly let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scared","id":"scared"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/alone","id":"alone"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/antibiotics","id":"antibiotics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bladder","id":"bladder"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care%20on%20the%20ward","id":"Care on the ward"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication%20between%20services","id":"communication between services"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/follow%20up%20care","id":"Follow up care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/in%20pain","id":"in pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/infection","id":"infection"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/joint%20pain","id":"joint pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kidney","id":"kidney"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/laboratory","id":"laboratory"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/monitoring","id":"monitoring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/removal%20of%20kidney","id":"Removal of kidney"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sepsis","id":"sepsis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stent","id":"stent"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/uti","id":"uti"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid","id":"covid"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/forgotten%20about","id":"forgotten about"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kidney%20stones","id":"kidney stones"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%2019","id":"covid 19"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/932804","id":"932804"}]},{"id":932490,"author":"Pamela Mc","authorRoleId":4,"authorRole":"a relative","title":"Outstanding care for my mother in law","body":"I just want to thank all staff in Ward 5 at Wishaw General Hospital.

I do not use the word outstanding lightly or often.  \r\nThere is however no other word to describe this amazing ward and all it’s staff.  \r\nThe standard of care was exceptional and Mum made a remarkable recovery and is now in a private nursing home.  \r\nThe CCU staff treated Mum with respect and dignity and were very supportive to my brother and me in every way possible.  \r\nVery special people work very hard in this ward and we would like to extend a huge thank you and award performance as OUTSTANDING.  \r\nMum was moved to B3 awaiting discharge to a nursing home. While I have no complaints about nursing care, this ward lacks the reassuring ambience of CCU. Mum was anxious during her stay in B3 because of minor issues having experienced excellence in CCU where she felt safe.  \r\nDischarge from B3 was poor, resulting in obstacles being presented to our mother’s move to a nursing home subsequent to discharge. This was mainly due to poor administration . Discharge felt like as long as she was gone from B3 they didn’t care what happened next.  \r\nThis was unlike CCU who talked to her and us helping to prepare her for a permanent bed in the nursing home of her choice.  \r\nMy mother had been seriously ill and was assessed as needing 24 hour nursing care yet a male member of staff offered an ultimatum that she went that day to a particular nursing home or she was left home where there no care package in place.  \r\nMum would not have agreed to discharge at that point as it presented a temporary bed instead of smooth discharge to her choice of home. It also caused double up of isolation periods etc at a traumatic time when she was dealing with not returning to her own home again. On reflection this was unacceptable treatment of a vulnerable adult.  \r\nThat said from paramedics in her home to each individual person who took care of her Thank You.  \r\nAntrim Area hospital is very clean and well presented. Every effort is taken to ensure safety of everyone including visitors.  \r\nFrom receptionist to support staff met on corridor all were helpful and caring.  \r\nNo words can express our gratitude for Mums remarkable recovery which was mainly down to CCU .  \r\nMy overall comment on CCU is a team of wonderful , friendly professional people who are well managed with an evident people over policy approach.

As the weeks went by her local consultant talked about meds and treatment. One of the meds was for constipation. This medicine was supposed to be changed. It was supplied by our local hospital by our local consultant. When we arrived home the meds for constipation was the same. I realised that our local consultant hadn't checked her medical notes?  \r\nThere was a few times my wife was taken to our local hospital for treatment and scans. One particular night my wife phoned me and said she needed to go to the toilet. I said to press the assistant button by the side of your bed. She said she couldn't as she was locked in a store room.  \r\nFriends, we were personally disgusted at some of our so-called local hospital care and after home palliative care. As she was going through all the different cycles of treatment we kept our medical system up to date with her sickness, pains etc each day and week.  \r\nIn August her local consultant phoned to have a conversation about her illness. She was assured treatment was working and going well. Three nights later she went to go to bathroom the power of her legs left her. She was brought in to hospital and by Sunday morning she was paralysed. Her consultant said that they could not understand why her treatment stopped working.  \r\nFriends, I am no doctor but full blood counts show a lot of TL Cells etc. Full blood tests were done. One minute the treatment was going to continue and then the next it was withdrawn. So sadly, we got the bad news nothing more can be done.  \r\nI had my wife home for 13 weeks in the living room. I had to explain to nurses and carers that she had two fractures, one on each shoulder, and was paralysed. It came across to me that no one read her medical notes. If they had of, they would have known. The local nurse asked me could my wife do without a Catheter. I was informed that they don't have time to read her medical notes. How can anyone care for a person if they don't know what wrong? I even requested extra-large bed pads, but I was informed they only get what's available. That’s unreal and unbelievable.  \r\nI requested a urine test because the strong smell of the urine and its colour indicated an infection. I was informed by our local nurse that our local GP said he didn't want to do one so basically he refused a urine test.  \r\nA week later she becomes very unwell and had to go into our local hospital for treatment of Urosepsis. Seven hours later I received a medical phone call saying they are stopping the special drug. I said that she wasn't getting much of a chance just seven hours? Of course, I was advised that she had got cancer. I said my wife is in for the treatment of Urosepsis. At that time her cancer levels were normal.  \r\nI have had a poor experience of the medical system from day one. We requested a simple hair wash. Three weeks later she asked when is her hair going to get washed? I said love I will do it myself she smiled and said thank you.  \r\nFriends has anyone went through a similar experience of being let down by the system as we were? Hopefully your will have had a much-needed hair wash and simple things like dry hygiene wipes. We didn’t get those basic but essential things.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-04-20T08:34:19.5766667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-04-20T15:03:02.743","readBy":[{"name":"Southern Health and Social Care Trust","count":15},{"name":"Ulster University, MBBS (Medicine) 2021","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/932644","id":"932644"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/932644/responses","id":"932644"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/932644/healthservices","id":"932644"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/932644/tags","id":"932644"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_32024_101","id":"ZT003_32024_101","score":2},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_32024-r4","id":"ZT003_32024-r4","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003-lurgan-dn","id":"zt003-lurgan-dn","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood","id":"blood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20tests","id":"blood tests"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cancer","id":"cancer"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/catheter","id":"catheter"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/constipation","id":"constipation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/drug","id":"drug"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/incontinence%20pads","id":"incontinence pads"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/infection","id":"infection"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/injection","id":"injection"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/legs","id":"legs"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medical%20records","id":"medical records"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/myeloma","id":"myeloma"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/palliative","id":"palliative"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/paralysed","id":"paralysed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/shoulder","id":"shoulder"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sickness","id":"sickness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/test","id":"test"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tests","id":"tests"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/urine%20test","id":"urine test"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/haircare","id":"haircare"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/some%20staff%20members","id":"some staff members"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/933038","id":"933038"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/934522","id":"934522"}]},{"id":930927,"author":"dollycat47","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"GPOOH, 999 call handler and ambulance crew","body":"Unfortunately I dont have all the staff names who helped us as it was a very stressful time.&nbsp; My father-in-law became unwell, we called the out of hours GP service and had an almost immediate call back from a kind and caring GP - he also called back later that evening to check on things even though he had called an ambulance to come out to us/take over the care.&nbsp; Whilst waiting on this my father in law deteriorated, we therefore called 999 services who remained calm and talked us through everything until the ambulances arrived.&nbsp; The 2 crews that came were professional, respectful and so courteous to us.&nbsp; One was called Stevie, sorry I am unsure of the ladies and 2 other gentlmens names.

I only needed their support until I was put in permanent accommodation as I suffer from severe mental health problems. I was taking daily tablets and admin said that they were unable to help me.

Despite remonstrations by ambulance staff seeking urgent care for stroke I had to go into Lincoln A&E for assessment, as this was apparently the quickest way to get admission to the Stroke Unit.  \r\nI was seen by a doctor after some 1.5 to 2 hrs, who confirmed likely stroke, causing balance, vision and nausea problems, caused by a clot which would not have shown on the CT. I was given a large aspirin and held awaiting a bed on the stroke unit. Finally taken to stroke unit at approx 22:45.  \r\nOnce on the stroke unit, care and treatment was carried out to perfection, and my condition improved apace. OT and physio assessments fully and timely performed. I had a MRI scan, and was discharged with ongoing medication last Friday, with follow-up review in 6 - 8 weeks.  \r\nI can only praise both Grantham A&E and Lincoln Stroke Unit for their care and attention. However, it could not be clearer to see that the time taken to get treatment was excessive and the lack of timely ambulance home service was unacceptable. With such shortage of resources at Lincoln County, the expanding population in the Grantham area, and delays in transportation, the Stroke Unit at Grantham should be reinstated as a matter of urgency.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-04-20T10:26:04.47","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-04-20T15:38:26.507","readBy":[{"name":"United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust","count":11},{"name":"East Midlands Ambulance Service","count":1},{"name":"The Stroke Association","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/932683","id":"932683"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/932683/responses","id":"932683"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/932683/healthservices","id":"932683"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/932683/tags","id":"932683"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rwdda","id":"RWDDA","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rwdda_180","id":"RWDDA_180","score":3},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rwdlp_180","id":"RWDLP_180","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rwdlp-xray","id":"rwdlp-xray","score":4},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rx9-emergency","id":"RX9-emergency","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frustrated","id":"frustrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/accident%20&%20emergency","id":"accident & emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/balance","id":"balance"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breathing","id":"breathing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cheek","id":"cheek"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ct","id":"ct"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ct%20scan","id":"CT scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dizzy","id":"dizzy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ecg","id":"ecg"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/long%20wait","id":"long wait"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mri%20scan","id":"MRI scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nausea","id":"nausea"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/numbness","id":"numbness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ot","id":"ot"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/physio","id":"physio"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stroke","id":"stroke"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stroke%20unit","id":"stroke unit"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unwell","id":"unwell"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vision","id":"vision"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ambulance%20response","id":"ambulance response"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/933036","id":"933036"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/933037","id":"933037"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/933078","id":"933078"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/934473","id":"934473"}]},{"id":932806,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Impossible to get appoinment","body":"I called at 8am received a call back at 10.30 saying there were no appointments, I asked to see the out of hours GP and they told me to fill out a form after 2pm.
