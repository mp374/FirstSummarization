[{"id":780981,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Excellent care","body":"I recently had to give birth without my partner because we were waiting for the results of a covid test. The midwives were very kind and reassuring before, throughout and after the birth. When there was a problem with the isolation room I was in initially they found me another room and took care to ensure I was comfortable there and had calm and privacy during early labour. They later acted very promptly when there were concerns over my baby's heart rate. Even when the situation looked more urgent and lots of staff were in the room doing different things to me, someone would always respond to my questions  and all the drs and midwives treated me with dignity and respect, explaining what they were doing. I also felt that during the different stages of labour the midwives listened carefully to my description of what was happening even when it didn't match with their assessment of my contractions. In the end my daughter was delivered naturally and safely just as I was about to be taken for an emergency c section. The midwife who looked after me following the birth was very conscious of the fact that I was without my husband and offered to take photos of me and the baby so that I could send them to him. I am very grateful for the way all the staff helped to mitigate what could have been a very scary and negative experience.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-08-14T14:13:38","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-08-15T10:47:42","readBy":[{"name":"Sandwell and West Birmingham Hospitals NHS Trust","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/780981","id":"780981"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/780981/responses","id":"780981"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/780981/healthservices","id":"780981"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/780981/tags","id":"780981"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rxk02","id":"RXK02","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/birth","id":"birth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/c%20section","id":"c section"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/contractions","id":"contractions"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency","id":"emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/heart","id":"heart"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/heart%20rate","id":"heart rate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helped","id":"helped"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/isolation","id":"isolation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/labour","id":"labour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/midwives","id":"midwives"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/test","id":"test"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/859265","id":"859265"}]},{"id":780982,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Good carer and autism awareness","body":"This surgery has a positive attitude towards supporting me as a carer and my daughter who has complex autism.

No information provided about waiting time. Staff discussed patients in voices loud enough to be heard in the waiting room. Two patients left against medical advice after waiting for hours without being seen. Finally seen by a very caring competent doctor from another department who stopped the bleeding and provided advice about what to do over the next few days.

I am hoping this was a particularly busy afternoon/evening and that the care provided in A&E is usually better.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-08-14T21:46:59","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-08-15T14:45:49","readBy":[{"name":"East Kent Hospitals University NHS Foundation Trust","count":2}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/780995","id":"780995"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/780995/responses","id":"780995"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/780995/healthservices","id":"780995"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/780995/tags","id":"780995"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rvv01","id":"RVV01","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bleeding","id":"bleeding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency","id":"emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/781724","id":"781724"}]},{"id":781000,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Great improvement ","body":"I used the new online service two days ago and I booked a phone consultation which I received in just a few hours.

appreciate that these are unprecedented times etc but the set up to get even a phone appointment is ridiculous and baffling.

They could literally take a phone number and offer to call back at the first available opportunity or have an online system or... something. So, in the end, I didn't even speak to a doctor from the practice, but someone in Morley (who are presumably working extended hours to cover, apparently beyond Leigh View). \n\nTo be honest, this sounds kind of trivial.

The wounds were weeping and there was a reddened area across the foot which was hot and I was struggling to weight near.\n\nBefore entering I was asked if I was experiencing any Covid19 symptoms, which I was not. I provided a history and whilst doing so my temperature was taken. \n\nMy temperature was 38.2, so I was told immediately to leave and recommended that I book in for a Covid test. I queried my concerns about infection and both medics queried whether either had touched the area by way of examination. They both acknowledged they hadn’t, but said they looked absolutely fine and the priority was to book a Covid19 test and self isolate.\n\nMy temperature rose further through night, but dropped the following morning. My ankle pain has worsened and I was unable to put any weight on one foot at all.\n\nI attended A&E where they identified immediately that the there was progressive cellulitis that required immediate treatment with anti-biotic, as left untreated it could develop into sepsis. \n\nWhilst I appreciate we in the midst of a pandemic (and I went for a test as a precaution), it was clear that my high temperature triggered a Covid concern, when the situation in front of the medics was one where infection was the obvious explanation for the high temperature.\n\nThe visit was also shortly before closing, which I was reminded of, and the exact words used were “you’ve got a temperature, so the best advice we can give is to get away from us as quickly as you can and also go and get yourself tested and self-isolate.”\n\nHad I relied upon the advice, I would not have sought further medical advice and would have remained at home for 10 days whilst infection spread in my body.\n\nTrying to relieve the burden from the front line professionals in A&E was not beneficial to me, or them, on this occasion. Advice from the A&E professionals was to “walk past the walk-in” in future and go straight to them.

They specialise in working against patients rather that working with or even for their patients. Not only are they rude and care less about human but they also come up with the most senseless things ever. For example, they refuse to accept a hand delivered letter for one of the doctors which contained patient medical information from another medical consultant. Their reason was “because of Covid”. Ask what if the postman delivered it? Their response was it will go through screening. I understand they have to take precaution but so am I and a sensible one too. Not that it’s guaranteed the postman is covid free. My son needed an emergency inhaler due to asthma, he was told by the receptionist to complete a repeated prescription form which takes 2 days. I also had to wait 2 days to get a simple information that could have been provided by the receptionist. The appointment system only favours the unemployed. The staff just makes it impossible in every way for any service patient need. They are quick to refer you to somewhere else like the chemist or other health centres. This is not right. Something must be done. These people need training on how to relate to human needs and some customer service skills. \nThe doctors on the other hand are very good once you get to see or speak to them.

I said no because it was late to wake the neighbours and the chemists were closed.

However, the service failed to acknowledge this and other failings (including not responding to me when I was at crisis point) which contributed further to a lack of trust and respect between all parties.  \r\nIn particular the doctor I was under continued for several years with an antagonistic and accusatory approach, was dismissive of anything I had to say, delayed a referral by almost two years, cancelled CPN input by way of ultimatum and dismissed the advice of another doctor after seeking their opinion. This doctor went on to falsely claim I was a danger to my child saying a referral would have to be made to Child Protective Services; thankfully this wasn’t followed through.  \r\nFrequently they would apply labels and make statements which were a completely inaccurate portrayal of me or my circumstances. This was often played out in front of other staff members which helped give leverage to the false claims and statements. This in turn led to the wider team including management acting as though they have a bunker mentality where it seemed to me like defending their colleagues was more important than my welfare as a patient or acknowledging previous mistakes/shortcomings.  \r\nSadly the only consistency I have observed from this service has been their the woeful underperformance in recent years, perhaps reflected in their inability to timeously update their outdated operating procedures.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-08-10T14:50:58.5733333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-08-17T09:20:01.693","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Ayrshire & Arran","count":14},{"name":"North Ayrshire Health & Social Care Partnership","count":12},{"name":"NHS Education for Scotland","count":1},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":1},{"name":"Scottish Recovery Network","count":1},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2020)","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/780105","id":"780105"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/780105/responses","id":"780105"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/780105/healthservices","id":"780105"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/780105/tags","id":"780105"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/a214h","id":"A214H","score":1},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/nahscp-community-mh","id":"nahscp-community-mh","score":1},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/crisis","id":"crisis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ignored","id":"ignored"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cpn","id":"cpn"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dismissed","id":"dismissed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/management","id":"management"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/psychiatrist","id":"psychiatrist"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/psychologist","id":"psychologist"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/781579","id":"781579"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/782646","id":"782646"}]},{"id":780135,"author":"LINN","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Misdiagnosed for years","body":"Misdiagnosed for years when suffering low thyroid.  \r\nAlso went to surgery with skin issues for 3 years and during this time seen by a specialist and the person in question, who is no longer there, told me \"do not come back there is nothing we can do\".  \r\nLater after persisting and getting a referral for a biopsy, was diagnosed with skin sarcoidosis, in January 2020.

Not once did I get notes on myself, no little maternity book etc. Then I had meetings with maternity staff at the Royal (who were angels) - where I was sent unnecessarily, I assume because my BMI was high the health centre nurse thought I was high risk.  \r\nHowever, then I got transferred finally to Renfrewshire perhaps 6 months down the line where I was given a midwife who was to remain mines until I gave birth -really clicked with this one! They were very Zen and we bonded. To then be given over to another midwife who to put it frank it seemed couldn't be arsed.  \r\nMessed around by junior doctors at maternity services at RAH - told I would be induced at 38 weeks because baby was growing rapid, to then be told no I wouldn't be getting induced because the baby was then measuring small. To then come back and be told I would be induced however the consultant (finally got to meet) wanted the community midwife to do a sweep of which she refused - can I also reiterate that all \"information\" given by junior docs was none, nothing on induction, no informed consent on my part until I spoke with the consultant which I asked for otherwise would have been given another junior.  \r\nFast forward to my induction - maternity staff...AMAZING!! I can not praise the maternity staff at RAH enough. I was taken to labour suite around 12 after 3 pessaries over the necessary time etc. The midwife I had until shift change was lovely, bright and bubbly. However, my midwife for the Nightshift!! What an absolute angel! I will forever be thankful for their calm, informative and professional nature. The epitome of a midwife with added banter! I genuinely cannot praise this staff member enough. However, my labour was very long and this midwife had to leave just as everything was going wrong. Dilated fully then taken for a C-section. Again, the anaesthetic nurse - great at her job. Helped to calm my poor partner down. The anaesthetist threw the spinal in like a champ! Instant relieve. All the perioperative staff were great especially when I lost a lot of blood, so professional and astute. Dr Robbins, again what a lovely man -such a shame he has retired.  \r\nPost op - I don't remember much but I was unwell and had a lot of drugs and blood transfusions. The staff were accomodating.  \r\nUp the ward - left to my own devices, staff pleasant, some less so. No aftercare on c section, no guidelines or booklets about do's and don'ts. The Consultant who eventually discharged me, lovely mannerisms, spoke clearly, concisely and informatively to me.  \r\nOn return home after removal of my stitch my wound dehisced at several areas, serous fluid and blood all over my living room. Staff at maternity line so unhelpful and on attendance a very junior doc had a quick look and popped a few paper stitches over my leaking, gaping wound and sent me on my merry way. Appalled. The community midwives tried to help but were not so sure about wound management, having an already massive case load! However, perhaps a wee bit of training may help them if the services could provide!  \r\nThanks goodness for my practice nurse on the management of my wound.  \r\nOverall, I am happy with my care all that mattered to me was that my baby was born safely. However, I feel maternity services could benefit with debriefs including patients after traumatic events/births after discharge. This would benefit any potential PTSD issues. Which is something I raised with a junior doctor about my apprehension to an induced birth due to increased risk of traumatic births, haemorrhage etc. However, I was dismissed. Luckily I was more traumatised by my gaping wound than my birth story. There is many training opportunities required. However, staffing needs improved and in my opinion the pay needs increased! Thankful for the NHS.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-08-13T20:24:32.1833333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-08-17T09:39:21.733","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":10},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/780752","id":"780752"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/780752/responses","id":"780752"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/780752/healthservices","id":"780752"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/780752/tags","id":"780752"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/c418h_501","id":"C418H_501","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/c418h-commaternityunit","id":"c418h-commaternityunit","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/g108h_501","id":"G108H_501","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sj9-general-practices","id":"sj9-general-practices","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/abandoned","id":"abandoned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/aftercare","id":"aftercare"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anaesthetic","id":"Anaesthetic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anaesthetist","id":"anaesthetist"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/birth","id":"birth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bmi","id":"BMI"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/c-section","id":"c-section"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/delivery%20ward","id":"delivery ward"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctors","id":"doctors"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/induction","id":"induction"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/informed%20consent","id":"informed consent"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kept%20informed","id":"kept informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/labour","id":"labour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/long%20labour","id":"long labour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/maternity","id":"maternity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/messed%20around","id":"messed around"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/notes","id":"notes"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/postnatal","id":"postnatal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ptsd","id":"ptsd"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/some%20staff","id":"some staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/spinal","id":"spinal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attitude","id":"staff attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staffing%20levels","id":"staffing levels"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stitches","id":"stitches"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgical%20team","id":"surgical team"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/traumatised","id":"traumatised"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wound","id":"wound"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wound%20care","id":"wound care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thankful","id":"Thankful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/inconsistent","id":"inconsistent"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/passed%20around","id":"passed around"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/maternity%20line","id":"maternity line"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/781840","id":"781840"}]},{"id":781057,"author":"Letdown once again","authorRoleId":1,"authorRole":"a carer","title":"Westmarc mobility centre","body":"This week my father had an appointment at westmarc.

I spoke with a nurse and then a doctor who asked me to attend Lister Street for medical review. He advised I had to be there for 23:45 as the centre closed at midnight. I said I would be there as close to that time as possible - this call ended at 23:28. I arrived at Lister Street from Galston at 23:47.  \r\nOn arrival I pressed the buzzer and was advised my appointment was quarter to and not ten to. I apologised and was granted entry. On entering a doctor was leaving and asked me if I had an appointment - I explained that I did. She continued to exit the building. On exiting both the doctor and a nearby porter began shouting over each other and to me that I needed to wear a face mask. I asked them to stop shouting as I was out of breath and uncomfortable. The doctor apologised - I put on a face mask noting that neither the doctor nor the porter were wearing one!  \r\nI then sat in the waiting room for 5 minutes and at this point it was around midnight. I was called by an ANP who proceeded to ask me exactly what NHS24 had said about the appointment. They then complained that this “is always happening to me” and how they would be speaking to a supervisor. Took basic obs and told me there would be nothing they would be doing and for me to see my GP in the morning.  \r\nNow I am a registered nurse of 10 years and I am shocked at the insensitive and unprofessional way I was treated tonight. I accept that perhaps I did not require treatment that couldn’t wait after being reviewed, however, I can not accept the poor and rude attitude of 3 members of staff I encountered tonight! I felt like an inconvenience from the moment I walked in the door.  \r\nThe doctor left before the end of the shift and I believe knowing that I was their patient. The porter was rude shouting “hey you” and pointing and shouting over the doctor at me in a frankly intimidating manner - marched in and out of patient area with no mask despite shouting at me to wear one. The nurse I spoke with I felt was also rude and unprofessional in discussing work place grievances in priority over assessment of me.  \r\nI was 2 minutes late for my appointment! I would never treat patients in this way. End of shift or not - we have a duty of care. I came home feeling no more reassured or having any advice regarding my symptoms or how I could ease them. I should have had a medical review.
