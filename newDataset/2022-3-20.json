I think the RBH Breast Clinic are brilliant, thank you.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2022-03-19T17:45:39","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-03-20T16:54:36","readBy":[{"name":"Royal Berkshire NHS Foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/925186","id":"925186"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/925186/responses","id":"925186"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/925186/healthservices","id":"925186"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/925186/tags","id":"925186"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rhw01","id":"RHW01","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxious","id":"anxious"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breast","id":"breast"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breast%20lump","id":"breast lump"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/brilliant","id":"brilliant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lump","id":"lump"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mammogram","id":"mammogram"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ultrasound","id":"ultrasound"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing","id":"amazing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/925762","id":"925762"}]},{"id":925188,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Medication request ","body":"I have requested medication, which for some reason is not on my repeat but I have often, and failed to get it.

He had been catheterised and this particular night fluid was not passing through to leg bag and pressure was building in his bladder. The nurse came into his room and realised they couldn’t offer him any help - as they explained they had an injury, but said they would go and get help and left the room. Meantime fluid was leaking from either side of catheter And the bed became wet as well as my husbands nightwear.  \r\nEventually someone else came in and my husband explained what was happening. This person (why I say person - my husband didn’t think this staff member was a nurse) but this person decided the answer was to fit a night bag to the leg bag. My husband assured him this would not work as problem appeared to be at catheter site and if it couldn’t drain into leg bag it definitely wouldn’t get to night bag. The staff member ignored my husband - who was becoming increasingly more distressed- and insisted this would work. My husband explained he was already lying wet and his whole situation would only get worse because this staff member was not tackling the problem and meanwhile the pressure was building and my husband was in pain. The member of staff said they would then have to get a doctor and my husband asked “now? The staff member said no in the morning. My husband explained he definitely couldn’t wait that long to which they replied well what am I supposed to do? and left my husband wet and in pain.  \r\nThese are the only two people on duty and it is fair to say one physically couldn’t help and the other hadn’t a clue and/or didn’t care less.  \r\nThere is a duty of care to patients which was most certainly lacking that night. The very worrying concern is potentially patients lives were put at risk that night.  \r\nOur Government should be absolutely ashamed they have not carried out their promises to NHS.

My waters broke again and I was admitted to the ward at Ninewells due to gestational diabetes and previous precipitate labour. With my first I had no pain relief because of the care and speed of my labour, apart from gas & air in the labour suite. I was adamant I wanted pain relief this time and surely I’d be able to get it as they had prior warning of my fast labour?  \r\nApparently not, as my baby decided he was coming at shift handover time. I laboured on the ward (again) in extreme agony (back to back) asking to go down to labour suite and was told I had to wait for shift handover. I got gas & air in the ward which did nothing for me. My labour was fast again, I was rushed to labour suite on a bed (again) told I was fully dilated and had no pain relief.  \r\nTwo poor experiences of birth at Ninewells. The first had a profound negative effect on my mental health which I’m still suffering with 6 years on.

During this time I underwent 4 x IVFs. I was in my early forties with reasonable AMH and no fertility issues other than age. I had a previous pregnancy a few years earlier with no issues. I was undergoing fertility treatment due to male factor infertility issues.  \r\nI feel that the treatment I received as a patient was not individualised at ACS at all. I was put on a treatment protocol for females with low AMH; prescribed the highest dose of fertility meds at a high cost physically/mentally/financially.  \r\nDuring IVF treatment I felt that I was not coping with the high dose of ovarian stimulation meds physically and mentally (Abdo pain / night sweats / headaches / mood swings) and often explained to the nurse that it seemed that it was too much ovulation stimulation and should be reduced. I was always told that because of my age I should be on max dose of fertility stimulation drugs and this would give me the best chance of success.  \r\nI feel that ACS pushed me to have maximum drugs to try and get an increased quantity of eggs harvested. I feel my concerns that I was on too much medication were not listened to and that I was just a number. I do not feel that the treatment was personalised in any way. I enquired about reducing the fertility meds and opting for a more natural cycle however I was advised that this would reduce any chance of pregnancy.  \r\nAfter 4 failed cycles at ACS and not being listened to I changed to another private clinic. The doctor at the new clinic agreed that I had been put on far too high a dose of ovarian stimulation meds and agreed that this would really not have been good for my body and would likely have impacted negatively on egg quality. At the new clinic I had another two cycles using less than half the amount of ovarian stimulation meds which yielded similar amounts of eggs. It was a breeze at the new clinic in comparison to the treatment at Glasgow ACS.  \r\nUnfortunately I did not get pregnant at the new clinic however I wish I had not wasted 2 years in my early forties doing IVF at ACS. I feel I was over -medicated with ovarian stimulation and the treatment protocol was not personalised. In my experience ACS do not personalise treatment and push maximum ovarian stimulation in an attempt to try and get as much eggs as possible. This is a trying process mentally and physically and one which requires scrutiny.  \r\nI also had a lot of issues with the administration side of things around consents and blood tests etc. There was always some issue. As well as that I found ACS very inflexible re appointment times.  \r\nI wanted to record my concerns publicly about ACS as it would be interesting to establish whether other females have had similar issues concerning being over-medicated with ovarian stimulation and this impacting on them negatively.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-03-17T21:32:10.0166667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2022-03-21T15:02:05.29","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":7},{"name":"Fertility Network Scotland","count":1},{"name":"Ulster University, MBBS (Medicine) 2021","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/924626","id":"924626"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/924626/responses","id":"924626"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/924626/healthservices","id":"924626"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/924626/tags","id":"924626"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/g107h-assisted-conception","id":"G107H-assisted-conception","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/angry","id":"angry"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20being%20listened%20to","id":"not being listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sad","id":"sad"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/administration","id":"administration"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appointment%20times","id":"Appointment times"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fertility","id":"Fertility"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/individual%20care","id":"individual care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ivf","id":"IVF"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ovulation","id":"ovulation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/regret","id":"regret"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ovarian%20stimulation","id":"ovarian stimulation"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/925602","id":"925602"}]},{"id":924999,"author":"Decde74","authorRoleId":8,"authorRole":"a staff member posting for a patient/service user","title":"The staff have all been lovely","body":"I came to Craigavon Hospital 8 days ago with a fractured foot.

She has osteoporosis and has just recovered from an acute episode of ill health which required hospital admission. She fell on her shoulder and had pain in her chest and arm. Her overriding anxiety was she had broken something. She arrived by ambulance in the evening. I phoned 3 hours after her arrival - dept very busy she was waiting to be seen. I phoned again in the early hours of the morning, Dr told me she was about to be assessed. Phoned an hour later - another Dr told me she was oxygen dependent, bloods had been taken, plan of action to be confirmed but she would be handed to the medical team and admitted. In the meantime My mum had phoned my brother saying she was being discharged. He picked her up from a reception area where she was sitting alone, no information provided other than a prescription for antibiotics. I realise the system is under pressure but to leave an exhausted elderly person unattended in an empty waiting room to make the call asking for a lift home at 4am after admission with a fall is not acceptable. She is self-caring, independent normally - but cannot remember as she is so tired what happened and what was said - and is in a lot of pain this morning. As family members we need information to continue care at home so as not to have to constantly refer to an overstretched system. What bloods were done? She was anaemic last week… cause still to be determined. Was she x rayed? Could she have a rib or vertebra fracture? This information is crucial to our ongoing care and re mobilization at home.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2022-03-18T08:15:57.4933333","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2022-03-21T16:48:28.743","readBy":[{"name":"Healthwatch North Yorkshire","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/924710","id":"924710"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/924710/responses","id":"924710"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/924710/healthservices","id":"924710"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/924710/tags","id":"924710"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rcd01_180","id":"RCD01_180","score":1},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confused","id":"confused"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anaemic","id":"anaemic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/antibiotics","id":"antibiotics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/chest%20pain","id":"chest pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/concerned","id":"concerned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/discharge%20at%20night","id":"discharge at night"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fall","id":"fall"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/information","id":"information"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/osteoporosis","id":"osteoporosis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/oxygen","id":"oxygen"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/shoulder","id":"shoulder"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/conflicting%20information","id":"conflicting information"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/misinformation","id":"misinformation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/family%20not%20kept%20informed","id":"family not kept informed"}]},{"id":924818,"author":"Chatham resident","authorRoleId":4,"authorRole":"a relative","title":"Queuing outside before visiting","body":"This is a follow up to my previous story about my wife being made to wait outside A&E at 4am in the morning whilst her mother with mixed dementia was taken in alone.  \r\nHer mother was later admitted to the hospital and the next day when my wife went to visit on a booked visiting slot, she and many others were made to queue outside in the rain and despite protesting and asking if they could go inside to get warm and get a cuppa in the cafe they were told in an abrupt and unfriendly manner by one of the women directing the queue that no they could not and they wouldn't be allowed in until they said so!
