I really couldn't ask for better care in the Acute Medical Unit. I have see care all over the world through travelling and the care here is truly second to none. The staff are just fantastic and it seems like it's not just a job to them but rather they really care for each patient they see. They are so busy but they devote time to individuals. The ward is very clean and I couldn't fault the cleanliness at all. I have been kept well informed every step of my hospital stay and if I ever don't understand something that one of the doctors has said, the nurses later on are more than willing to break it down into layman's terms for me which is so helpful. I am used to spending time on my own but being in a shared ward didn't bother me at all and I really enjoyed the social aspect of having someone else in this with me almost and being able to sympathize with each other. All in all the care in Craigavon cannot be faulted and I am so grateful to the team in the AMU for making my time in hospital much more pleasant. &nbsp;","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-07-12T17:48:02.4133333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-07-15T08:39:07.96","readBy":[{"name":"Southern Health and Social Care Trust","count":5}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/862078","id":"862078"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/862078/responses","id":"862078"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/862078/healthservices","id":"862078"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/862078/tags","id":"862078"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_32024_180","id":"ZT003_32024_180","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_32024_300","id":"ZT003_32024_300","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cleanliness","id":"cleanliness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/devotion","id":"devotion"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctor","id":"doctor"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/informed","id":"informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fantastic","id":"fantastic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happy","id":"happy"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/863886","id":"863886"}]},{"id":862102,"author":"Shawx79","authorRoleId":8,"authorRole":"a staff member posting for a patient/service user","title":"staff in emergency department at CAH are perfect, couldnt ask for better","body":"I came into ED with my son this morning.

I called on behalf of a patient and the person I spoke to seemed to be playing hardball for a simple request for a fit note, on behalf of somebody with multiple healthcare needs! First of all the online form doesn't work (why put a system on your website that doesn't work?), I was then asked if the patient has received a fit note for 'this illness' before and I said I'm sure they probably have, to which the staff member replied that that haven't, but then saying it was issued 2020. I was puzzled as to why I was asked if they knew already!?This behaviour seemed to display that they thought it was a fraudulent request.

I heard nothing back, and my address details were updated, so I thought nothing more of it.  \r\nSix months later, I returned to the practice to have some stitches removed (btw, I had continued to have regular consults with my GP throughout this time), and the receptionist recognised me and noted that my address was outside their area. They commented to me that I would have to find a new GP and I tried to explain that I had already filled in the paperwork to remain a patient. They ignored me and two weeks later, I received a letter from the practice saying I had one month to find a new GP closer to me and that I had been de-registered. I also then received the same letter from the NHS.  \r\nThe reasons for me remaining at the practice are very personal, but I have a number of ongoing health issues which require ongoing investigations and treatments and my GP was of the opinion that as long as I was ok to not receive house visits (never have them anyway!) then it shouldn't be a problem and they would request the partners consider that.  \r\nIt took me the better part of a month to get someone in the admin team to respond to me and it was only when I sent an email titled 'Complaint', that a manager actually spoke to me. They were very apologetic and said they would call me back the next day after speaking to the partners. They didn't call back. A week later, I chased it up and the next thing I got was an email saying that the partners had agreed to deregister me and that apparently it was a blanket policy. In my complaint, I requested a meeting between myself, my GP and a partner to discuss my situation and what would happen next. Not only did they ignore that, they just disregarded my health entirely.  \r\nThe long and the short of it is, I have less than three months to find a new GP before I have zero medical support. If it's a blanket policy, why bother asking people to fill in forms with the change of address? .  \r\nIt's infuriating when I finally find a GP I like and trust, and then the bureaucracy of the NHS kicks in and the needs and concerns of patient care go out the window.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-06-17T14:47:41.3766667","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2021-07-15T12:20:00.41","readBy":[{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2021)","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/855360","id":"855360"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/855360/responses","id":"855360"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/855360/healthservices","id":"855360"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/855360/tags","id":"855360"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/h85051","id":"H85051","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ignored","id":"ignored"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unimportant","id":"Unimportant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disregarded","id":"disregarded"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/conflicting%20information","id":"conflicting information"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/registering%20with%20a%20gp","id":"registering with a gp"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/service%20boundaries","id":"service boundaries"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/discharged%20from%20care","id":"discharged from care"}]},{"id":857633,"author":"Jiglig","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Poor experience but good locum","body":"My experience of this practice has been poor.

In my experience one of the doctors I found rude said it wasnt their problem and didnt have time to process even though I said I was dependant on the medication. I had to ring 111. Excuses for poor behaviour include lack of staff, staff illness (which I understand and is usually covered by locums) and of course Covid (but been having issues for a number of years). Usually no excuse, just rude and patronising.  \r\nOn a positive note the two interactions with locum doctors has been amazing and sorted problems/issues immediately without excuses or moaning or blaming others. One locum apologised for the practises behaviour (they didn't need to as wasn't their fault). They were apologising that I wasn't getting the appropriate care. Again, this locum went out of the way to make sure my medical concerns were addressed. See other recent reviews on the web for similar stories.  \r\nFrom my experience I would not recommend this surgery. It is bad enough having to deal with illness without dealing with this level of incompetence. I don't expect them to read or act on feedback given my previous interactions, I feel like it will be blame others and excuses.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-06-25T13:51:45.71","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2021-07-15T12:20:00.643","readBy":[],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/857633","id":"857633"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/857633/responses","id":"857633"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/857633/healthservices","id":"857633"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/857633/tags","id":"857633"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/y02658","id":"Y02658","score":1},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/locum","id":"locum"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/prescription%20delay","id":"prescription delay"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20training","id":"staff training"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unhappy","id":"unhappy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctor%20attitude","id":"doctor attitude"}]},{"id":859588,"author":"scorecardjb99","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Very poor management of failty in elderly patients in the commuity","body":"I feel that my elderly grandparent's care was very poorly managed by Randalstown Health Cente.

I gratefully accepted but didn't realise what an impact that would have on my supply. I wish they had explained that it might stop milk flow or had more knowledge about it as I wouldn't have given in despite being so tired.  \r\nOnce back home I was sore and healing and found breastfeeding very hard going. It was sore and neverending. As it turned out my baby regained his birth weight fine initially but it was the following weeks and months later that he deviated from the average weight. I was determined to solely breastfeed and was introduced to the breastfeeding team from fife. They provided me with a double expressing machine to use up to 5 times a day to encourage milk production and also came out to help.  \r\nAfter weeks of persisting however my milk production still seemed low and baby wasn't gaining enough weight, and with advice from my healthvisitor and breastfeeding team we decided to give a bit of formula. Within weeks he was gaining and obviously just needed some calories. He was much happier too and clearly not so hungry.  \r\nThe breastfeeding team were available on the phone all the time and helped me with a wee routine to stick to which would not interfere with my milk production. Over the next month the changes were amazing and he grew considerably. We are very grateful for the advice and help in those scary first few months.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-07-13T11:56:16.6066667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-07-15T13:45:52.037","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Tayside","count":13},{"name":"NHS Fife","count":4},{"name":"Fife Health & Social Care Partnership","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/862293","id":"862293"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/862293/responses","id":"862293"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/862293/healthservices","id":"862293"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/862293/tags","id":"862293"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sf9-breast-feeding","id":"sf9-breast-feeding","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sf9-health-visiting","id":"SF9-health-visiting","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/t101h_501","id":"T101H_501","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/t101h_501-apn","id":"T101H_501-APN","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/t101h_501-cmu","id":"T101H_501-CMU","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/advice","id":"advice"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/antibiotics","id":"antibiotics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/birth","id":"birth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood","id":"blood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20loss","id":"blood loss"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breastfeeding%20support","id":"Breastfeeding Support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/explanation","id":"explanation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/giving%20birth","id":"giving birth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happier","id":"happier"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/help","id":"help"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helped","id":"helped"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/information","id":"information"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/weight","id":"weight"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing","id":"amazing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/contactable","id":"contactable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fine","id":"fine"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tired","id":"tired"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20home","id":"at home"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/862903","id":"862903"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/863182","id":"863182"}]},{"id":862298,"author":"saturnhg33","authorRoleId":3,"authorRole":"a parent/guardian","title":"Mental health support and autism support","body":"I have a son with asbergers syndrome. He has been suffering with his mental health for the past two years. Over the last year and a half he has spent six months in hospital on three different occasions.  \r\nHe is now living in a flat because we were told by the social worker he would get more support in the community.  \r\nInitially when he moved into his flat he had support from framework and the enablement team (for two hours a week) and a mental health nurse. Very quickly (around three weeks) after he came out of hospital, the framework team and enablement team stopped working with him. He only has a deepo jab once a month., and I believe the mental health nurse has very little contact with him.  \r\nAt no point has the fact that he is on the autistic spectrum been addressed. He has pushed some support away. I know that he struggles socially and mixing with people. This should have been taken into account with providing support for him.  \r\nI recently heard about the transformation project in mental health. It is supposed to offer a wrap around person centred approach to treatment. To be honest my son's autism has never been addressed by any of the mental health teams he has worked with. This has really has impacted how affective the treatment is. He has pushed back on much of the treatment he has been offered. Because of this he is living in a flat virtually unsupported.  \r\nI was told by his first psychiatrist that mental health support for autistic people in Nottinghamshire is particularly bad.  \r\nI think it is only a matter of time before he is readmitted to hospital.  \r\nI am writing to you in total disgust for the support my son has been offered.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-07-13T12:29:03.5466667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-07-15T13:49:01.67","readBy":[{"name":"Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust","count":16},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2021)","count":1},{"name":"St. Andrews University ScotGEM Medical Students","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/862298","id":"862298"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/862298/responses","id":"862298"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/862298/healthservices","id":"862298"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/862298/tags","id":"862298"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rha-amh-county-ged","id":"rha-amh-county-ged","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rha-amh-county-ns","id":"rha-amh-county-ns","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/autism","id":"autism"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/autistic","id":"autistic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/continuity%20of%20care","id":"continuity of care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/follow%20up","id":"follow up"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/impacted","id":"impacted"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unsupported","id":"unsupported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pushed%20out","id":"pushed out"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/autism%20services","id":"autism services"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/862923","id":"862923"}]},{"id":862303,"author":"Kate08","authorRoleId":4,"authorRole":"a relative","title":"Unable to visit due to restrictions due to covid.","body":"My mum was in ward 3 north, we are a large family, and my father was unable to visit as well as my sisters and brothers due to restrictions due to covid.  \r\nI picked up the leaflet at reception and was able to get my Father and siblings connected very quickly.

The 2 main staff dealing with him at FVRH ward 31b are Frances and nearly qualified student nurse Julie, ready to qualify in a few weeks and heading on elsewhere ( big loss to FVRH)  \r\nThank you very much to all staff throughout the hospital for all your care and compassion.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-07-13T15:24:29.5533333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-07-15T13:54:49.177","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Forth Valley","count":8},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/862324","id":"862324"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/862324/responses","id":"862324"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/862324/healthservices","id":"862324"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/862324/tags","id":"862324"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/forth-valley-royal-palcare","id":"forth-valley-royal-palcare","score":5},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/forth-valley-royal-respiratory","id":"forth-valley-royal-respiratory","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/attention","id":"attention"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communications","id":"Communications"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/copd","id":"copd"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/end%20of%20life","id":"end of life"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happier","id":"happier"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/help","id":"help"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nursing%20care","id":"nursing care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassion","id":"compassion"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dignity","id":"Dignity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/considered","id":"considered"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/862915","id":"862915"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/862924","id":"862924"}]},{"id":862333,"author":"The unhappy","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"The only shelter we have from this heat","body":"Today it is 23 degrees in Wishaw and due to one person smoking in the court yard all 22 patients are being contained in the ward. &nbsp; Instead of punishing the non smokers it should be the smoker who is confined to the ward. &nbsp; Yes there are limited walk groups however the court yard is the only shelter we have from this heat.

They are hard working, knowledgable and friendly, they honestly cannot do enough for me and I admire their caring qualities. I also enjoy the good times I have with the nurses as they are always up for a laugh and a joke which brings a bit of life to the ward and makes my stay here more enjoyable.  \r\nEvery single member of medical staff I have interacted with have communicated everything to me very well and in language that I can understand. In particular a consultant called Mr Neill had an excellent manner of explaining my illness to me and the treatment plan for what's next, when talking to him I wasn't afraid to ask questions and knew all my questions were being answered in the best and most detailed way possible for me to understand. I got some bad news from another consultant who was called Mr Mark although the way this bad new was broke to me was exemplary and I felt it was in the most appropriate manner possible.  \r\nThis ward is very good and I have enjoyed interacting with other patients in my bay, I feel the bad news I received gave the other patients on the bay a chance to sympathise with me and express their feelings which made us all become closer and I have really enjoyed the bond created between the four of us. Additionally I would like to comment on the continuity of care which I have received on this ward as no matter how many staff change overs there is, all staff are kept up to date with my care and are able to take over when one nurse leaves etc this reassures me I am getting the best care I possibly can get.  \r\nOn the ward I feel like I get enough privacy when I need it, although as I have said before I do enjoy the social aspect of the ward. I really enjoy the freedom of being allowed out for a walk twice a day as it gets me off the ward and into some fresh air, this has been a very positive element of my stay. I think the menu is good as there is a good variety and I also get more than enough access to water.  \r\nOne thing I could suggest an improvement on would be to have the option of coffee/tea given in the afternoon as it's a long wait from lunch to dinner. Additionally I feel GP's need to be doing a lot more for patients. I myself presented with stomach pain on multiple occasions to the GP and nothing was done that needed to be, I had to present many times before I was referred on and perhaps if I was referred earlier for tests and scans I would have got a diagnosis much much sooner. I feel the work of the GP is not the same as the work of the hospital doctor.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-07-13T16:12:54.5066667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-07-15T14:12:09.683","readBy":[{"name":"Southern Health and Social Care Trust","count":2},{"name":"Ulster University, MBBS (Medicine) 2021","count":1},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2021)","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/862351","id":"862351"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/862351/responses","id":"862351"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/862351/healthservices","id":"862351"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/862351/tags","id":"862351"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_32024-4-north-surgical","id":"ZT003_32024-4-north-surgical","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/answering%20questions","id":"answering questions"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/caring","id":"caring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/consultant","id":"consultant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/continuity%20of%20care","id":"continuity of care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/food","id":"food"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/food%20choice","id":"food choice"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gp%20service","id":"GP service"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hard%20working","id":"hard working"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/humour","id":"humour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/knowledgeable","id":"knowledgeable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/other%20patients","id":"Other patients"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/privacy","id":"privacy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/socialising","id":"socialising"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happy","id":"happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/outdoor%20access","id":"outdoor access"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/explanations","id":"explanations"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tea%20and%20coffee","id":"tea and coffee"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/access%20to%20water","id":"access to water"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/delivering%20news","id":"delivering news"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/863894","id":"863894"}]},{"id":862354,"author":"Keeen88","authorRoleId":8,"authorRole":"a staff member posting for a patient/service user","title":"Everyone is so welcoming and helpful","body":"Overall I really don't have much negative to report.

Any questions I have asked the medical professionals have all been answered in the most detailed and informed way possible. I like how staff keep me up to date with my treatment and I know I am listened to.  \r\nThis ward is spotless and the cleaning staff go above and beyond to keep the ward in pristine condition. I like how the ward is a nice bright space with the blinds open so I can see out, I makes the area feel less claustrophobic. Fortunately I had an extremely fast movement from A& E up onto this ward and additionally I have had very short waits for scans and blood tests throughout my stay. I would really like to see the nurses get more rest as they are never off their feet.  \r\nFinally in terms of food I really enjoy my meals and find them extremely nutritional for someone like myself who is recovering. Water is always available to me. Huge appreciation to all staff and everything they did for me.

One thing I would say though is that I feel listened too and involved in decisions made by staff regarding my care. In terms of the ward I think I get enough privacy and enough space. I feel safe on the ward and am surprised at how clean it is. It is a credit to the cleaning staff here in the hospital.

A lot more money needs invested into the hospital sector to reduce these waiting times due to understaffing in the hospital.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-07-13T17:07:09.3433333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-07-15T14:34:36.1","readBy":[{"name":"Southern Health and Social Care Trust","count":3},{"name":"Ulster University, MBBS (Medicine) 2021","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/862362","id":"862362"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/862362/responses","id":"862362"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/862362/healthservices","id":"862362"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/862362/tags","id":"862362"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_32024-4-north-surgical","id":"ZT003_32024-4-north-surgical","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/a&e%20waiting","id":"a&E waiting"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/access%20to%20pain%20relief","id":"access to pain relief"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cleanliness","id":"cleanliness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good","id":"good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kept%20informed","id":"kept informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/privacy","id":"privacy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/space","id":"space"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staffing","id":"Staffing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting%20times","id":"waiting times"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/involved%20in%20decisions","id":"involved in decisions"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wait%20for%20bed","id":"wait for bed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/listened%20to","id":"listened to"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/863883","id":"863883"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/863908","id":"863908"}]},{"id":862364,"author":"Keeen88","authorRoleId":8,"authorRole":"a staff member posting for a patient/service user","title":"I would have liked more time with the doctors","body":"The staff in craigavon are absolutely brilliant and are run off their feet.

Any questions I have are answered in a reasonable time and it reassures me when staff go and get a second opinion as I know the answers they provide are informed and competent.  \r\nI also suffer with type 1 diabetes and on one occasion I feel the staff didn't listen to me regarding my condition. As a diabetic of over 40 years I know when I am going into a low and when I called to get help from the staff I feel I want listened to at all, when I knew I was right.  \r\nOverall I can't complain too much as the ward facilities are absolutely first class. I get more than enough privacy. One thing I would say from a diabetics point of view, I feel there needs to be a lot more variation in terms of slow release carbs as a lot of the items on the menu especially for breakfast aren't the most suitable.  \r\nI appreciate all the help I have got in this ward and am comfortable, safe and most importantly content with the care I am receiving.

All my questions are answered quickly and efficiently and it reassures me when staff know what they are talking about.  \r\nI would like a little more privacy on the ward as often at times it gets a bit much constantly seeing the other patients although by no means do I feel unsafe on the ward and given the nature of the NHS service I am content and grateful with the space I have been given.  \r\nI am amazed at the cleanliness of the area and it is a credit to the cleaning staff. It's hard to get a temperature that everyone on the bay is happy with but the staff are very accommodating and offer to open a window of I'm too warm or give me extra blankets if im too cold.  \r\nOne thing I would say is that at night the ward can be very bright depending on the sister in charge, additionally where my bed is situated I can see onto the corridors leading to other wards which means constant light in my eyes and this often makes it hard for me to sleep, I think if the hospital even reduced the lighting at night by half they would save an abundance of money.  \r\nOverall nothing I could suggest improvement on could get sorted at this level, things like better facilities and waiting times ect all need to be sorted out at a higher level than the staff here as they are only doing their job. The health sector needs more funding and that's the bottom line.","criticality":"minimally critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-07-13T18:50:31.32","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-07-15T15:20:41.647","readBy":[{"name":"Southern Health and Social Care Trust","count":3}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/862374","id":"862374"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/862374/responses","id":"862374"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/862374/healthservices","id":"862374"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/862374/tags","id":"862374"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_32024_320","id":"ZT003_32024_320","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/accommodating","id":"accommodating"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazed","id":"amazed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/answering%20questions","id":"answering questions"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cleanliness","id":"cleanliness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good","id":"good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helpfulness","id":"Helpfulness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/light%20at%20night","id":"light at night"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/privacy","id":"privacy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/safe","id":"safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/well%20looked%20after","id":"well looked after"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happy","id":"happy"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/865112","id":"865112"}]},{"id":862383,"author":"Keeen88","authorRoleId":8,"authorRole":"a staff member posting for a patient/service user","title":"It has really been a very positive experience","body":"I have been in 1 day so far and it has really been a very positive experience.

I have received exceptional care right from the very start of my pregnancy. Sheena and Natalie have been so caring and have gone above and beyond to support me every step of the way. I was very anxious this time around following 2 miscarriages after the birth of our son but they put my mind at ease from the first appointment.  \r\nAll of the staff have been extremely friendly and informative during our scan and antenatal appointments. From my experience Peterhead is a much more personal and calming experience than other hospitals I have attended previously. I had my heart set on a water birth with my son but due to my waters breaking before any contractions started and the risk of infection I was recommended to deliver in Aberdeen - which I absolutely can’t fault at all but was disappointed I didn’t get my planned water birth.  \r\nThis time around our baby girl kept us waiting for 13 days past her due date but I eventually got my water birth in Peterhead which was every bit as amazing as I’d hoped. Special thanks to Kelly for her outstanding care, who made us laugh and made my husband feel looked after too!  \r\nWe were made to feel so relaxed and nothing was too much bother after our daughter was born and although I’d breastfed my son it was reassuring to have the support and advice again from all the staff. I could not have asked for a better pregnancy and birth experience and I am extremely grateful to all of the staff at Peterhead CMU.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-07-13T22:51:21.42","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-07-15T15:45:45.637","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Grampian","count":5}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/862496","id":"862496"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/862496/responses","id":"862496"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/862496/healthservices","id":"862496"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/862496/tags","id":"862496"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/n333h_501","id":"N333H_501","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxious","id":"anxious"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disappointed","id":"disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/above%20and%20beyond","id":"above and beyond"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/antenatal","id":"antenatal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/birth","id":"birth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/contractions","id":"contractions"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/infection","id":"infection"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/positive","id":"positive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pregnancy","id":"pregnancy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scan","id":"scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/water%20birth","id":"water birth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing","id":"amazing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassuring","id":"reassuring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/relaxed","id":"relaxed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20disappointed","id":"very disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20ease","id":"at ease"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thanks","id":"thanks"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/865102","id":"865102"}]},{"id":861067,"author":"Dinah64","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Routine smear test","body":"I’d like to say thank you to Bridget (specialist nurse) at West Farm Surgery, Longbenton Newcastle!

Cannot fault the staff in terms of their care as all were lovely and acted with compassion at what was a difficult time. However, I feel it's important to highlight the issues we encountered around the lack of support for continuing our breast feeding journey.  \r\nThe ward is clearly not set up for supporting breastfeeding mother's, particularly those who are in the early days and just beginning to establish feeding. There was a lack of understanding from staff about how to source and then subsequently use the hospital grade pumps which were crucial when my son was requiring tube feeds to keep up my supply and to provide his nourishment. Thankfully I was aware of the infant feeding team based within ninewells due to my eldest son, however when one of the team initially tried to come to the ward to provide support, the charge nurse didn't allow them access. It was then a further 24 hours before they were allowed in to support me and source appropriate pumps etc by which time my nipples were damaged. For a hospital that has a gold standard award for breastfeeding, I feel that paediatric ward let's the hospital down.  \r\nThe paediatric ward also did not appear to have all of the resources required to effectively support babies who are pre term and advice had to be asked from the NICU team to source appropriately sized equipment to look after him. It is frustrating that babies who have been discharged from hospital after birth are then no longer able to access the NICU and are put straight to the paediatric ward when had the hospital picked up when he was born that he had congenital pneumonia, he would have ended up in the NICU and therefore been in the most appropriate place to meet his needs.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-07-13T20:07:44.2166667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-07-15T15:58:54.157","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Tayside","count":15},{"name":"Office of Joe Fitzpatrick, MSP for Dundee City West","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/862457","id":"862457"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/862457/responses","id":"862457"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/862457/healthservices","id":"862457"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/862457/tags","id":"862457"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/t101h_420","id":"T101H_420","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frustrating","id":"frustrating"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/birth","id":"birth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breast","id":"breast"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breast%20feeding","id":"breast feeding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breastfeeding%20support","id":"Breastfeeding Support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/congenital","id":"congenital"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/equipment","id":"equipment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/important","id":"important"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lovely","id":"lovely"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/paediatric","id":"paediatric"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pneumonia","id":"pneumonia"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/understanding","id":"understanding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassion","id":"compassion"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication%20between%20departments","id":"communication between departments"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/access%20to%20specialist%20services","id":"access to specialist services"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/863201","id":"863201"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/867035","id":"867035"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/867887","id":"867887"}]},{"id":862463,"author":"Daisy35","authorRoleId":3,"authorRole":"a parent/guardian","title":"Bad cut in leg","body":"Took my son down after he had an accident with his bike, he had a big deep cut so took him straight down to minor injuries, when I got there I was asked if I had phoned 111, I obviously hadn't as I panicked and from previous experience waiting on them calling back takes some time.

I was really thankful for them providing us with a little memory box which made out process so much easier and gave us opportunity to talk when we really thought we didn't have words left to say. I then opted to have an MVA procedure which in my head was going to be the most traumatic experience ever but thankfully the kindness of the nurses and consultant made this process really easy and I was very thankful for the thought that was given to my partner during this time who couldn't be with me due to covid.

Also I am sure there may have even been patients here that had not brought money to eat/drink not realising how long they would be waiting.\nWhen in the building we were not made aware of the 2-3hr wait changing to 5+hrs and staff were rude or unable to assure us. We were triaged at 1pm after a 2hr wait to get into the building and be registered. Then waited until nearly 7pm to be seen there were people with appointment times of 10am still waiting with no information provided.\nMy daughters assessment took 10minutes in total, so surely a 13yr old seen earlier, would not only free up a space but also not allow for a child to wait nearly 7hours to be seen (was made aware at the end of the appointment there were staffing issues).\nSo much more could've been done to make the system run smoother and more efficiently, I have the upmost respect for everyone working in the NHS currently, but experiences like today could be avoided if 3 simple things were put in place:\n1.
