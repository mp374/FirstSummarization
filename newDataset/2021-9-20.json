I was arranging an appointment for my mother who has serious health issues. Instead of a doctor phoning I received a phone call from a nurse and spent 10mins justifying why I needed to see a Doctor as I had arranged, Instead I got into a lengthy discussion as to why I needed to see a doctor. It is immensely hard just getting to see or even chat to a doctor over the phone with this surgery. Generally the advice given when speaking with anyone other than a GP is go to the chemist and get something over the counter, that's not the advice you expect from a GP unless it's a minor aliment. Unfortunately it's not that easy when you have mother with serious health issues. The service for \"appointments\" at present is poor. It's not just a matter of battling psychologically one's illnesses with this surgery, it's also a battle to get to see or communicate with GP to even discuss your illnesses. I'm not happy with how this practice is currently organising GP appointments, something needs to done differently.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2021-09-07T14:59:09","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2021-09-20T13:46:34","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/879187","id":"879187"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/879187/responses","id":"879187"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/879187/healthservices","id":"879187"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/879187/tags","id":"879187"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/m86017","id":"M86017","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happy","id":"happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20happy","id":"not happy"}]},{"id":876613,"author":"Neil19831","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Ending up in hospital while on holiday","body":"I am currently on holiday and ended up in hospital,  \r\nThe staff at the hospital were very kind and caring and looked after me very well so they made me feel happy while in hospital","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-09-09T18:38:11.3966667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-09-20T14:37:25.69","readBy":[{"name":"United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust","count":6}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/876613","id":"876613"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/876613/responses","id":"876613"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/876613/healthservices","id":"876613"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/876613/tags","id":"876613"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rwdla_180","id":"RWDLA_180","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/caring","id":"caring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ct%20scan","id":"CT scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kind","id":"kind"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happy","id":"happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/epiploic%20appendagitis","id":"epiploic appendagitis"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/879481","id":"879481"}]},{"id":877351,"author":"petemurry","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"kidney disease","body":"Back in June/July of 2019 I was admitted to ward 22 and in the end was diagnosed with MPGN a kidney disease which I am still dealing with.

I was first admitted in April 2020 with breathing difficulties caused by Covid that I had contracted through my work. After their brilliant work and expertise I was able to return home. However by December I was again unwell and ended up being admitted on one of their busiest nights. I was told at one point there were 14 ambulances waiting with patients at A & E. Although I was unaware of the pressure the hospital must have been under as I was treated like I was the most important person there by everyone I met! I spent nearly a week as an inpatient at a time right before Christmas when we were suddenly plunged into level 4 lockdown. Again everyone I came into contact with was cheerful and doing their best to give everyone the best treatment they could. I finally came home a few days before Christmas. While in hospital I had an ultra sound and a CT scan both departments couldn't do enough to help. When I came home I needed to go back for an mri scan and wasn't expecting to hear anything with Covid, the holiday and New year. Again I was amazed when my appointment arrived without delay and again the department staff were wonderful. Following this scan the surgeon called me within days with the result and news that I would require surgery, he was so apologetic when explaining that due to Covid the wait would be until the end of the year. Then in May I suddenly got a call to tell me my operation was scheduled for a couple of weeks time! I then attended the various pre op clinics and again staff were friendly and couldn't do enough to help. Finally I had my operation at the Sunderland day unit and thanks to the skill of my surgeon and the staff in the unit I returned home the same day and have made a great recovery. I wanted to take this opportunity to say that my experience of this hospital has been outstanding and words cannot express how grateful I am to everyone who made it possible for me to see this birthday.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2021-09-19T22:16:26","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-09-20T15:34:57","readBy":[{"name":"Medway NHS Foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/879205","id":"879205"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/879205/responses","id":"879205"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/879205/healthservices","id":"879205"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/879205/tags","id":"879205"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rpa02","id":"RPA02","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazed","id":"amazed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breathing","id":"breathing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breathing%20difficulties","id":"breathing difficulties"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/brilliant","id":"brilliant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ct","id":"ct"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ct%20scan","id":"CT scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/great","id":"great"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/important","id":"important"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mri","id":"mri"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mri%20scan","id":"MRI scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/operation","id":"operation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scan","id":"scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cheerful","id":"cheerful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wonderful","id":"wonderful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thanks","id":"thanks"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid","id":"covid"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid%2019","id":"covid 19"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20home","id":"at home"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/under%20pressure","id":"under pressure"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/879761","id":"879761"}]},{"id":878824,"author":"raincd35","authorRoleId":8,"authorRole":"a staff member posting for a patient/service user","title":"Midwives are kind, caring & personable","body":"My maternity stay has been nothing but excellent.

The doctors/nurses themselves are fine, but the way it is managed it ridiculous. Pre covid it was hard to book an appointment, the phone was never answered, now it is next to impossible.\n\nNow you have to call first thing, and hope that it is not engaged meaning around 80+ calls to get through, which when your working is hard to manage. If you call after lunch there's no way to book an appointment they tell you you have to call in the morning!? Why can't I just book one now, even for a few days/weeks time?!\n\nToday I have been told I have to use their new online system which is a lot worse than the old patient access one they had (which for some reason they binned off a while ago). After booking, I got a text saying \"You will receive a text or phone call within 2 working days\"....2 days!?!!? There's no time given when this response will be, or what the response will be, is that an appointment to speak to the doctor? I have no idea. Whilst a lot of the time I can answer my phone whilst working, that is not always the case, I have meetings, I have to be out on site, why can't they give me a time so I can ensure I am free, rather than me having to hope I am available to answer.\n\nI appreciate I may have to wait for an appointment, but I should be able to book one at a suitable time even if it is days in the future. Past surgeries I have always been able to book an appointment either via phone or online instantly and I would then at least know I what time and when I will be seen/spoken to.\n\nDon't be fooled, this practice was terrible before Covid, it is just even worse now and I suspect they will continue to use Covid as an excuse for the foreseeable future.

Every time myself or my partner call to make an appointment we are on hold for sometimes up to an hour to then be told there are no appointments left. On the rare occasion there are appointments left the receptionist decides our issue is not an emergency and therefore we can not make an appointment. My partner suffers with very bad eczema which he needs steroid treatments for which can not be gotten at the pharmacy. He has to have a prescription from a doctor. If he doesn't have this, it can get very bad and spread across his entire body. When it's this bad, he is unable to work as he can barely move from the pain. How can a receptionist deem this as a non emergency? On another occasion I had a ear infection and was in agony for a number of days before trying to get an appointment. I had gone to the pharmacy first, but they advised they are unable to give over the counter products for this and that I would need to see a doctor. When contacting the GP they tell me they won't see me for an ear infection and that I need to go to the pharmacy, even though I  had already done this. In the end I had to call 111 who advised me to go to A&E. The doctor in A&E was appalled that the receptionist wouldn't give me an appointment as I needed medication which could not be gotten without a prescription.  There are many more instances but are more private and I would not be comfortable disclosing on a public forum. I think the Receptionists require more training as they have very poor customer service skills and deem everything as a non emergency.

Which is poor. An hour later obviously there are no appointments left. I have three cysts now all from a medication that my GP told me just call back and we will swap it back straight away and not to worry... These cysts are painful for reception to explain the next available appointment is 17th October or I can keep calling every day... just to be cut off everyday. I explained that this is poor as it just cuts off and was told that I can go find another GP practice if I don't like this one. Which is very hard as the good ones have waiting lists.

Would not recommend.\n","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2021-09-20T09:05:07","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-09-20T15:52:35","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/879215","id":"879215"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/879215/responses","id":"879215"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/879215/healthservices","id":"879215"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/879215/tags","id":"879215"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/e82090","id":"E82090","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/face","id":"face"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good","id":"good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20good","id":"not good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/worse%20than%20before","id":"worse than before"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/879805","id":"879805"}]},{"id":879243,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Great Practice","body":"On Friday 10th September I rang the surgery as I wanted some advice regarding back pain I had been suffering with for a few days.

","body":"I have ticked the \"dont know\" depatmental box because there doesn't seem to be an A&E box. I was advised to go to A&E by a doctor on 111. Generally excellent service but I was taken by a nurse into a ward with covid positive patients [Majors]. I have Long Covid. This is NOT the same as Covid. I don't have covid. I was there for about 5 minutes when the senior nurse got me out of there with haste. She then berated the supervisor of the nurse who as far as I could see didn't seem that fussed. This was Friday 10th September \nI woke on Monday 13th with a sore throat and a cough. Not sure what that might be but have ordered a CPR test.\n\nOn Sunday 12th I returned for a CT scan and was told by telephone call to report [as soon as possible] to Team 1 [opposite the pharmacy]. We did this, arriving about 11am and explained that we were there for a CT scan with contrast and the receptionist said we were in the wrong place, we confirmed that we had been told to report to Team 1 but she sent us to radiology. The receptionist in radiology asked if a canula had been fitted we said no so she said go back to Team 1. We did this and the team 1 receptionist said that we had to be triaged at A&E so that they could confirm that a canula was required. We went back to radiology and the receptionist then personally took us back to team 1 and explained that the nurses in room 16 normally inserted canulas. the Team 1 receptionist said that they were busy but the Radiology receptionist took us to room 16 anyway where there were 2 nurses with no patients and these 2 very efficiently inserted the canula and we were back at Radiology in a few minutes. The \"jobsworth\" attitude of the Team 1 receptionist was adding triage workload to the A&E department and delaying treatment. The hospital has enough work with out more being added on by administrative incompetence.\n\n\nWhile waiting to be triaged I watched a cleaner remove a single use plastic waste bag from a litter bin. He secured the bag with a single use plastic tie and then replaced the bag with 2 single use bags. The use of plastic in this way is not sustainable.\n\nWe went to treatment room 1 in majors and the tap was not turned off correctly because the positioning of the arms meant it fouled the duct panel at the rear. My daughter, who was with me said that she had been in the same room 2+ years ago and the problem was apparent then. Assuming it started at that point my calculation is that this represents the water from half an Olympic sized swimming pool which has been wasted. The financial cost will be about £2,000 but it is an unsustainable environmental cost. How many other similar taps are there in the hospital?\n\nGood feedback would be somebody coming back to me to say that the tap has been fixed, all other taps have been checked and plastic use is being reduced. .

At first the service was acceptable, sometimes very good, and there have been occasional instances of individuals being extra helpful and kind.  However, in recent years there has been a clear and obvious decline in the standard of service offered, starting well before the current covid crisis.  I see from other reviews that this is not a unique observation, and also that the response to criticism from the practice manager is defensive, patronising and authoritarian.  \n\nToday I tried to book an appointment for a doctor to help my mother, who has multiple health issues, including dementia, heart disease, profound deafness, and mobility problems, and it was impossible because all triage appointments for the day had been filled.  The only alternatives offered were to try a local pharmacy, a drop-in centre, use Livi, or consult online web pages.   I am curious to know which of these options would suit my very frail, very confused, wheelchair using mother.  I do not live in the area, which means I cannot offer personal help, and her carer does not drive or use anything other than basic technology.  The final alternative is to try again tomorrow.  So, like peasants clamouring at a gate for charity I am expected to join the scramble every day to access a service for which my mother has paid during a long working life.  You have previously said that one of the reasons for making changes to the way we access services is so that reception staff will be able to deal more quickly with those people who have difficulties using the online systems.  If this was the goal, it has been an abject failure.  I cannot message you, I cannot book an appointment, and nobody ever seems to answer the phone. My own surgery has provided exemplary levels of care with scarcely any deterioration of speed or accessibility throughout the pandemic.  \n\nShepperton practice manager is often at pains to tell us that general practice is changing and is clearly frustrated that we are apparently unable to accept that change.  It would be more useful if the practice would accept firstly that few people resent change for the better, and ask why so many people would take the trouble to tell you repeatedly that your systems are not working, and fall below the standard available elsewhere.  At present your surgery is in effect closed, apart from a tiny window each day when we fight to get your attention.  Your website is cluttered, unfriendly, dictatorial and not intuitive to use. It seems to be constructed specifically to prevent access to services for most people. Even your telephone answering system sounds stern and unfriendly.\n\nLike most people, I am a fierce advocate of the NHS and most of the people who work within it, but this general practice is increasingly failing to offer the level of compassion,  support and effectiveness  we have a right to expect.
