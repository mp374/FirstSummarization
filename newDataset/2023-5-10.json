He was in severe pain with his head, and had signs of a possible bleed. He was triaged fairly quickly but that's about as good as it gets. The rest of the 17 Hours he spent in there consisted of being lied to by almost every member of the team to our faces, purely because they didn't know, or didn't want to deal with the questions so would just lie and say they will check or get something, then just didn't! We waited well over the allotted 5 hours to be seen by a doctor, only to be seen by another nurse who could not tell if it was serious enough so had to get the opinion of a doctor, which is what we were already waiting for. Waited another hour to be seen by the doctor, each time having to explain what the problem was, go through the same tests only to have her tell us that she didn't think it was serious but we should probably do a head scan even though he didn't actually qualify for one. He had a visible dent in his head! They told us this would be another hour, but after waiting another 3 we decided to leave. We were told we could not leave as he could die....if it was that serious why not treat him quicker. We were constantly told they would check up on the times, check with this doctor or that doctor etc etc and no one ever did what they said, we would watch them walk past the doctor to get a coffee and sit and chat at the computer desk not actually doing what they said. I complained after waiting over 1hr for the next set of pain relief in front of the whole ward, and this seemed to be the only way they would listen to me, which is not really on as we had been polite and patient up till around 12hrs of nothing being done. My husband was told 1hr for the scan, he actually waited another 7 Hours, then another hour after that to be told he had a fracture and to go home. They pumped him so full of morphine whenever he dared to ask a question, that it was obvious that they just didn't want to know, even after him explaining that the pain was not subsiding. All but one of the nurses were rude and arrogant, not answering a simple question even when speaking to their faces. They would come in and do his obs, and when questions as to why his heart rate was so low, did not even reply just shrugged it off, not even an explanation or ill get someone, just non responsive, it was so bad! The receptionist was awful, did not even look at you just barked questions. I get that there are people who abuse the A&E department but that does not mean that you have to treat everyone who comes in as a burden, my husband has left vowing never to go back to Derriford again. He was also not given any advice on what to do about his head apart from rest. Lets hope there isn't anything more serious going on as clearly Derriford A&E could not care less!

The call back system (if you can get on the list in the first place) doesn’t really work for those of us that work full time and can’t guarantee we will be available when the GP call comes through. On-line access is extremely limited and prone to closing without notice.\nI fully understand the issues around the increasing local population and GP shortages, but it is such a shame that this is impacting on what used to be the best practice I have ever been registered at.\nI notice only one GP appears to be full-time- perhaps reviewing the ratio of full-time to part-time staff might be something that would help improve the situation.

After the triage within the first 30 minutes, I waited 2.5 hours in the minor injuries unit, despite the presence of a white board in the waiting area there was no information displayed regarding wait time provided in the marked sections. I was then called into an anteroom where I was surprised that my appointment was with a nurse practitioner, not a doctor. I can see the benefit of this for minor injuries, however I was not greeted with  any empathy or kindness and felt from the onset some hostility when I said' I thought I was being seen by a doctor'. The nurse made notes and examined my eye. I was advised that the eye clinic 'do not normally allow appointments with patients presenting with an eye cyst' and that the fact that it was effecting my work 'would not be considered'. I managed to press for a referral to the eye clinic and explained that if my eye was recovered, I would then be able to cancel the appointment. This has been an upsetting experience. This trust is graded as 'Requires Improvement', I am very surprised that the 'caring' category is graded by the CQC as good. I did not find that this was an experience that I could remotely remark as caring. Normally I would not waste my time writing reviews. This experience has prompted me to do so as the hospital needs to start thinking more about every patients experience.

The subsequent X ray showed no damage to the knee and I was sent home with an appointment for the fracture clinic which I duly attended. Neither of these clinics bothered to X ray my hip despite being made aware of a prosthetic joint and it emerged later that there was in fact a serious ring fracture around the prosthetic hip joint. I was subsequently admitted for urgent remedial surgery. I now have extensive metal bracing and scarring and am looking at a lengthy recovery period. I can't help but speculate about a very different outcome if the damage had been spotted on the first or the second visit.

He telephoned me and said \"I have hope results, please don't hang up until I find you, I can't afford to lose you again\" instantly I'm worried. He takes me into a small room with just 2 chairs. He does not tell me my test results but proceeds to question me about my symptoms. When I told him he was making me feel rather worried, he pulled a face and said \"am I? And why is that? This is how things work\" his attitude was not very nice and I think purposely trying to make me feel that I was in the wrong. It was horrible. I just think if someone comes in for tests on their heart and the results are OK, lead with that. I don't think I've ever been so frightened in a conversation in my life.

I am just left like this contemplating ending my life.","criticality":"strongly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-04-14T00:46:56.1433333","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2023-05-10T09:23:44.593","readBy":[],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1053655","id":"1053655"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1053655/responses","id":"1053655"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1053655/healthservices","id":"1053655"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1053655/tags","id":"1053655"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rgd","id":"RGD","score":1},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/autism","id":"autism"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/camera","id":"camera"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/death","id":"death"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disabled","id":"disabled"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/infertile","id":"infertile"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"}]},{"id":1063202,"author":"Very-nervous-lady","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"My broken leg","body":"I went over on my ankle, dislocated it, fractured it and broke my fibula. Went to Forth Valley Hospital where I was informed I would need surgery. Prior to surgery they wanted to manipulate my ankle back into place... Well, I was terrified. Petrified that it was going to be excruciating.  \r\nGot down to the plaster room where I was met by NA's Nicole and Claire. They immediately made me feel at ease, they had the best sense of humour, made me laugh, took my mind of it all and took everything at my pace. They put up with my ugly crying. The doctor called Damien was also fantastic and done his best to straighten my leg. He got my toes pointing in the right direction which was brilliant. All three really did go out their way to show me empathy and helped me through it.  \r\nFast forward 2 weeks and I attended outpatients to change my plaster and get my stitches taken out after my surgery and I was seen by Nicole and Claire again. This immediately put me at ease as let's face it I am a wimp when it comes to it and I had gotten myself worked up again. But knowing that I was in their capable hands, I knew I didn't have to worry. I can't honestly describe how brilliant they are at their jobs. Julie the qualified staff member came to see me in the plaster room as well and was so lovely, again put me at ease and explained everything that was going on with my leg.

I had accidentally discovered that this unit exists only a month earlier and had no preconceived ideas about its capabilities.  \r\nThe Hospital is well signposted and easy to find and even has a free part to the car park most welcome. Having found the Cardiac Assessment Unit and reported to reception, I was asked to take a seat and was fully expecting the usual 2- 4 hour wait however a friendly face appeared after 2 minutes, called my name and led me to a private room where I was interviewed and hooked up to various pieces of equipment for ECG, blood pressure measurements and more.  \r\nPrior to entering the room, I noticed a red framed award on the wall which had been earned by the local staff for excellent conduct - can’t be bad.  \r\nUnfortunately, the ECG results told another story and showed Atrial Fibrillation which meant that I was to be confined to barracks until the condition normalised with the aid of medication.  \r\nI had no phone chargers, changes of clothing, wash kit, toothpaste etc however the staff found me everything they could to make me comfortable.  \r\nTea and toast kept arriving and (without ringing any bells or even asking).  \r\nI was also given various reading material to help me understand the workings of the heart and solid commercial advice on what medical gadgets to buy. For example I can now obtain my ECG and heart rate readings in moments with an inexpensive unit which blue tooth's to my phone and gives a real time waveform which is then interpreted for you. That unit is FDA approved. There are various wearable smartwatches which do similar things and gather a history of your condition - could be useful.  \r\nI was genuinely impressed with the treatment I was given, both professionally and through kindness empathy and care, enough to ask if there was a feedback process for me to share my experiences with others and hence this post.  \r\nThank you Omagh Cardiac Assessment Unit.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-05-06T19:57:45.0533333","progress":"Story has a

I have type 2 diabetes and there is hardly any check-up for me and there is hardly an occasion when I was given medicine on time. As a gown man, I can live with these dysfunctionalities. But for almost a month we have been calling the surgery for my daughter who has a cough with rattling sounds and constantly getting fever. Our calls so far could not get any further than reception, and we get the same message \"No appointment calls us back\". Today we requested a senior person with the responsibility to answer our queries. As this is an ongoing issue and we are concerned that giving her painkillers on a long-term basis could affect her kidney/liver. We also highlight that this could be a sign of leukaemia, however, the surgery has not responded to our appeals. We are seriously concerned because it concerns the health of a 4-year-old. NHS should investigate and take appropriate action to stop such behaviour.

Use the urgent care centre so wait there 4 hours to be told that the gp surgery is the only route to access the services I need in a timely manner. Econsult is again switched off until 12.01 am. Stay up till this time and at 12.05 get a message saying the practice are no longer accepting requests.
