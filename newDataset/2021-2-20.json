During that time the meet and greet people kept checking that we were all feeling well and even told a couple of jokes creating a great atmosphere and the time just flew.   A couple of days later I had an issue requiring some medication and was referred to the Practice by the Chemists in Royton.  I spoke to the receptionist and explained the situation she was so kind showing sympathy and dealing with the situation immediately.  After supplying a required sample she told me I would receive a call shortly.  I drove straight home and as I walked through the front door the phone rang.  I spoke to the Practice Nurse and following that conversation I was able to collect the prescribed medication within 2.5 hours of visiting the surgery.  What a fantastic service from all the staff. I have occasion to visit the District Nurses at the Practice on a weekly basis with my Him Indoors.

Not only are we all concerned about contracting Covid but also having to cope with a seemingly endless lockdown. Being in the fifth cohort my wife and I were very pleased that we would be vaccinated. I received my invitation on Thursday by text, and we both assumed my wife, being just five months younger and approaching her 67th birthday, expected a similar invitation a day or two later. My appointment was made swiftly and efficiently (as was the vaccination process) BUT when my wife received a letter from the NHS - it was not to the surgery but a range of options from Attleborough to Brighton! Not even Norwich! My wife felt very much the second class patient. She raised the issue with surgery. No empathy - just a brush-off. As she was becoming clearly distressed at the thought of having a delay - I went along to the vaccination surgery the day before my appointment and offered my jab to her. The receptionist at Cringleford would not countenance the idea and explained my shot was individually registered to me. Sorry - rot. I was not bothered about having a delay and really could not understand why the substitution could not be done. This was re-enforced  when I had my vaccination.\nI acknowledge  that things are not easy, but I would have thought my wife is not alone about being anxious about things and it was such an easy thing to do. I was not seeking a jab myself. The problem was solved by having to book a vaccination at Ipswich - thankfully not Brighton!\nWith every day we hear in the media about mental well-being, I find it difficult to understand why the receptionist and, indeed, other members of the Humbleyard team did not recognise this as “a cry for help”. We have lived in Swardeston just 18 months and our only visit to the Surgery was to register. We are fortunate that we have not had to seek medical assistance but this lack of care has left us both disillusioned and disappointed.\n","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2021-02-19T19:21:10","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-02-20T07:44:39","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/825825","id":"825825"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/825825/responses","id":"825825"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/825825/healthservices","id":"825825"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/825825/tags","id":"825825"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/d82064","id":"D82064","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxious","id":"anxious"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disappointed","id":"disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lack%20of%20care","id":"Lack of care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/alone","id":"alone"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/concerned","id":"concerned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/day%20surgery","id":"day surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disillusioned","id":"disillusioned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/distressed","id":"distressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fortunate","id":"fortunate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vaccination","id":"vaccination"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20concerned","id":"very concerned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20pleased","id":"very pleased"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pleased","id":"pleased"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20disappointed","id":"very disappointed"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/826500","id":"826500"}]},{"id":825849,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Poor service","body":"Extremely difficult to get through to speak to someone.

Trying to book an appointment with rude receptionists is a definite common occurrence. Waiting in the reception area for over 40 minutes is to be expected. Even before the current health pandemic this surgery had many issues. If your relying on a telephone appointment be aware you’ll be waiting all day and possibly not be contacted if at all and have to run the gauntlet of trying to explain how important your test results or symptoms are and then have to explain and justify yourself and your distress to staff receptionists who’s mission it seems is to end the call quicker than a supermarket worker scanning shopping at a local budget supermarket. Excuses such as we’ve had a medical emergency and we’re running behind or the doctor will call you at some point are common and happen more frequently then is acceptable. How a qualified doctor can misdiagnose a serious health condition and fail to read hospital results properly and also not know the procedure for hospital referrals is mystifying. If you value your health and family members health then avoid this surgery. Hopefully divine intervention a decent independent health review of the practice and it’s common practices lack of care irresponsible outcomes will be forthcoming. I know I’m not the first and certainly won’t be the last who has had more than one bad experience at this practice and I hope this honest review will allow others to make an informed choice and better manage their health issues and concerns. The nicest thing about this surgery is the distance of the chairs in the waiting area and the fresh air on the way out of the doors. Also if you have medications don’t use the surgery pharmacist as the lady there seems to enjoy making you wait longer than average and will serve others who arrived after you handed your prescription in and seems to enjoy belittling you if you even try to question mention that you’re being overlooked. However since the local supermarket in the area has better mannered pharmacists my advice would be to use their services regarding medications. I wish I could pretend and detail a more positive feedback on my experiences at this practice but my honesty and the guilt wouldn’t allow me. I hope things improve at this surgery but only an enforceable type action by registered government health organisations would be the most effective in redeeming and restoring the reputation and services that this medical practice needs. Improvements are welcome and overdue alongside retraining.

We have always had good care.\nI have chronic health problems and my husband has recently developed serious health issues.\n\nWe have both been well looked after.  Despite the pandemic, all the staff have continued to attend to our needs.  We have both been seen in the surgery a number of times in the past year and every time have been impressed with the COVID measures in place. It has always felt SAFE.\n\nWe have had phone consultations and have sent in photos when requested, usually followed up with a face to face meeting with our great GP.  We never feel rushed, although we know they must be really busy.  We have met all of the GPs over the years and every one of them has been excellent.\n\nThe nurses have also been extremely helpful and supportive and the person who takes blood (she will know who she is) is so good at it that I hardly feel a scratch. (I have had blood taken many times at the hospital and know that this is a real skill as my vein doesn't always co-operate!).\n\nThe reception and admin staff have been very helpful in answering queries about prescriptions, sorting out appointments and doing their utmost to make sure that things are ok for us. \n\nI am sure everyone at the VMC is under tremendous pressure but they don't let it show.\n\nThe only downside is the building itself as this is no longer suitable but with the new clinic building well under way this will soon be resolved.  At the moment, some of the GPs have surgeries upstairs (no lift) but they are always willing to use a room downstairs to see you if you let them know when making the appointment. \n\nThe VMC is entering a new era, merging with other local practices and subsequently moving to a brand new building. There will no doubt be some disruption and some teething troubles at first but I have no doubt that everyone's first consideration will be to keep everything running as smoothly as possible for their patients.\n\nMy husband and I thank them all for everything they do for us.\n\n","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2021-02-20T10:52:17","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-02-20T15:14:09","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/825877","id":"825877"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/825877/responses","id":"825877"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/825877/healthservices","id":"825877"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/825877/tags","id":"825877"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/g81032","id":"G81032","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood","id":"blood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/face","id":"face"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/good","id":"good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20good","id":"not good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/rushed","id":"rushed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/safe","id":"safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/well%20looked%20after","id":"well looked after"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/impressed","id":"impressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/826501","id":"826501"}]},{"id":825876,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Coronavirus vaccine","body":"Had my vaccine yesterday at this surgery.
