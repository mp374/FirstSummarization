They fixed me up and answered all my concerns, the also pointed out my stitches would need removing where I’d been told they would dissolve!!!\nIt’s not only the care whilst having a procedure it’s the aftercare given as well. \nExtremely disappointed at the aftercare or none that I have received apart from the lovely ladies in the treatment room. \n","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2023-02-24T22:25:19","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-02-25T13:30:47","readBy":[{"name":"BMI Healthcare Ltd","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1034735","id":"1034735"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1034735/responses","id":"1034735"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1034735/healthservices","id":"1034735"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1034735/tags","id":"1034735"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/nt403","id":"NT403","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disappointed","id":"disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/aftercare","id":"aftercare"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood","id":"blood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/carpal","id":"carpal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/carpal%20tunnel","id":"carpal tunnel"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/carpal%20tunnel%20release","id":"carpal tunnel release"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dressing","id":"dressing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stitches","id":"stitches"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20disappointed","id":"very disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doing%20well","id":"doing well"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1037507","id":"1037507"}]},{"id":1034736,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Practice managed terribly","body":"This used to be a great practice but they seem to have a high admin turnover and each member of staff seems to be more unhelpful than the last. My last telephone calls with them were rude, unprofessional and incredibly unhelpful. They also still do not see patients with Covid no matter the situation or how vulnerable the patient is whereas many other practices just put measures in place to allow them to do this. \n\nThe practice is not run well and they do not book face to face visits, you instead need to go through a telephone visit first. If it’s something that needs to be seen or listened to such as a rash, a lump or suspected breathing complications (which you’ve already explained to the receptionist) they will still book a telephone appointment first. If this is to save time it only wastes everyone’s time. The receptionist always asks why you need to see the Dr but there doesn’t seem to be any triaging here like there is at other practices or like they used to do prior to Covid. Rather than offering a face to face for something urgent and important but not yet an emergency they will advise you to go to an urgent care centre or A&E to have a face to face appointment instead although it is not an emergency and that is not what those services are for. \n\nA couple of the Drs here are fantastic but they also have many Drs and nurses who come and go (possibly locums) who are terrible and have given me personally conflicting and scarily incorrect information and advice. \n\nIf you aren’t happy with the service you can complain to the Practice Manager, however whenever I am physically in the Drs surgery the receptionist is always on the phone telling someone they can complain to the Practice Manager or that the Practice Manager will call them back. However, looking at the reviews here the surgery is stating that they take the care of their patients seriously and ask reviewers to contact the Practice Manager to discuss the issue. This standard template response further impounds that the surgery do not care about their patients. I am sure this review will get the same or similar response. \n\nThere seem to be a lot of reviews on here about the telephone system, this has been a problem going back years. The surgery are aware of the issues but do not rectify it which is so frustrating when you have to keep calling the surgery 100 times at 8am if you want any hope of an appointment. You also cannot book future appointments, they only offer same day and either morning or afternoon so you wait by the phone all day. If you miss the call you’ve missed your chance, they will not call back and you cannot reach the dr through reception. \n\nSince Covid, the surgery has become abysmal and the level of care has dropped to substandard levels. The admin staff are awful and common sense working and patient care no longer seem to prevail here. It’s very sad. We are tired of all the issues and like many others are looking to move our family to another Drs surgery.

Could hardly walk or talk. Eventually, my daughter called 999 as pain was deteriorating and becoming unbearable. If I could have driven, then I would. Ambulance arrived and I felt very judged - 'you're only round the corner from the hospital' being one, jovial, comment. Walking to vehicle, doubled over, no help at all to steady myself - despite three paramedics present. Felt all boxes were ticked, but no compassion. Did not feel good and I have never felt so ill, or frightened, in my life. I support the NHS, but feel maybe some workers have compassion fatigue? I am in my 50s. If I had been elderly would it have been different? If the pain had been explicit ie bleeding limbs, would that have been different? At a time when you feel very vulnerable and in (unknown) excruciating agony, it felt uncomfortable to be treated like a wearying tick box. Very odd. I rarely use services, do not take them for granted, and work for NHS myself. This experience fell far short of what I would expect and what I would want my own patients to feel. Deciding to call 999 is a last resort, made by people who feel desperate, and in need of serious help, in one way or another. I was too ill to say anything at the time and too shocked. This was not the approach that is widely shown on heart warming tv documentaries! I felt like a time waster, even though it transpires I probably need surgery. Ambulance and A&E staff do a tremendous job - but they must never lose empathy for the patient's fear, pain and predicament in the few brief minutes they come into contact with them. Or condescend their pain and vulnerability. Being glib and treated as a job number, as opposed to caring for the individual presenting, is never acceptable.

The nurse (male) wouldn’t let me speak and didn’t want to know what medicines I took (note that I’m diabetic). Later I was called for an Electrocardiogram and the nurse who was going to perform it was eating and talking to his colleagues, all with the curtains open. Then, he asked if I wanted to put on a hospital gown, but when I said no, he noticed I wasn’t wearing a bra and made me put on one anyways (I like to think they have seen patients naked before?). But the last drop was when he was about to do a blood test. I have constant blood tests as a diabetic person and told him my good arm is usually the left one as my veins (and my whole family’s) are hard to find. He ignored me and said it varies from who’s doing the test and went on to put the elastic band on my right arm (without even looking at the other one). He left the room (while having me with the band and my arm swelling, still talking to his colleagues) to get a needle, and when I asked him to please let me know when poking he laughed and asked if that’s not how they did it in other places. Finally, he pinched me and, surprise, no blood was coming out, as it always happens on my right arm. Then instead of taking the needle off he started moving it around and poking it in and out until I started having an anxiety attack and asked him to remove it as it was obviously not working. After that he left and someone came to listen to my chest and I tried to tell them I had used a bronchodilator before coming but he said it didn’t make a difference.

","body":"I have been a patient of the surgery for the last 9 years. Virtually as soon as they moved the Practice to the new, purpose built building - I can't get appointments to see my Gp. I have spent several hours trying to get through to the Surgery - at 8am, as you have to if you need an appointment with a Gp - or even a prescribing Nurse. Then you still don't get one!\nEither because \"They've all been booked up, and no, I can't book you one for tomorrow! Sorry, you'll have to ring back at 8am tomorrow!\"\n\nNow, I am guessing that the real reason is that Knebworth Surgery - which now has a Waiting Room capacity for at least 50 patients (as opposed to Station Road's 15 if you were lucky!), is actually usually pretty much empty, - because there are only 2 part - time Gp'sworking there!\n\nSo, from the Station Road site's at least 4 or 5 Gp's - most of whom I believe were full time, it has shrank dramatically in the number of patients they are capable of seeing.\nThis, perhaps wouldn't be too bad - if the population of Knebworth and it's surrounding cachement area had dramatically shrunk. Unfortunately the complete opposite has happened - A huge new number of patients (all retirement age, and over) must have / be in the process of registering as new patients - from the new Residential Home in the High Street, from the other Residential Home on London Road, and all of the other new properties which are / are being proposed to be built in and around Knebworth!\n\nI understand that the original Office Manager has now left the practice (probably had enough of being shouted at!), but 2 New \"Management Consultants\" have been appointed. I have just One question for them - \"What are you actually doing?!\nWhat I mean is basically Why does Knebworth Surgery only now have 2 part-time Gp's and virtually No Availability, whilst the erm, other part of the practice (and indeed rather strangely, where the Head of the Practice is based) have at least double the number of Gp's? They have a waiting room for ooh, at least 10 patients (or less), and the last time I was forced to get there for an appointment, which could not be booked by The Knebworth surgery, the actual Reception had been deliberately Boarded Up!\n(I am sorry for saying this, but the place reminds me of those old Council Toilets which were boarded up to try and prevent Vandalism!)\n\nNow I realise, and apologise to, some residents of Marymead, but there are several other Gp Surgeries in the same area - the closest I think is less than half a mile away. I am not suggesting that every patient who uses the surgery will have suitable transport to get them there - but actually neither have I, to make the far longer trip from Knebworth!\n\nSo,I would just like to ask (The head of the entire practice, and the new Managers - Why build a new building to be capable of receiving the number of patients who would desperately (read all the other reviews) love to be able to actually see a Gp or Nurse without needing to travel to MMead?

I had a appt with a physician who after call said she would arrange an appt with a doctor as the advise passed on by my own doctor was not acceptable. I received a iron infusion a while a go due to my body not absorbing iron and advised by consultant I would probably need another one in the future. Blood test last Nov showed very low levels of ferritin (though I was not advised till recent appt with physician) identifying I would need an infusion (if my file had been read) I receive a prescription for iron tablets. The Physician advised as my haemoglobin was ok maybe I didn't need an infusion, I advised her that it was ok last time, she checked and said oh yes.  I ask to go back on HRT and advise passed on from my doctor was no, you can go on an anti depressants !! just wow. I receive a text for telephone appt, I call and wait forever to advise the receptionist I was to have a face to face, you can't was the response, you have to be triaged first, I have I responded. I asked for the doctor to be emailed to advise as told by the physician, chased twice. Still nothing, my telephone appt is next week. Had an appt on the 10th for B12 told by receptionist I was a no show, I showed her my text showing the time of appt and she said, you were a no show. I said my appt is in 10 mins, no it was changed, I was not aware, no apology just blamed the nurse. I have been at this surgery since it was opened. Absolutely appalling service, the staff need customer service training and should remember that patients maybe in a vulnerable place and kindness and manners go a long way. I sent an email last year to the practice manager, no response. I asked that the practice manage call me last year, nothing, I asked to speak to her or an email address recently so I could let her know how I had been treated. You will have to make a complaint came the reply. So seeing the responses on here to say we are sorry, if you could contact the practice manager is laughable.

The best and quickest way to speak to a Dr is via Doctrin. \nIn the most recent instance of needing to see a GP, a week after completing a course of antibiotics for a chest infection that had been diagnosed and prescribed by a Dr (on the phone) the day after I'd - as usual - contacted the surgery via Doctrin. My medical history was not known by the Dr who phoned me initially, nor, it appeared to me, was the fact I am a laryngectomee, although I made it clear in the information given by mr on the Doctrin form. I don't think she'd had time to read the form fully or look at my records. She also may not have treated a laryngectomee before.\nMy second approach via Doctrin was because, having completed the antibiotics and still having the infection,  I thought I required more help. The GP phoned the next morning and after our conversation, she offered me an appointment that day. I am sure seeing me for the first time, the GP found it easier to understand my problem and acted accordingly and I felt she was more aware of facts having seen me. \n Being a laryngectomee means I breath through my neck and speak differently and if this is not known or understood by a GP who hasn't met/ spoken to me before, it causes me extra stress and I am sure must cause some to the GP.  I was far more confident seeing her than I had been with a telephone consultation. \nBut if the initial telephone consultation had been with a GP who knew me and had treated me over the many years I have been a patient at the surgery, it would have been far better.

While explaining how unhappy I am in life due to my quality of life, and that I believe there is something that hasn't been diagnosed causing the issue, the consultant asked me \"why do you want a label for it?\" Aside from the fact that that's why people come to hospitals, to be diagnosed and treated, I was insulted that my in-depth answers were taken and ignored. I was treated with no compassion or understanding and am still having to put up with daily debilitating chronic pain, lack of energy, and having little to no restorative sleep. His solution was a body reprogramming course for I weeks, reading online materials, and no  helpful medication or route to insomnia diagnosis and treatment. I can't be the best father to my 3yr old daughter, or the best partner to my woman, I barely shower or keep basic routines, and I can barely do any housework. I'm bedbound exhausted 14-18 hours a day with pain and no sleep, yet I'm expected to take up an 8 week course. Yet another specialist unit, another appointment, and yet again, I feel unlistened to, not taken seriously, and like I'm unable to get my life back. I hope others aren't in the same boat. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, Gainful Excersize Therapy, Body Reprogramming. These are not helpful therapies, and has been proven time over. Nice guidelines even stopped suggesting them! I asked to be taken off of the duloxitine as it's being used off-label for pain management but it's effects aren't noticed by me - the person I saw ignored that too. Recent studies also show chronic pain users that are perscribed antidepressants for off label pain management, 71% of patients end up with dementia or other memory issues. I'm heavily disappointed in my experience, and want to be taken seriously but this appointment has been more of the same previous experiences I've had. \nI understand I have neuropathic pain, but I also have chronic back and neck pain that the gabapentin simply won't touch, or my damaged knees and hip, or my burning feet, or lactic acid build up in muscles from simply walking 50 meters.
