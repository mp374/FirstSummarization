The poor patient experience comes as a result of the booking system for appointment and lack of understanding from some reception staff.  \r\nA recent change is the requirement to phone at 9am each morning to secure an appointment with GP and I explained that it is difficult due to work pattern. I have tried unsuccessfully on 3 occasions this week. The system to book online is also unavailable to me as the reception staff did not have the paperwork available for registration.  \r\nSo stressful and disappointing as when you do get to see a GP they are exemplary.","criticality":"minimally critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-02-04T16:20:10.65","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-05-25T12:20:02.17","readBy":[{"name":"Public Health Agency","count":3}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/739308","id":"739308"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/739308/responses","id":"739308"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/739308/healthservices","id":"739308"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/739308/tags","id":"739308"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/nigp-pe1015","id":"nigp-pe1015","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stressed","id":"stressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gp","id":"GP"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reception","id":"reception"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/responsiveness","id":"responsiveness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attitude","id":"staff attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/the%20change","id":"the change"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassionate","id":"compassionate"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/771193","id":"771193"}]},{"id":770073,"author":"Proud oarent","authorRoleId":3,"authorRole":"a parent/guardian","title":"Palliative care for our  daughter","body":"The whole team and I do mean everyone are just amazing.

They didn't mention her broken teeth but asked what dentist she was with. I mentioned that my daughter was in a lot of pain and when told we had nothing but paracetamol to use for this, a prescription for codeine was written out.  \r\nWe attended the dentist appointment a few days later who said my daughter should attend the maxillofacial unit at Ninewells hospital Dundee as an emergency patient. The doctor who examined her said there was definitely something wrong and that we had to make our own way to the dental hospital in Dundee for x-rays.  \r\nWe found out that my daughter had a broken mandible on the right side and also a fracture on the left hand side of the mandible, she was asked to stay overnight for surgery the next day my daughter felt she couldn't do this but arranged to come back the following day for surgery and this is what she did. Wires were put in.  \r\nThings have went from bad to worse when we attend this surgery now because I already tried to report what happened initially and on other dates for removal of stitches and because of problems with constant infections. I'm constantly being asked what I think should happen when we attend for appointments now. It's as if we're being blamed for the neglect that happened in the first place and how dare I report it. We attended Arbroath Infirmary on more than one occasion because constant infections only to be told there was nothing wrong with the incision and the weeping was normal.  \r\nThere is more to this story and from doctors who we felt turned this around and onto the patient and her family, to nurses telling me I'd do any for my child but not explaining what they mean.

It was a warm and friendly environment and we did not feel there was a rush to leave until we were ready.  \r\nI really appreciated the great service provided and am very thankful for the organised and efficient manner used to treat my Mum.  \r\nThank you so much.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-05-13T11:45:18.96","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-05-26T14:43:06.697","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lanarkshire","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/769041","id":"769041"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/769041/responses","id":"769041"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/769041/healthservices","id":"769041"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/769041/tags","id":"769041"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l308h_303","id":"L308H_303","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nervous","id":"nervous"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/biopsy","id":"biopsy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/efficient","id":"efficient"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/family%20centred","id":"Family centred"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/haematology","id":"haematology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/informative%20staff","id":"Informative Staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/person-centred","id":"person-centred"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thankful","id":"Thankful"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/770163","id":"770163"}]},{"id":770027,"author":"Steak Pie and Mash","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"a positive experience","body":"In 2019 I saw Dr Yeoman at Bourtreehill Medical Practice for mental health problems I was experiencing.

This had such a positive impact for me and I was lucky enough that Lisa was on shift when I went into labour.  \r\nThis massively reduced the worry I had felt about labouring on my own until my partner could be with me and giving that these restrictions may be in place for some time I think it would be extremely beneficial for any pregnant lady to receive consistent care from the same midwife through pregnancy and labour when possible as it can be quite a vulnerable time for any lady and I know it can be quite anxious to think that you cannot have a birthing partner until you are in active labour. I was really anxious to leave my partner knowing it may be hours or longer until I would be able to get support from him however having Lisa look after me eliviated that stress.  \r\nLisa has also been part of my aftercare and has visited me on two of my appointments which again i was not expecting as I am not in her catchment area but having the same midwife who delivered your baby also doing your aftercare and understands any questions or concerns I might have has made my experience so positive.  \r\nI understand that this is something that is being piloted at the moment and it has been luck that I have gotten the same consistent care through my pregnancy and labour but I absolutely recommend this type of care and I don't feel I would have had such a positive experience without it.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-05-25T13:14:16.29","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-05-27T12:27:06.063","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":8}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/770103","id":"770103"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/770103/responses","id":"770103"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/770103/healthservices","id":"770103"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/770103/tags","id":"770103"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/c418h-commaternityunit","id":"c418h-commaternityunit","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/aftercare","id":"aftercare"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/answering%20questions","id":"answering questions"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/antenatal","id":"antenatal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/birth","id":"birth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/continuity%20of%20care","id":"continuity of care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fortunate","id":"fortunate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/labour","id":"labour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lucky","id":"lucky"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/midwives","id":"midwives"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pregnancy","id":"pregnancy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/understanding","id":"understanding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/quality%20care%20and%20support","id":"quality care and support"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/770193","id":"770193"}]},{"id":770104,"author":"Johnjohn","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Ward 32","body":"I was admitted to ward 32 in March at 07.40.

In the initial probably 15 weeks we felt really let down after things being cancelled, not being told when I had an infection detected after sample, midwives repeatedly forgetting to give me the jabs they said I had to get, midwives changing and generally just feeling like we didn't know whether we were coming or going.  \r\nThe 3rd midwife (& thankfully the last 1) was Kirstie based in Udston Hospital Hamilton, and I cannot praise her enough. Through every appointment the care, friendliness and professionalism shown to us was amazing. I didn't have the easiest pregnancy but she was with me every step of the way and nothing was ever a problem for her. And then with the covid situation nothing changed (other than the mask) she was still amazing and even more reassuring given the worry I had with going to deliver during this time. Kirstie is a true asset and she is made for the job, even after having our baby girl she has been amazing with making sure we had everything sorted as we were changing areas so it got a bit complicated, but she didn't need to help us with this but she did off her own back.

I was worried and scared, due to the ongoing covid19 situation i was expected to go in alone. I didn't want my partner not to be allowed in, how could i do this alone? I didn't know what to expect regardless of my wonderful midwife putting my mind at ease, this wasn't going to help. So as I walked up to the doors and said my good byes I went into the ward.  \r\nI was shown my bed, it was by a window I was so thankful for a window. I was overwhelmed with sadness as I was now alone. After I had a moment (they must have Known) I was fine. The ward held four beds, each midwife, nurse and auxiliary staff member came to say their hellos and this really helped me massively, I didn't feel like I was alone anymore.  \r\nWe quickly started the process, I was put on the monitors and everything was explained to me what will happen. So I got comfortable, I was safe and being looked after. Everything went well and the pessary was placed and now it was time for the wait.  \r\nYou could tell that the staff was overwhelmed due to the new rules, pending threat of the virus and colleagues being off, however, don't take my words negatively, their care for me was never rushed, never lacked and they were always cheerful and happy to talk to me. They were at the beginning of a very unusual time, something we have never dealt with the likes before.  \r\nI got a lovely lunch and dinner, all the time I was looked after and informed as to what was happening. I remember one midwife as she shared a name with my late gran Elsie she was just lovely, but everyone was.  \r\nI settled in thinking I was in for the night, however, I started to feel uncomfortable around 8 and I was given paracetamol without hesitation. As the contractions got further along I was given more pain killers as required. I was really sore but had maxed out on what I could have at around 1ish, this was time for the bath. Normally I love baths, I was reluctant as I was sore and couldn't think of anything worse. They convinced me to take one, it wasn't so bad, in fact it took my mind off it momentarily, however, I felt ill and had to come out.  \r\nIt was time to examine me and thankfully I was a couple of cm, and not long after that I was 5cm. I was so happy I was getting my partner back. So I was helped along the hall and taken into this huge birthing room. It was so clean, organized, I felt safe and my partner was now rushing over to meet me. I had a lovely midwife in with me keeping me sane.  \r\nShe had me rigged up with the gas and air in no time and was monitoring me. I was offered the holy grail the epidural, and I accepted.  \r\nMy partner was there, the atmosphere was relaxed (other than the pain of the contractions), I was even offered to have my drinks put in the fridge to keep them cool. This small little act was above what I expected I was so happy.  \r\nThe anaesthetist showed up, this bit was a bit of a blur my contractions were strong and close together, however, after I got my jag. As we were about to get started with my epidural unfortunately he was called away to an emergency section. I was fine, someone else needed it more, because he wasn't long out the room when I needed to push!  \r\nI still feel I need to appologized for my awful language during contractions, but everyone was just so lovely took it in their stride.  \r\nAt 7:44am my daughter was born 8lb 3oz 65cm a perfect tiny girl.  \r\nI got my skin to skin, we spent time staring at her. The midwives were just amazing, it was over I wasn't in any more pain. In our room, our perfect bubble you wouldn't know we were at the start of a lockdown, a pandemic.  \r\nThe aftercare was super, we got the room for hours, we were fed and I got a shower. Then it was time to go home.  \r\nThe care I received was second to none, other than my partner not being there during induction you wouldn't know a pandemic was going on. You wouldn't notice any difference and this is down to the midwives, nurses and auxiliary staff. Their care was exceptional, they looked after one anxious first time mum and I am so grateful to every last one of them. My only regret is that I didn't retain names (my memory is the worst). My care I have received from Wishaw has been wonderful, they took care of my during previous miscarriages, scans and physio appointments. Everyone I have met or dealt with has been informative, helpful, kind and put me at ease. I have never felt rushed or forced into any unwanted decisions. I would highly recommend the whole department to anyone who is expecting or planning.  \r\nThank you, you are all super heroes. I wanted to send flowers but my order was cancelled due to the restrictions. I hope my story, my experience is enough to let you know how grateful I really am, my whole family is..

He was in a covid assessment ward until tested negative. The hospital staff kept me well informed throughout his stay with the doctors phoning me after ward rounds. This was an excellent practice that should continue after the present crisis as it is often impossible to speak to doctors during normal visiting.  \r\nHe was discharged as soon as he was able with Home Care to complete his recovery. The Hawick Team of 7 staff, an OT and a PT were very professional and supportive to both my husband and I. He required their support for several weeks for personal care and mobility. The delivery of the necessary aids was organised by them and they were promptly delivered.  \r\nAs a couple in our mid 70's it would have been very hard for me to have coped with all that was required on his return from hospital. This may be a new service but in my opinion the excellent staff made a difficult situation manageable and are to be commended.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-05-25T20:41:53.97","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-05-27T13:57:26.513","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Borders","count":10},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/770112","id":"770112"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/770112/responses","id":"770112"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/770112/healthservices","id":"770112"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/770112/tags","id":"770112"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/b105h","id":"B105H","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/b120h_101","id":"B120H_101","score":5},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sb9-community-h2h","id":"sb9-community-h2h","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/crisis","id":"crisis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/infection","id":"infection"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mobility","id":"mobility"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professionalism","id":"professionalism"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attitude","id":"staff attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/urinary","id":"urinary"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/warmth","id":"warmth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/positivity","id":"Positivity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported","id":"supported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support%20for%20family","id":"support for family"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/family%20kept%20informed","id":"family kept informed"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/770195","id":"770195"}]},{"id":770127,"author":"Kiddy 60","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Our NHS is an understandable envy of the world","body":"I had an accident where I broke my toe and after phoning 111 I attended the Victoria hospital in Kirkcaldy later that day. I had my foot x ray’d and strapped and received an invitation by mail within 2 days for an appointment for a check up the following day. The consultant reviewed my foot and x rays and suggested surgery to fit a wire into my toe to help re align the bone to knit correctly; which he confirmed within 30 minutes was arranged for the following Monday at the minor surgery day care dept.  \r\nI have been fortunate enough not to have to attend a hospital for anything other than visiting friends or relations for over 30 years, so it’s fair to say I was apprehensive prior to the appointment. I needn’t have been concerned, as the staff were all fantastic.  \r\nHaving turned up at 7:45 for registration, I was in theatre by 9:30, out by 10 and discharged around 12 noon, aided by the fact that the surgeon recommended at my pre op discussion that the op could quite easily be done under local rather than general anaesthetic. Not exactly what I wanted to hear, as my apprehension was Initially suppressed by the thought that I would be completely unaware of events in surgery, which would now not be the case. It’s now 24 hours post op and while my mobility is somewhat curtailed, I am in no discomfort whatsoever, and believe my convalescence will be short and lead to a completely successful operation. I can’t thank all the staff at the hospital enough for their attention, assistance and professional dealings with me, in particular Andy and Alison who I think were the staff nurses in the day intervention area, John, who kept me calm on the short journey to and from theatre from the day bay, and to Mr Annan, the surgeon who performed the operation on my toe. And my gratitude also extends to Alison ? the assistant anaesthetist who was a big calming influence on me during the operation.  \r\nThank you all.  \r\nThe experience has only reinforced the reputation In my mind that our NHS is an understandable envy of the world and quite simply a superb service from a dedicated, trusted and enthusiastic group of people. I appreciate and a knowledge that there are a large group of people who operate in the background to support the few names I have mentioned above, and they too should be extremely proud of the work they do on a day to day provision that just delivers.  \r\nSo just a big Thanks to everyone from a very appreciative recipient of your service","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-05-26T10:28:09.27","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-05-27T14:01:29.933","readBy":[{"name":"NHS 24","count":15},{"name":"Fife Health & Social Care Partnership","count":4},{"name":"NHS Fife","count":19},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/770127","id":"770127"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/770127/responses","id":"770127"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/770127/healthservices","id":"770127"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/770127/tags","id":"770127"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/f704h_180","id":"F704H_180","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/f704h_day_surgery","id":"F704H_Day_Surgery","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/nhs24-111","id":"NHS24-111","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/apprehensive","id":"apprehensive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/accident","id":"accident"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anaesthetic","id":"Anaesthetic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anaesthetist","id":"anaesthetist"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/attentive","id":"attentive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bone","id":"bone"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/caring","id":"caring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/concerned","id":"concerned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/day%20surgery","id":"day surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/foot","id":"foot"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/minor%20surgery","id":"minor surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/operation","id":"operation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professional","id":"professional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgeon","id":"surgeon"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sympathetic","id":"sympathetic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/timely","id":"timely"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/toe","id":"toe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/x-rays","id":"x-rays"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appreciative","id":"appreciative"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/calm","id":"calm"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gratitude","id":"gratitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20nurses","id":"staff nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/experienced","id":"experienced"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thanks","id":"thanks"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/770192","id":"770192"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/770457","id":"770457"}]},{"id":770113,"author":"ahyes","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"My appreciation for the response to my calls","body":"This is a simple story, no drama. &nbsp;

I did not then have to go over everything again which really helped.  \r\nEven just to receive a follow up call after my treatment had ended has really helped just knowing they still care for that i am grateful thank you.  \r\n","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-05-26T12:23:35.9033333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-05-27T14:18:08.373","readBy":[{"name":"Six Degrees Social Enterprise","count":4}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/770133","id":"770133"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/770133/responses","id":"770133"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/770133/healthservices","id":"770133"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/770133/tags","id":"770133"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/six-degrees-iapt","id":"six-degrees-iapt","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/continuity%20of%20care","id":"continuity of care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/follow%20up","id":"follow up"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/770703","id":"770703"}]},{"id":770122,"author":"RMC85","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"My midwife, our friend and rock","body":"Our midwife from Bellshill Medical Centre was amazing, we loved her, to say we will miss her is and was an understatement. She was friendly, open, honest and everything and more to us.  \r\nI had two previous miscarriages, one was a missed miscarriage and required that i have surgery so I was very anxious and nervious with my current pregnancy. Our orginal midwife was leaving Bellshill medical center and she was replaced I had a couple of temporary midwifes at the first few visits (who were all great also) but then we got assigned to Alana.  \r\nFrom the first appointment we knew she was going to be great. She chatted away to us, she was just so warm and welcoming. No question was stupid and she explained everything thoughtfully and thoroughly that we always walked away feeling safe.  \r\nDuring my pregnancy my late gran had taken ill, the night before an appointment I was told she might not make it. I attended my appointment the next day and broke down when asked how I was. Alana was just so lovely and caring that it helped me more than she knows. That was the first day we heard our little ones heart beat for the first time.  \r\nOn every visit we learned something new, Alana allowed my partner to feel the babys head and showed him where baby was sitting. This involvement was precious to him, he treasured it and was excited for more appointments. All my questions and worries were met with a smile.  \r\nOn my last couple of visits at the start of lockdown, Alana was absent, I was told she was ill. We later found out she had covid19, she told us her story, she battled it exactly by the book. It showed how at risk our NHS staff really are sadly. She fell ill and self isolated in her home, one room and ensuite for two weeks. No contact with her family or outside world, all the while feeling terrible and getting food delivered to the door. It just hammered home what was going on and how close it was and is to us. Her story is why its important to follow guidelines she shouldnt have been at risk but was sadly.  \r\nIn the meantime our temporary midwives looked after us. They were great but not Alana, however, we had our beautiful daughter and Alana was back on visits we were chuffed.  \r\nOn our first day/night home we had a hard time with getting our girl to feed. She had a very fast delivery and was very mucousy. This resulted in her being sick and bringing it up constantly. She was born in the morning, fed once at hospital but nothing since so we phoned the hospital in worry that she wasnt feeding. We were hit with a bit of negativity which shocked us due to the exceptional treatment I had had previously. We felt we had let down our daughter, guilty, that we were failures. We told Alana the next day, she instantly put us at ease. She explained that she was fine, we did nothing wrong, as baby was full of mucus she wouldnt be hungry untill it cleared. She was perfectly fine, just give her time and she will be the milk monster that she is.  \r\nWe looked forward to our visits with Alana she answered all our questions again putting our first time anxiety on the back burner and lifted us up with a new found confidence. With everyl ittle worry she was able to explain what was causing the worry, what was happening and that everything was normal.  \r\nI remember from previous visits to her before baby I was due injections to prevent clots that I was to self administer, however, I didnt get any. I said this to her and she confirmed guidelines had changed and that might be why I didnt get them. She however didnt just leave it there she followed it up and found that there was an unfortunate error. She then the next day brought everything to me and showed me what to do. She was so thorough, always caring and nothing was overlooked.  \r\nShe always told us to contact her over anything, one night I was so worried, I had passed a large clot. I messaged her, not expecting a reply till the next day, however, I got contacted back right away and my mind was put at ease once again. That was above and beyond.  \r\nThe sad day came our last visit from Alana and we were so sad to see her go, she really was our rock. She had helped us with silly things like how to bath baby, up to what to do if there is a major issue. She took two first time parents filled with nervousness and anxiety and left us with pride and confidence. She built us up and for this no words can properly describe just how thankful we really are. The care we received was exceptional and shes another hero and major asset of the NHS. Thank you Alana, you will be seriously missed and I hope your other patients treasure you as we have.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-05-26T09:38:49.18","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-05-27T14:23:36.677","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lanarkshire","count":6},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2020)","count":1},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":1},{"name":"Partnership for Change","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/770122","id":"770122"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/770122/responses","id":"770122"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/770122/healthservices","id":"770122"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/770122/tags","id":"770122"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sl9-community-maternity","id":"SL9-community-maternity","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/above%20and%20beyond","id":"above and beyond"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/exceptional%20care","id":"Exceptional care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helped","id":"helped"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/important","id":"important"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/midwife","id":"midwife"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/midwives","id":"midwives"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/miscarriage","id":"miscarriage"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pregnancy","id":"pregnancy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/safe","id":"safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing","id":"amazing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confidence","id":"confidence"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hope","id":"Hope"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thankful","id":"Thankful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20ease","id":"at ease"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/loved","id":"loved"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20worried","id":"not worried"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/770196","id":"770196"}]},{"id":770156,"author":"WatermelonPonies","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"A doctor","body":"I was recently in a&e/cdu (I cant remember which was exactly as was brought in by ambulance and was taken straight through because of Covid)  \r\nI was seen very promptly which was fab in itself. I then had the pleasure of talking to the kindest doctor named Rosie (I believe she was a doctor - in black scrubs!)  \r\nThe first thing she did was reassure me about the fact everyone was wearing face masks/aprons/gloves because of covid.  \r\nI was in hospital because of my suicide attempt & suicidal ideation. Rosie listened to me, and I mean really listened. She payed attention, let me speak and made me feel comfortable. She didn’t make me feel like she was in a rush or that she had better things to do with her time. She didn’t mind sitting in silence when I couldn’t find the words. Rosie encouraged me to stay for the psych team to see me and see what help I could get which I was very reluctant to do having had previous bad experiences but she offered to sit with me when they came (unfortunately this couldn’t happen because her shift ended before they came) and reminded me that not everybody is the same, and this might just be the one time I get somewhere.  \r\nShe also checked in on me often even when she was busy and encouraged me to have something to eat and drink despite not wanting to. I was very upset and incredibly tired at the time and I just want to tell Rosie just how grateful I am for the way you treated me. You are by far the best a&e doctor I have had when I have been in for my mental health. I hope that others follow your lead and treat patients with the same calm, attentive attitude. Thank you so much Rosie. Without you I wouldn’t have stayed in hospital that night.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-05-26T19:17:31.3633333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-05-27T14:26:18.067","readBy":[{"name":"Somerset NHS Foundation Trust","count":6},{"name":"Sheffield University Medical School 2020","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/770156","id":"770156"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/770156/responses","id":"770156"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/770156/healthservices","id":"770156"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/770156/tags","id":"770156"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rh5a8-180","id":"RH5A8-180","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/attentive","id":"attentive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/calming","id":"calming"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/encouraged","id":"encouraged"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/encouragement","id":"encouragement"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kind","id":"kind"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/prompt","id":"prompt"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassurance","id":"reassurance"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/suicidal","id":"suicidal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/suicide","id":"suicide"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/calm","id":"calm"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/770483","id":"770483"}]},{"id":770158,"author":"Thankyou18","authorRoleId":3,"authorRole":"a parent/guardian","title":"From the minute we entered the service was outstanding","body":"My 8 year old daughter fell and had a nasty deep cut on her head.
