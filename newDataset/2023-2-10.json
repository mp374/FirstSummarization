I was struggling with intrusive suicidal thoughts and I’ve spoken to Geraldine in the past and she is one advisor who can always calm me down and make me feel safe, listened to and calm.  \r\nInstead of changing the subject or referring me to other agencies, Geraldine is not afraid to tackle the situation at hand. She is also not afraid to discuss suicidal thoughts when some advisors shy away from this. She helps me untangle my thoughts, she listens to me and makes me feel seen.  \r\nI was in a really bad headspace tonight before contacting Breathing Space through Webchat, and Geraldine made me laugh. She always remembers me as I do her and asks about my cat. It’s the small things that can make you feel cared for. I’m so thankful that I got to speak to my favourite advisor tonight as she got me from feeling very suicidal to laughing and putting a smile on my face. I feel much calmer after speaking to Geraldine and I really hope she gets to know what a difference she makes to my life. She saved my life tonight and she doesn’t even know it.  \r\nI really wish I could meet her in person and give her the biggest cuddle because if I could I would. Geraldine is an absolute credit to Breathing Space and I hope she gets this feedback. I wish her a ton of love and happiness in life.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-02-09T01:55:31.6733333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-02-10T08:52:11.49","readBy":[{"name":"NHS 24","count":23},{"name":"Office of John Mason, MSP for Glasgow Shettleston","count":1},{"name":"NHS Education for Scotland","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1027903","id":"1027903"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1027903/responses","id":"1027903"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1027903/healthservices","id":"1027903"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1027903/tags","id":"1027903"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/nhs24-breathingspace","id":"NHS24-breathingspace","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/advisor","id":"Advisor"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/laughter","id":"Laughter"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nhs111","id":"NHS111"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/safe","id":"safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/suicidal","id":"suicidal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/calm","id":"calm"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20for","id":"cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/smiles","id":"smiles"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thankful","id":"Thankful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breathing%20space","id":"breathing space"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unsafe","id":"unsafe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/listened%20to","id":"listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20well%20cared%20for","id":"very well cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/felt%20seen","id":"felt seen"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1028572","id":"1028572"}]},{"id":1028348,"author":"scoreboardgr47","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Exceptional care","body":"Whilst as a day patient at the dermatology department I became unwell.

Although, unfortunately, I was unable to break the cycle and beat my eating disorders at this time, after nearly 2 years of outpatient care. I started off slow, however after a couple of months I started improving and challenged my eating disorder.  \r\nHowever, in the last couple of months I was unable to resist bad habits with so much pressure going on in my life and began to go in reverse and ultimately feel I got worse. In saying that, this is no reflection of the Eating Disorder staff and team and the care I received from them. They provided so much advice and guidance which I understood and individualised the care to my life and my needs, as one size does not fit all. Sadly, I just couldn't bring myself to fully implement it into my life at this time with so much of life's pressures at the minute, however they reassured me that when I was ready I could try seek help from them again in the future when there was more stability in my life.  \r\nI have to give a huge mention to Pauline, the nurse who delivered almost all of my care and who supported me so much through the process. I know that without her I would be in such a darker place in my life right now, even though I still wasn't able to fully beat it.

Run as far away as possible!","body":"When this surgery was also the walk-in centre, it was the best surgery I had ever been at. Since it is now solely Turner road surgery, I’m not sure how it can even call itself a doctors surgery. \n\nFor over a year I have been actively trying to book an appointment for myself and my son for referrals for an assessment. Everytime, it’s the same answer. No appointments left. I sit on hold for over an hour, every morning I can to be told the same thing. I ring as directed for a prebook appointment and get told there aren’t any left and they don’t know when the next lot will be released. I’ve been doing this routine for over a year now.\n\nIn the 4 years I was on anti-depressants, I never got called in for a review and the reception team wouldn’t let me book one because a gp hadn’t requested it. In this time, I had a breakdown and tried to take my own life because I wasn’t on the right dose. After that incident, I never heard from the gp again until a year after I stopped filling my prescriptions. Oh, and they never sent y prescriptions on time and rarely got the dose right on them either. \n\nRecently, my youngest (4) was sent home from nursery with a fever and a rash. It was the same story, no appointments, no telephone appointments, and no emergency appointments. They offered to book me in for the next day, but honestly I was worried about my child and declined as she needed care now. I then paused and waited for the receptionist to say the obligatory “if you are really worried then you should take her to a&e or ring 111”. She didn’t say anything, no suggestion of how I could get my 4 year old daughter the care she needed. Turns out she had scarlet fever and I had to take her to a&e after ringing 111 because of her temperature. \n\nI have never had a pleasant interaction with the reception team, they always seem uninterested in helping you and treat you like a burden for using their service. I’ve also never seen the same doctor or nurse more than once. \n\nHonestly, run! As far away from this gp surgery as you can. They do not care for their patients in any way possible and everyone I know that is at this surgery has had exactly the same experience as me.

Unfortunately, the clinic location has changed. There are several issues with this move that I believe are negatively affecting staff/patients/clinical efficiency (based on conversations with staff/my experience).  \r\n1.The Carnegie Unit is not welcoming, designed appropriately for effective clinical delivery, and the new location generally sub-optimal.  \r\n2. In the waiting area, the receptionist cannot see everyone (as there’s a huge block obscuring the space). The waiting area is not welcoming/when patients are called (who may be visually impaired/have hearing impairments) they may not make their appointments on time (as they’re not able to see the reception area properly).  \r\n3.The receptionist is now behind glass (making you feel like you’re trying to take out a mortgage at a bank). This first point of contact is critical to a good patient experience and the glass undermines this important relationship.  \r\n4.The former clinic location (downstairs) was much better/more inviting/better designed and most importantly it was clearly a dedicated space.  \r\n5. As this unit is NOT a dedicated space (unlike the former location) staff are having to work in a new area that is not appropriately designed, thus, undermining the timely and effective delivery of care.  \r\n6.It seems as though staff have not been adequately consulted about this relocation and they need to be listened to by senior hospital management right now and moved back to the former location.  \r\n7. Clearly, managing scarcity (economic/space-based/locations in hospitals) is the eternal challenge in the NHS (and there’s always some kind of opportunity cost). To my understanding, this move happened due to bed challenges during the current winter flu season. Guess the move should be temporary then? Either way, the clinic is not welcoming and other patients I chatted with did not like the new venue.  \r\n8. Perhaps most importantly, sexual health is a VERY sensitive area and continuity of care/location continuity for appointments is critical from the patient perspective. This move to the Carnegie Unit should be reversed as soon as possible.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-02-09T09:48:59.9066667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-02-10T11:05:01.827","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Fife","count":8}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1028041","id":"1028041"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1028041/responses","id":"1028041"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1028041/healthservices","id":"1028041"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1028041/tags","id":"1028041"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sf9-sexual-health","id":"SF9-Sexual-Health","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frustrated","id":"frustrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sad","id":"sad"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stressed","id":"stressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/worried","id":"worried"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/all%20staff","id":"all staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/continuity%20of%20care","id":"continuity of care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/location","id":"location"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sexual%20health","id":"sexual health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting%20area","id":"waiting area"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/clinic%20location","id":"clinic location"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/service","id":"service"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care%20from%20staff","id":"care from staff"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1028773","id":"1028773"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1028787","id":"1028787"}]},{"id":1028042,"author":"Decemberbabies","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Skilled, knowledgeable and kind staff","body":"My care throughout my pregnancy was exceptional from my community Midwife Hannah in Airdrie to my consultant, Dr Malcolm. Hannah was knowledgeable, patient and kind throughout my pregnancy and it was because of her actions that I was scanned by Dr Malcolm at 37 weeks, some issues were identified, and I was brought in for induction.  \r\nThroughout my induction I received amazing care from Karen, Lauren and Kerry-Anne, among others, before being taken round to Labour ward.  \r\nIn labour ward I was looked after by Eleanor and Amy. Words can’t describe how grateful I am to them. It was thanks to Amy’s actions that the fact my baby was in distress was identified and I was given choices regarding what could happen next by medical staff. I was kept fully informed and felt involved in my care and the decisions.  \r\nI was taken to theatre for an emergency GA section, which was a very scary experience, but Amy and the theatre team were amazing and I felt me and my baby were in the safest hands.  \r\nI was in for a few days in postnatal and the care I received was first class.

Thank you to everyone who looked after us, you are all truly amazing.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-02-09T09:57:36.79","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-02-10T11:15:40.55","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lanarkshire","count":6}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1028042","id":"1028042"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1028042/responses","id":"1028042"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1028042/healthservices","id":"1028042"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1028042/tags","id":"1028042"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l308h_501","id":"L308H_501","score":5},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sl9-community-maternity-airdrie","id":"SL9-Community-Maternity-Airdrie","score":3},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scared","id":"scared"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/consultant","id":"consultant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency","id":"emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/induction","id":"induction"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/informed","id":"informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/involved","id":"involved"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kind","id":"kind"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/knowledgeable","id":"knowledgeable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/labour","id":"labour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/level%20of%20care","id":"level of care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/maternity","id":"maternity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/midwives","id":"midwives"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/patient","id":"patient"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/postnatal","id":"postnatal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pregnancy","id":"pregnancy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/safe","id":"safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/section","id":"section"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1030400","id":"1030400"}]},{"id":1028071,"author":"listenwk65","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"My care has been exceptional!","body":"I came into hospital to have a large ovarian cyst removed.

I have been an alcoholic for many years, putting myself in dangerous situations. I tried to commit suicide twice, drinking alcohol like it was going to go out of fashion lying to my kids saying things like I never spent the rent. In hindsight, I'm teaching them to tell the truth, and there's me lying so I decided to cut down on alcohol myself - which made me feel ill. So I went to the doctor's and they told me I was going through withdrawals and they sent me to the hospital. I went to the hospital for 3 days and they gave me a small detox which didn't work because soon as I left the hospital I was straight at the off licence to buy my drink. They then referred me to CGL which was the best thing they ever could do for me. Just amazing people and helped me loads, Lisa is fantastic she knows how much I can deal with. They referred me to Park House which I was scared to go, but still went and I thank god I did. When I came out I was asked if I wanted to go on to the day programme and I had heard loads of bad things about groups, that they don't work etc etc, but I still did it and I'm glad I did because I learnt so much. They have fantastic understanding, the team has great people and within the group you don't get judged. My confidence was so bad but they built me up and if whoever is reading this has the opportunity to do the day group - take it with both hands like I did because it helps, and every time you sign out you always take at least one thing with you. I was asked if I wanted to do the 12 weeks instead of the 5 and I did, and now I miss waking up in the morning and signing in to check in to see how all the amazing people are working on their journeys. I do still do zoom on the Thursday group to stay connected which is really good and worth a try too. I also do the art group on the Friday at East hub and I recommend that to anyone. Now I can say I'm a recovering alcoholic I've been sober for nearly 4 months and still taking it one day at a time.I wish everyone courage to go through their journey with all the help from CGL you will get there so let's all spiritually stand together and kick our addictions.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-01-31T11:14:06.7566667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-02-10T11:24:41.653","readBy":[{"name":"Change Grow Live","count":5}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1024127","id":"1024127"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1024127/responses","id":"1024127"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1024127/healthservices","id":"1024127"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1024127/tags","id":"1024127"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/nms-cglb","id":"nms-cglb","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/alcoholic","id":"alcoholic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/courage","id":"courage"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/detox","id":"detox"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/groups","id":"groups"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/help","id":"help"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/referral","id":"referral"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confidence","id":"confidence"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fantastic","id":"fantastic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/online%20meetings","id":"online meetings"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1032252","id":"1032252"}]},{"id":1028072,"author":"Troonron","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Joint pain","body":"Suffered with shoulder pain for months, got a appointment with Mr Jones at Templehill Surgery - listened, checked me over, found problem, and gave me exercises to improve joint 😁 happy days 👍","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-02-09T10:54:32.55","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-02-10T11:27:15.41","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Ayrshire & Arran","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1028072","id":"1028072"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1028072/responses","id":"1028072"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1028072/healthservices","id":"1028072"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1028072/tags","id":"1028072"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sa9-gp","id":"sa9-gp","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gp%20surgery","id":"gp surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/joint%20pain","id":"joint pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/shoulder","id":"shoulder"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cared%20for","id":"cared for"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/listened%20to","id":"listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nothing%20too%20much%20trouble","id":"nothing too much trouble"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1028570","id":"1028570"}]},{"id":1028148,"author":"pelicanhm49","authorRoleId":8,"authorRole":"a staff member posting for a patient/service user","title":"There really is nothing more you could ask for","body":"I have had a very good experience in male medical.

We had to rush to Fetal Medicine in Belfast to confirm and then fly to London for surgery. The staff throughout were amazing and comforting.  \r\nAfter the surgery we were seen weekly by Fetal Medicine in Belfast and the twin clinic in Antrim, things were improving until my waters broke at 22 weeks. I was admitted to Antrim and a few days later I was rushed to Belfast. The whole experience was terrifying, I know the situation was bad but after a few days of no symptoms of labour the doctors starting telling me the worse was going to happen despite nothing changing with my situation, this was I felt unnecessarily upsetting, didn't help it was also my birthday. I was offered the steroids at 23+3, there seemed to be a lot of confusion over what twins waters had broken and it was quite upsetting. I was re-scanned by Belfast when I arrived but they were unsure as both babies had good fluid around them.  \r\nIn Belfast I was admitted to E ward and put in a side room, the staff were amazing and looked after me so well - Maria, Hannah, Deborah and Maeve, as well as Leanne and Kirsty, there were many others but unfortunately I cannot remember their names. The facilities in E Ward were not great, one shower was closed the entire time I was there and often one of the 2 other showers would also be out of order, probably holding out for the new building instead of fixing, but 1 shower for 20 beds was not good.  \r\nI remained on E Ward for weeks, being scanned daily by Helen and weekly at the twin clinic. Helen was amazing, she always made sure I had plenty of good scan photos, she always used their names, it meant so much when we didn't think they'd be coming home, she explained the results of the scans every time and celebrated with me when things started to look better. Dr Murnaghan at the twin clinic was also reassuring without being patronising, she explained the situation well and I always felt better after a twin clinic appointment.  \r\nAt 28 weeks I started bleeding and passing large blood clots, I was sent down to delivery, but as it was a weekend they were trying to hold off as long as possible, the bleeding eventually stopped. On Monday I went for one of my usual scans with Helen where she told me I'd likely be having the twins that day as she suspected Twin Anaemia-Polycythaemia Sequence (TAPS). She comforted me as I cried. She came down to delivery suite with me.  \r\nMy babies were born via emergency c section weighing 667g and 1171g, they were sent immediately to NICU and I was in recovery, I lost a lot of blood and was unable to see the babies for a while, but due to staff shortages this wait was made even longer.  \r\nI was asked to wait until after shift swap, then I asked again a couple hours later and was told one of the babies was coming off the ventilator and to wait. Then I heard nothing for hours and no midwife came near me.  \r\nI tried to find the number for NICU as I was terrified the worst had happened. The midwife returned to me in tears and she said she would call them but she went out of the room again and didn't update me.  \r\nEventually I was told my midwife was in another delivery and I would be moved to the ward. I was assured the babies were okay but I didn't believe anyone as I still wasn't able to see them.  \r\nI was returned to E ward, I cried as they wheeled me down to the shared ward like I was any other new mum. I could hear the babies crying unsure if mine were actually still alive, the staff on the ward were shocked and helped me into a wheelchair so I could see my babies finally 14 hours after having them.  \r\nI spent 2 days on the shared ward, I spent my time in NICU or with headphones with a curtain around me as it was so painful being amongst all the newborn babies. Women with babies in NICU should not be on the ward with babies. I left as soon as I could. I was distraught leaving and was comforted by Hannah and also Maria, who sat with me and shared her story. I will be forever thankful to the staff on E Ward.  \r\nMy twins spent 31 days in the Royal Neonatal unit, where parents are not as involved in care, details about your child's health are not given to you. One of my twins had a large Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) which I discovered when she was moved to Antrim despite me asking in the Royal did she have one!  \r\nThe nurses seems very wary of getting out my smaller twin, I think this was because they were new. Everything changed in Antrim, I was told everything about my babies, I had plenty of skin to skin with both babies, it was easier to express for the twins and overall was a better experience.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-02-08T19:01:12.4233333","progress":"Story has a

I made staff aware of the issues but these concerns were simply dismissed. I spoke to the senior staff member aswell regarding this I was told I wasn't there for my physical health and that I should be focusing on my mental health.  \r\nAt this stage it was afternoon time on day 2 of a 6-day admission. I hadn't even received the basic physical examination, which is conducted on arrival usually. Only on day 3 the duty ward doctor discovered the extent of these clear to the eye injuries and offered to increase my pain medication and suggested Physio input while I was on the ward. This is the funny part the OT had seen me and did an assessment on the first day and agreed I was perfect capable of doing everything for myself when it was apparent this simply wasn't true. I feel that pressure from social work management affected this decision. Otherwise they would have identified these problems, but wrote me off as fit and well and it was only apparent to staff I wasn't when the doctor did a physical examination.  \r\nNow I'm not medically trained but I can tell when someone is in severe pain. I was dismissed by another staff member for even suggesting that someone look at my pain medication and was told it's my fault that my medication was reduced after following an overdose prior to my admission. Basically I felt blamed for my poor mental health and that I had to just get on with the physical pain because I made that poor choice. Talk about working without judgement - not very professional!  \r\nLater I self discharged and staff were happy to let a patient do this even after telling them about a suicide attempt and that I'd had intentions to end my suffering myself.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-02-03T10:18:20.8466667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-02-10T12:07:11.303","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Borders","count":6},{"name":"Scottish Recovery Network","count":1},{"name":"NHS Education for Scotland","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1025738","id":"1025738"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1025738/responses","id":"1025738"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1025738/healthservices","id":"1025738"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1025738/tags","id":"1025738"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/b130h","id":"B130H","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dismissive","id":"dismissive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/judged","id":"judged"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20taken%20seriously","id":"not taken seriously"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/overlooked","id":"overlooked"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain%20management","id":"pain management"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professionalism","id":"professionalism"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/severe%20pain","id":"severe pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attitude","id":"staff attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/suicide","id":"suicide"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blamed","id":"blamed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/injuries","id":"injuries"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1029499","id":"1029499"}]},{"id":1028155,"author":"golfmh94","authorRoleId":3,"authorRole":"a parent/guardian","title":"A fantastic team","body":"My daughter (aged 9) attended an appointment at the local health centre after concerns regarding her mental health, plus the optician had stated that she may have papilledema.  \r\nAt this appointment the GP called the Borders General Hospital to see if it would be possible to get an urgent MRI for her.  \r\nThe GP said she would call me with a potential day/time.

This is considered a very urgent medical case.  \r\nI attempted to call ahead to seek specialist advice, but was firstly cut off after the switchboard, then after finding a number was told by the diabetes specialist nurse admin and that they couldn't help me and I could be waiting hours for a response. There is no direct phone number for the DSN.  \r\nThe staff in A&E were flat out and never stopped; the department was very busy. I spent about 7 hours there and never met anyone specialising in diabetes to help me. My blood/urine test results showed 5 critical results, which I questioned but felt I was brushed off and sent home with anti-sickness tablets. There is a definite fear in HCPs about diabetes if they are not specialists, but to me this is dangerous, negligent care; and doesn’t adhere to the healthcare essentials for people living with diabetes.  \r\nIn general, the A&E department felt like it lacked information for visitors about where to go, what to do and what the process is. I feel if people understood these things better, there might be a smoother experience for all. Particularly for the significant number of elderly patients attending. Some facilities were lacking basic supplies such as toilet roll and paper towels, and were quite unclean.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-02-09T15:56:13.7333333","progress":"Made change","dateOfPublication":"2023-02-10T12:21:55.773","readBy":[{"name":"Southern Health and Social Care Trust","count":9},{"name":"Patient and Client Council","count":1},{"name":"Public Health Agency","count":1},{"name":"Ulster University, Faculty of Life and Health Sciences","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1028260","id":"1028260"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1028260/responses","id":"1028260"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1028260/healthservices","id":"1028260"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1028260/tags","id":"1028260"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_32024_180","id":"ZT003_32024_180","score":3},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_32024-ucc","id":"ZT003_32024-ucc","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/a&e","id":"a&e"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/a&e%20staff","id":"A&E staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood","id":"blood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cleanliness","id":"cleanliness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diabetes","id":"diabetes"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diabetic","id":"diabetic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diarrhoea","id":"diarrhoea"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/facilities","id":"facilities"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/information","id":"information"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ketones","id":"ketones"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/phone%20system","id":"phone system"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sickness","id":"sickness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/specialist","id":"specialist"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/training","id":"training"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vomiting","id":"vomiting"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/type%201%20diabetes","id":"type 1 diabetes"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/clear%20signage","id":"clear signage"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/brushed%20off","id":"brushed off"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1029879","id":"1029879"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1030801","id":"1030801"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1032456","id":"1032456"}]},{"id":1028167,"author":"tennand","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Very satisfactory op and trouble free","body":"Very satisfactory op and trouble free, thanks to Dr Wilson and staff.  \r\nFollow up included Chloramphenicol drops which may have been in a badly manufactured container or may have been difficult because kept in freezer, but I found it very hard to squeeze drops out and they had no/little smarting effect to tell me they had arrived in the right place.

I suffer from migraines but I had never experienced pain like this before it was extremely painful. This frightened me as it was nothing like I’d ever experienced before.  \r\nThe Call Handler transferred me to Nurse Clinician Margaret who was so kind and done a further assessment before arranging for me to be seen at Stobhill Out of Hours Service.  \r\nThe call from GG&C Health Board quickly came through with an appointment for 5 am.  \r\nUnfortunately I couldn’t get a taxi on time to my appointment and where I live there from Stobhill was no alternative transport.  \r\nNow this is where the real credit lies. At 5.15 am Dr Lynch called me and asked if I was okay. I explained the above to her but she was still wanting to assess me in person. I finally made it to Stobhill just before 5.45 am.  \r\nDr Lynch was even kinder in person. She carried out a full Neurological Assessment and reassured me that she didn’t think it was anything sinister. She was calm, kind and made my anxiety lessen, as I was worried. She made me feel so safe in her hands as a GP and she fully listened to my concerns. She arranged for a prescription to be sent to my local pharmacy and gave me some cocodamol. She said if the headache was to worsen I was to attend Accident and Emergency and let them know I’ve already been assessed by Out of Hours.  \r\nI am extremely thankful for Dr Lynch and her kindness towards me. She really did go above and beyond her duty to care for me and she made me feel safe. She also asked about my Mental Health and made sure I was feeling safe before leaving.  \r\nThank you Dr Lynch. I really appreciate your support and most of all your kindness. You are a fantastic Doctor and I hope you get this feedback.

My forward-thinking specialist/surgeon Mr Joyce asked if I would be willing to try a relatively new procedure in the UK when another tumour appeared on my left kidney in 2007 and from there a miraculous journey would start.  \r\nEnter Doctor Wah and her team, a kidney and life saving intervention for me, because not only did they successfully remove a tumour from my remaining kidney in 2008 they spotted a tumour on my pancreas which only the year before my sister had died from, she was in her thirties.  \r\nUsing Radio Frequency Ablation, which in easy to understand terms is the use of needles guided by MRI positioned around the tumour then hooked up to a generator then using heat the tumour is destroyed. No big nasty scars one night in hospital and within two weeks I was back at work full time (I was younger then).  \r\nThe amount of kidney that is lost this way is well under a cm and my kidney function was back to normal within a few days. I cannot express what a game changer this was for me and my family, no long recovery, reduced mental stress and back to the husband and father I need to be. There is nothing worse than feeling everybody else needs to look after you and that I cannot do my job.  \r\nOver the next few years I've had (I like to keep the team busy)  \r\n2016 Cryoablation (extreme cold instead of heat) to remove another tumour.  \r\n2018 Cryoablation yes another tumour.  \r\n2019 Cryoablation you guessed it another tumour.  \r\n2023 Cryoablation this time 2 tumours removed at the end of January  \r\nTotal 6 tumours removed from my left kidney and the function is still good  \r\nand minimum loss of kidney tissue although it might take me 3-4 weeks to be back fully this time (I'm getting a bit older).  \r\nI am very lucky that because of my condition, Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome (VHL), I am regularly scanned for the growth of new tumours, as was my sister, who had five tumours removed by conventional surgery and lost both kidneys. This is not a fault of the surgeons but unfortunately this treatment came a few years too late for her, but we can see from the above how ground breaking this treatment and others like it are to us all.  \r\nIn summery I would like to push for Ablation in any of its forms to become the first choice treatment for kidney tumours and any other areas it can be used in. Not all people grow tumours like I do but, and here is the big but, the NHS need to make this the number one choice as no surgeon knows how many tumours you will get in your life time, you might be lucky and its a one off and a easy operation, but what if you're not?  \r\nWhat if you cannot cope with the stress and the scars of major surgery or the loss of a kidney before you are moved over to ablation. I think the money alone it would save the NHS must be recognised as soon as possible, not even taking into account how much easier it is on us the patient.  \r\nOnce again I would like to thank the Ablation Team and all the help from those at St James Hospital Leeds for keeping me going with such dedication, expertise and kindness.  \r\nKind Regards  \r\n","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-02-09T15:02:30.8566667","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2023-02-10T13:44:48.16","readBy":[{"name":"Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1028229","id":"1028229"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1028229/responses","id":"1028229"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1028229/healthservices","id":"1028229"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1028229/tags","id":"1028229"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rr813_311","id":"RR813_311","score":5},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rr813-radiotherapy","id":"rr813-radiotherapy","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ablation","id":"ablation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cryoablation","id":"cryoablation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dedication","id":"dedication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/expertise","id":"expertise"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/forward%20thinking","id":"forward thinking"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/journey","id":"journey"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kidney","id":"kidney"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kindness","id":"kindness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lucky","id":"lucky"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/rare","id":"rare"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/recovery%20time","id":"recovery time"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/specialist","id":"specialist"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/st%20james%20hospital%20leeds","id":"St James Hospital Leeds"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgeon","id":"surgeon"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgeons","id":"surgeons"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/team","id":"team"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing","id":"amazing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fantastic","id":"fantastic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/rare%20condition","id":"rare condition"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tumor","id":"tumor"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/genetic%20condition","id":"genetic condition"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/life%20saving%20intervention","id":"life saving intervention"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stress%20reduced","id":"stress reduced"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/regular%20scans","id":"regular scans"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/miracle","id":"miracle"}]},{"id":1028619,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Excellent help in a time of need","body":"We had an emergency care situation with a loved one who is registered with the surgery.

The doctor phoned me very quickly, discussed my symptoms, and asked me to come into the surgery for a face-to-face appointment. In the consultation, the doctor was thorough and caring. They phoned the spinal-ortho on-call doctor at Southmead to confirm best next steps, and I was advised to go to A&E for an emergency MRI.\nI was admitted as an inpatient to the hospital that evening for emergency surgery first thing the next day.\nI cannot praise highly enough the speed with which the GP saw me, and the way they treated me both on the phone and in the face-to-face appointment. The GP was absolutely brilliant, and I am so, so grateful to them and Shirehampton Group Practice. \nI hear lots of horror stories about GP surgeries from friends and family, but I am very pleased to say that Shirehampton Group Practice is exceptional.

It’s not just about me it’s about my family too, the people who care about me, my daughter and partner need me.  \r\nI didn’t want to go through the doctors as it can be a long process and I was desperate, but learnt that I could refer myself, making that first phone call to inclusion was the best thing I could have done. I was in a bad place and needed some help. From the first phone call to my very last appointment I’ve felt looked after throughout.  \r\nAfter a few phone assessments and a 3-4 week call once a week to decide which would be the best route for me which was well worth it, I was put on a course for high level CBT.  \r\nI have had this once before so was a bit apprehensive as I found it didn’t help me but this time I wanted it to work, I needed it to work, so I put my all into it.  \r\nAs with everything there are parts that are quite hard but I found this time I was so open and receptive to all the information and tools that were given to me that I really started to enjoy doing it and seeing a difference in the way I was thinking, feeling, approaching and dealing with things differently. And I’d say that the tools given to me on a weekly basis, the one to one face calls and putting hard work in has helped me be at a place where I feel different now and I’m super proud of myself too for getting this far and still putting the hard work in.  \r\nBut, none of this would have been possible without Chris, he is amazing at what he does. He engages and it actually feel like he cares and understands which is so important. He made me feel relaxed from the off and really got me working on things and seeing things from a totally different perspective. Lots of homework was set which is where the hard work is at, but, he made everything seem so simple and doable. He was very supportive and is a credit to your organisation and has helped me no end and for that I thank him. He also has inspired me to want to look into being a therapist myself so I can help others - what a feeling that would be.  \r\nEven at the end of my course I still feel supported. If ever I need anything Chris said to contact the team if I need them, but now is my turn. I suppose you get out of life what you put in. Teach yourself to be you’re own therapist keep using the tools given especially the monthly self assessment looking at things in black and white makes things so much clearer - well for me they do and like I said I wanted this but needed it more.  \r\nI’m glad I made that call because I honestly feel like a different person, so much more strong, equipped and ready for what ever happens and taking one day at a time and excepting that life has lots of ups and downs it’s how we choose to see them and deal with them.  \r\nA massive thank you to Chris and the team at inclusion and if ever you need a trainee give me a shout lol  \r\nMuch love","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-02-09T16:49:25.01","progress":"Story has a

My son is 1 year old and has had this “cold” since October, he has had one course of antibiotics which were prescribed by out of hours as I couldn’t get in at the surgery, surprise surprise.

I asked for an afternoon appointment so my child can be seen as this is in infection as appose to viral (the same as when he was prescribed antibiotics) I was told I cannot have afternoon as they are not released until the afternoon or when the morning slots have filled. Having worked in a GP surgery before I know by about 9:30am latest all morning appointments will fill given the high volume of calls with patients requesting appointment and so I’m pretty sure leaving a gap in a clinic at 8:10am wouldn’t be a problem to fill. So now I will call at 1pm knowing full well by the time I call there will be nothing left as the morning appointments will have filled and the afternoon already released. Given the fact he is 1 year old, I have a 2 year old as well, sitting in urgent care because the GP surgery reception don’t seem to “care” working in a healthcare environment is not practical. I would not recommend this surgery to anyone and in fact I am in the process of finding an alternative.

Thank You.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-02-09T14:52:45.97","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-02-10T14:23:54.75","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":5}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1028225","id":"1028225"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1028225/responses","id":"1028225"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1028225/healthservices","id":"1028225"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1028225/tags","id":"1028225"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/new-victoria-hospital-nm","id":"new-victoria-hospital-nm","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sj9qe-nuclear-medicine","id":"sj9qe-nuclear-medicine","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cancer","id":"cancer"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/conscientious","id":"Conscientious"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/consultant","id":"consultant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diagnosis","id":"diagnosis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctor","id":"doctor"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/excellent%20care","id":"excellent care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/excellent%20treatment","id":"excellent treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kind","id":"kind"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nuclear%20medicine","id":"nuclear medicine"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/oncologist","id":"oncologist"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/oncology","id":"oncology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professionalism","id":"professionalism"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/prostate","id":"prostate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/prostate%20cancer","id":"prostate cancer"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/psa","id":"PSA"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/team","id":"team"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment%20plan","id":"treatment plan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/truly%20grateful","id":"truly grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/recall","id":"recall"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scans","id":"scans"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/consultant%20nurse","id":"consultant nurse"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/well","id":"well"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1030255","id":"1030255"}]},{"id":1028666,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Very good service ","body":"Excellent lately  .. seen physiotherapy and nurse within short period of asking.
