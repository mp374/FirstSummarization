I have lived in Scotland for 20 years and lived within 4 different Health Boards and fully understand there is a lack of Glaucoma specialists.  \r\nJust over 2 years ago I moved to a different Scottish Health Board. My new GP referred me to the local health board to get in to their system and review. Over the last 2 years I have seen a different Consultant at weekend clinics. These Consultants came from a variety of Health Boards across the UK e.g. London, Carlisle. I was told they were working for the local Glaucoma Consultant and these Saturday clinics were being undertaken to ensure the waiting times were kept down but if any problem was detected I would be seen by the local Glaucoma Specialist.  \r\nAfter an emergency admission to hospital for another reason my eye drops were reviewed and changed and my GP wrote to the local Glaucoma Specialist to inform him. I was then asked to attend to see the local Glaucoma Specialist as a new patient who had no hospital notes from the locum private Consultants. Tests done that day showed my pressures were very high, there had been further 13% visual loss in the right eye. Furthermore it transpired none of the locum Consultants had taken the issue of my extremely thin cornea in to consideration at their reviews and had not given me any appropriate review of my previous trabulectomy. The local Glaucoma specialist arranged for me to have urgent laser trabuloplasty to try and bring down pressures. I was fortunate this was done as lockdown started but have no idea if it has been successful yet. The Glaucoma Specialist stated these Consultants ‘do not work for him’ and for 2 years I had received sub-optimal treatment which has caused more eye damage.  \r\nIf I had not had an emergency hospital admission the issue may still have not been detected and continued visual loss. This weekend initiative may result in the Government waiting times being kept in check but if others patients like me have not received appropriate timely treatment what will the clinical effects be and how will it effect their long term quality of life? In addition there is extra pressure put on the regular NHS Scotland Consultants who have to deal with the mistakes. I cannot imagine paying private agency Consultants being a cheap option. Why is the funding for this initiative be put in to frontline eye clinics of the regular Consultants instead?","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-06-22T14:36:26.2366667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-07-10T10:57:07.963","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lanarkshire","count":3},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/773361","id":"773361"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/773361/responses","id":"773361"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/773361/healthservices","id":"773361"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/773361/tags","id":"773361"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sl9-orthoptic-services","id":"SL9-Orthoptic-Services","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/attention%20to%20detail","id":"attention to detail"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/continuity%20of%20care","id":"continuity of care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/glaucoma","id":"glaucoma"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/laser","id":"laser"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/consistency%20of%20care","id":"consistency of care"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/777207","id":"777207"}]},{"id":774224,"author":"serpenswq96","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Calling the out of hours team","body":"Called at 17: 35. Didn't get through as ever, was told to leave a message or phone Rethink/Samiritans. This is immediately a bad start as it indicated my mental was not taken seriously and can be dealt with by non specialists who don't have my medical records to hand and can't really help.  \r\nI don't like phoning the out of hours team as I have had previous issues with lack of service. I've been told by some staff that I have no mental health issues, and by others that I am wasting their time in previous calls. Also I've had the phone put down on me during an episode and yet been told during another call that because I'm calm there's no problem as I'd be angry and emotional if there was. So you can't win with them.  \r\nThey've been the subject of complaints but the reply is always 'you were abusive to us'. When this is challenged by my care workers, who point out I was having an episode and they're trained to deal with this no response is given.  \r\nGot no option but to phone them today as no other help is available. It's now 1747 and they haven't phoned back. I'm sorry the episode I've been trying to hold off all day hasn't happened on a weekday. I need someone really quickly to talk me down, I can't hold in the rage much longer, everything is prickly heat right now and throwing stuff against he wall only wards it off for a few minutes.  \r\n1802 Staff member phoned up. I explained how I've been holding in the rage all day and that I needed someone to talk me down. They said they weren't able to get anyone out to see me (Odd really, as I've seen 2 members of staff out at 1am to deal with someone who put a window through near the Cathedral a while back, but that's not like me, who they can pass on to someone else so there you go)  \r\nThe staff member suggested I go for a walk. I pointed out that I'm trying to hold in a rage here and didn't really want to leave the house in case I had a confrontation. They then suggested I punch a pillow to take away the rage. I said I need to hear something break. They then seemed to take offence at me refusing their ideas and said this is not going to help, saying I had gone in here with an idea of what should be done (Imagine that! ) and they can't send anyone out because they haven't got the resources. I pointed out that's not true and recounted the meeting above, suggested this was won't as opposed to can't. 'welllll' and then I said 'that makes two of us' and put the phone down.  \r\nAt no point did I raise my voice, swear or insult the staff member, I merely pointed out the treatment I've had in the past and, despite more £££ allegedly being put in there it's still the same story, I don't get help from the out-of-hours team as I don't have drug or alcohol issues.  \r\nThey are simply discouraging me from phoning them again.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-06-28T17:33:14.5033333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-07-10T11:05:44.27","readBy":[{"name":"Sheffield Health and Social Care NHS Foundation Trust","count":3},{"name":"NHS Sheffield ICB","count":1},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2021)","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/774224","id":"774224"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/774224/responses","id":"774224"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/774224/healthservices","id":"774224"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/774224/tags","id":"774224"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/tah-out-of-hours","id":"TAH-out-of-hours","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/angry","id":"angry"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ignored","id":"ignored"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/access%20to%20mental%20health%20services","id":"access to mental health services"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/advice","id":"advice"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dismissed","id":"dismissed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lied%20to","id":"lied to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20taken%20seriously","id":"not taken seriously"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/conflicting%20information","id":"conflicting information"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/777778","id":"777778"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/787023","id":"787023"}]},{"id":775221,"author":"intensitycf39","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"A very pleasant experience","body":"In essence my experience today has been excellent... the Ward was easy to find as it was well labelled.

Brin","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Issues with the new appointment system","body":"The care and medical advice provided by the doctors at this practice is good however I don't feel the same about reception.  \r\nThere is an issue with the way the new appointments system has been introduced with no warning or literature to patients, and the way that this has led to reception staff treating people badly.  \r\nI have attempted to use the new eConsult system many times to try and get an appointment and each time it has told me to contact '111'. The only way to get anywhere is to lie and put incorrect information in. Do I need to go through the ordeal of answering over 20 questions when I just want an appointment? If no question is relevant to my issue and it tells me that something is an emergency when it isn't, I don't think it can be considered fit for purpose. I also object to having to detail my private information in this way.  \r\nWhen I've called reception for help, I'm told that I must be doing it wrong and that there is no other way for me to book an appointment. I've pleaded with them to book me a telephone consultation and they have refused. I'm told that because I sound young and because I have an email address that I must be able to use the eConsult system. This is complete nonsense, how can you assume something by someone's voice when you don't know anything about them. I have friends and family in their forties who aren't technically savvy and wouldn't be able to use this system.  \r\nSomething as straightforward as phoning to book an appointment has become a complete ordeal, this is now the 3rd time I have been refused one. Why am I being turned away when I am asking to see a Doctor? It is a perfectly reasonable request to ask for an appointment over the telephone.  \r\nFurther to this I'm told I'm not able to see my preferred GP. I can only see the person that they/the system deems suitable for me. It should be the patient's choice how they want to book to see their GP and now neither eConsult or a receptionist will do this for you. Personally I don't mind waiting longer for a non-urgent appointment with my chosen doctor, but this is no longer an option. Why has booking appointments online been completely disabled? This is yet another option that has been taken away. All the confidence I had in knowing that I could get an appointment easily and being able to see the Doctor I want has completely evaporated.  \r\nI understand the need to modernise services, however, we should have been consulted in advance about this change and it not be just enforced on us. The customer needs time to adjust in a gradual process. Human support and a range of options for booking appointments still needs to be available for patients, and the staff should be far more accommodating in the process, not refusing to make people appointments.  \r\nPlease review how you are doing things and how it makes the patient feel. I have been seriously upset and stressed out by this series of events and if this unaccommodating 'cant do' attitude persists I will have to move to another surgery.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-06-28T14:14:36.3533333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-07-10T12:20:02.86","readBy":[{"name":"Sherard Road Medical Centre","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/774218","id":"774218"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/774218/responses","id":"774218"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/774218/healthservices","id":"774218"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/774218/tags","id":"774218"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/g83027","id":"G83027","score":3},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stressed","id":"stressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20upset","id":"very upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/appointment%20system","id":"appointment system"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctors","id":"doctors"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/patient%20choice","id":"patient choice"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/no%20confidence","id":"no confidence"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reception%20team","id":"reception team"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/econsult","id":"econsult"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/776136","id":"776136"}]},{"id":775445,"author":"Sioban","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Midwifery Care","body":"Kelly is a passionate, caring, supportive and genuine midwife who goes above and beyond for her patient. My experience of being pregnant would have been completely different if it hadn’t been for the kindness shown by Kelly.  \r\nI suffer with anxiety and through my pregnancy this became extreme. I took myself to see Kelly at 24 weeks pregnant and was nervous about speaking up as so often anxiety is seen as just “worrying”. I was terrified I would be seen as dramatic or it be put down as “just something that happened on pregnancy”. However, on speaking to Kelly she instantly made me feel like I was doing the right thing by speaking up, she listened, genuinely listened and completely understood what I was feeling. She suggested that I see her every week for a check up to try and help reassure me that the precious little one in my tummy was ok.  \r\nI felt a genuine connection with her and completely trusted her judgement. She cares for her patients more than any other healthcare professional that I have ever come in to contact with and Kelly is without a doubt, a total credit to the NHS and without her support I don’t think I could have came through my pregnancy so well. She made sure to come and see me when I was discharged from hospital to do my checks and make sure me and baby were ok. Lockdown happened towards the end of my pregnancy and that came as a shock to everyone but Kelly made sure to still call me every week. She is a star, and I can’t speak highly enough of her as a professional, and as an individual.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-07-09T07:09:17.1533333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-07-10T12:39:50.57","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Ayrshire & Arran","count":4},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/775445","id":"775445"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/775445/responses","id":"775445"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/775445/healthservices","id":"775445"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/775445/tags","id":"775445"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sa9-community-maternity","id":"SA9-community-maternity","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/above%20and%20beyond","id":"above and beyond"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/caring","id":"caring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/comforted","id":"comforted"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/genuine","id":"genuine"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kindness","id":"kindness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/midwife","id":"midwife"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/outstanding%20care","id":"Outstanding care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pregnancy","id":"pregnancy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pregnant","id":"pregnant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supportive","id":"supportive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/understanding","id":"understanding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/well%20looked%20after","id":"well looked after"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassionate","id":"compassionate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/passion%20for%20the%20job","id":"passion for the job"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/passionate","id":"passionate"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/776035","id":"776035"}]},{"id":773972,"author":"jadeward186","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"poem from a Jade ward patient / Covid lockdown","body":"Lock Down.\r\nFrightened, Scared.\r\nNot being able to see my family and heroes on other wards.\r\nDRC T.

I am on a medication and have had side affects. In the past the Dr told me to contact them if I had these side affects . I did this via the  Econsultation form. ( by the way the practice website is now just hideously bad in terms of usability ) it is so busy with so many different types of contact here and there that I expect many find it hard to navigate now. I filled my form in and waited for a response I got a phone call that I missed and a voice message left. I phoned back within a couple of hours and was told the person dealing with this was busy but would call me back. They didn’t call back then after another few hours so I called again. Slightly abrupt receptionist said I was on their list for a call back. No call has come. I filled this form in on Tuesday the 7 th and it is now 3 days and I haven’t had a response to my initial concerns. I have access to my notes and saw online that an annotation that a  failed contact and message left on answer phone  was added To my notes but no notes re me calling back 2 times to chase this up. This concerns me greatly as if I did have a problem from not being contacted it would look like I failed to chase this up which I have attempted to do so. All contacts from me to the surgery should be noted on my patient record and if this hasn’t happened it is deeply concerning. So what can I do? I have filled in the form I have chased up after the first missed phone call I can’t really do anything else so I am in limbo. I am ok with technology and cogent of the need to chase a response up but I expect there are many patients at the practice who are not. Covid19 is an unprecedented health crisis but I think that this model of change to a complete  No face to face appointments unless triaged is not really acceptable or it seems not to have worked for me anyway. As a patient I feel disenfranchised of the ability to have the care that best suites me. I hope the practice returns to a more normal model of patient care soon but I doubt this will  happen. I might just be unlucky and perhaps this is working for the majority but for me I don’t like this but I have zero options as this seems to be the only way to access primary health care at present. My main concern though is how 2 contacts from me to the practice have not been recorded in my clinical notes this should never happen and is very worrying form a professionalism view. Notes should always be contemporaneous and yet this don’t happen twice. This needs addressing as a matter of urgency by the practice manager.

It was Easter Sunday 2019, my partner had just picked her mum of from Hospital, she went in on Good Friday, as she hadn’t been feeling too good and with a history of two heart attacks it was for the best.  \r\nWe had just come back from a short break in the Lake District, And my other half was excited to be picking her mum up and telling her all about it.  \r\nShe picked her mum up and dropped her home, spent an hour or so with her to make sure she was comfortable and that her dad was ok. Checking they had got essentials for a few days so they could manage and we could do a shop for them later in the week. When my other half returned home, we ordered a take away and enjoyed the last dregs of the sun in our garden.  \r\nLater that night, my other half phone rang. It would be a call that would change our lives forever, we were about to spend the most traumatic 4 weeks imaginable for us. There was to be no happy ending.  \r\nI could hear the panic in both my other half and her dads voice, this was not good. She told me what her dad said and she left. 10 minutes later she rang in tears sobbing, I said I’m on my way and set off.  \r\nThe journey takes about 20 minutes, it felt longer, taking no notice of anything but just a focus to get there. I pulled up outside the house, there were 2 paramedics crews , my heart sank.  \r\nMy partner's mum had collapsed in the bathroom, fallen against the door effectively locking herself in. Her husband who is not very able had been to his shed a good 30 meter distance from the house and had crow-barred the door off. The paramedics team we’re trying their best to establish what was going on. We felt helpless, what had happened, how, 4 hours ago she was laughing and joking, planning a roast dinner and looking forward to our next visit.  \r\nWe were asked questions about medical issues , lifestyle and general health and wellbeing.  \r\nWhilst we just wandered aimlessly round the house.  \r\nWe were lost upset and just wanted her to be ok.  \r\nAn hour or so later, they made the decision to take her away to hospital, the nearest was 10 minutes not the first choice but as the paramedics said, every second is vital, and within minutes she was taken down the stairs in a stretcher into the back of the waiting ambulance.  \r\nWe waited and waited, the ambulance didn’t move just stood lights and engine on. What’s going on , what’s happening this isn’t good. It felt an age, then they went full sirens, we gave chase.  \r\nThe journey we sat in silence, with our own dark dark thoughts, passing the busy nightlife of the town, how could they possibly enjoying them selves , I felt angry.  \r\nWe arrived at the hospital, made our way to A n E , the receptionist had a look of “I’m sorry for you” on her face as we went to the waiting area. And so began a night of sheer anguish, emotional strain and frustration.  \r\nWe sat and waited, drank tea, drank water, drank more tea, walked outside.  \r\nThis only happens in films I thought, not to us.  \r\nIt does happen it’s very very real.  \r\nWe found out what was going on in the early hours of the morning.  \r\nA staff nurse had stayed by her side, letting us have a quick visit to the cubicle, he was passionate and reassuring, it’s what we wanted to hear. My partner's mum was almost in some activated nightmare, lashing about unable to control her left side, however her right side remained motionless.  \r\nIt was a stroke.  \r\nWe got word a surgeon from another hospital had been called, he would be there within the hour, something he was a specialist in, we had hope, I imagined him with a police escort being driven by a chauffeur, just like a film.  \r\nHe came, he tried , he couldn’t do what he wanted, she would have to be with some considerable risk moved to another hospital.  \r\nWe were told to go home and wait for a call. It was now around 6.30 am.  \r\nWe got in, the house was cold, there was the odd piece of used medical equipment wrapping in the hall on the stairs. What do we do now?  \r\nWe put the bathroom door on, tried to keep busy. Charged our phones and waited and waited.  \r\nWe rang at 11. She had made it and was “comfortable “. Music to our ears. We could go over and visit.  \r\nWe were shown to an ICU ward, My partner's mum was in a gown with like an oven mitt on, to protect her arm as she had been flailing it about. My other half rushed to her and undid the Velcro protecting her fingers and gripped her hand , I well up now just thinking about it. It was difficult. She couldn’t speak or communicate, just stare and try to want to get out of the bed. She couldn’t.  \r\nShe was poorly, very poorly, she had a stroke and heart attack, and her heart had been torn damage was irreparable.  \r\nAnd so then for the next four weeks, we lived on a knife edge, day after day we would get a call, “we think you need to get here now, her condition has got worse “. Each time, we expect the worse, by the time we get there she had stabilised, we wait an hour , sometimes two sometimes 4 until we are content to leave her. This process happens almost every other day for over 3 weeks. Our lives are shot, my other half is signed off work to look after her dad and visit the hospital.  \r\nOne Sunday we get a call. The weather was sunny, it was now May, we were in limbo.  \r\nWe make our way to the hospital, the consultants want to see us. They can do nothing more, they have tried , but she is losing the fight a combination of machine and medicine are keeping her alive.  \r\nMy partner said , what must mum be thinking, this was no way to live. They went to see her, held her hand and gave her a kiss, she looked well , Colour in her cheeks her hair brushed, a glint in her eye, but no smile, a look of confusion and frustration in her face.  \r\nWe will make her as comfortable as we can the consultant said, Ok, you know best.  \r\nWe left, confused, is that it? We waited for a call , it didn’t come that night, my other half and her dad went to the hospital again, she was the same, they spent a few hours, came home.  \r\nMaybe the consultant was wrong? She looked better , no rasping cough, calmer less clammy, still on oxygen but more relaxed looking. We will go again Tuesday, so they did, same , she looked as well as could be expected. We had tea and went to bed.  \r\n23.51 the phone rings. It was my other half’s dad, we had been living these calls for weeks, but this was differs. We drove to his house and he drove us to the hospital. The corridors were silent, mixed with the smell of cleaning fluid and cooked food.  \r\nWe made our way to the ward, after picking up a wheelchair for her dad, into the lift, all in silence.  \r\nWe pressed the ward buzzer, we were greeted by a familiar nurse.  \r\n“I’m so sorry, Jayne passed away 10 minutes ago, I held her hand I didn’t want her to be alone “  \r\nTo us, that’s all we needed. She wasn’t alone and for that we are eternally grateful.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-07-08T15:33:23.5633333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-07-10T15:46:04.257","readBy":[{"name":"University Hospitals of Derby and Burton NHS Foundation Trust","count":2},{"name":"East Midlands Ambulance Service","count":1},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2020)","count":1},{"name":"The Stroke Association","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/775299","id":"775299"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/775299/responses","id":"775299"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/775299/healthservices","id":"775299"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/775299/tags","id":"775299"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rtgfg-ed","id":"rtgfg-ed","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rx9-emergency","id":"RX9-emergency","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helpless","id":"helpless"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/traumatic","id":"traumatic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/alone","id":"alone"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/heart","id":"heart"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/heart%20attack","id":"heart attack"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/in%20limbo","id":"in limbo"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/oxygen","id":"oxygen"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/passed%20away","id":"passed away"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stroke","id":"stroke"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassion","id":"compassion"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hope","id":"Hope"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassuring","id":"reassuring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/relaxed","id":"relaxed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wellbeing","id":"wellbeing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/alive%20again","id":"Alive again"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20nurses","id":"staff nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/passionate","id":"passionate"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/788868","id":"788868"}]},{"id":775860,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Problem","body":"On the 7th July 2020 we submitted 2 requests via the request phone line for repeat prescriptions.
