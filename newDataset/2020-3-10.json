Off the bat the GP whom I had an appointment with made me feel insecure and unsafe, she seemed distant and gave the impression that I was lying to her about why I’ve been feeling this way. She then proceeded to ask me “how would you kill yourself?” which for the record isn’t the best thing you should be asking someone who admits to having suicidal thoughts. I was startled by the severity of this question and fumbled around my answer so she then responded with “you haven’t seriously thought about it then”. By making me feel small and stupid in this moment meant that I didn’t focus on the rest of the conversation because I was so unexpectedly triggered. Another concern is her response to me bringing a close friend with me. I am 18 so don’t need my parents with me if i don’t want them to be with me, i opted to bring a close friend just to feel more secure. For the full appointment she kept referencing snarkily how “if i had brought my parents this would be easier to do”, leaving my friend feeling awkward and unwanted and diminishing how I feel, if someone who is suffering with mental illnesses has brought someone with them it isn’t morally correct to challenge them and tell them to tell more people even though they are visibly uncomfortable. I don’t want to return to the practise any time soon, at the risk of my mental health depleting even more.

It took them a week to realise the antiobiotics are not working, and to advise i need a blood transfusion despite saying my blood levels are very low. Alot of improvement is required on the ward's.

Crimson Hill managers decided to halt it continuously with no promise of when they were restarting it. We were not kept informed. They did not give any indications, just would make it up.

I was told there would be a wait of around 14 months for my first assessment, and then 3-4 months for my final assessment.  \r\n14 months later I had my first assessment, whereupon I was advised to contact iapt. I contacted iapt and they said I wasn't allowed to have focused therapy because I was still on the waiting list at the GIC, but they did help with some basic anxiety counselling.  \r\nThe GIC effectively ghosted me for 18 months. They wouldn't answer my emails and when I called they either asked me to email or told me they didn't have any answers for me.  \r\nEventually, after calling once every 4-6 months for a year and a half, (a time frame which was estimated at 3-6 months) they booked my final assessment.  \r\nAt my final assessment I was told I would have a letter of confirmation within a week or so and then a detailed summary about a month later.  \r\nAfter a month and a half I called the service and was told the letter was still awaiting confirmation. A week or so later I was sent two appointment invites. Neither stated the reason for the appointment. I still had not received any confirmation/diagnosis.  \r\nAs it turned out the first appointment was to discuss hormone therapy, and I there asked the clinician to give me a copy of these letters I hadn't received.  \r\nAlmost a month after the hormone appointment, I got a copy of a letter sent to my GP saying I could start treatment and another appointment at the GIC. I also made an appointment to see my GP, a week after the GIC appointment was scheduled.  \r\nI arrived at the GIC, in the middle of the afternoon,. At short notice, on a work day, to find that my appointment had been double booked and I had to wait an extra 45 minutes anyway.  \r\nWhen I eventually got seen, I was told that this appointment was a 4 month review for the medication I was due to start a week from now, and that I didn't need to be here.  \r\nWhen I went to my GP, they went over the letter the clinic sent, and found that the medication they had recommended no longer existed. Luckily the GP had experience with prescribing trans patients and knew what to switch me to.  \r\nSo to sum up, my experience with Sheffield's gender clinic has been that I feel my time & their time has been wasted for three full years on what essentially could've been a counselling session and a consultation with an endocrinologist. There was absolutely no reason whatsoever for this to go on for the length of time that it did, or for there to be so many steps involved, especially when, after all that anxiety and waiting and stress, their advice was useless and my GP had to take matters into her own hands anyway.  \r\nBut what do I know? I'm not a medical professional.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-03-08T08:02:20.8366667","progress":"Change planned","dateOfPublication":"2020-03-10T13:33:00.227","readBy":[{"name":"Sheffield Health and Social Care NHS Foundation Trust","count":6},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2021)","count":2},{"name":"Plymouth University Health and Human Sciences students, 2018","count":1},{"name":"Healthwatch Sheffield","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/747651","id":"747651"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/747651/responses","id":"747651"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/747651/healthservices","id":"747651"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/747651/tags","id":"747651"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/tah-gis","id":"TAH-GIS","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxious","id":"anxious"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confused","id":"confused"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disappointed","id":"disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frustrated","id":"frustrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stress","id":"stress"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unimportant","id":"Unimportant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/concerned","id":"concerned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/counselling","id":"counselling"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diagnosis","id":"diagnosis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gender%20identity","id":"gender identity"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hormone","id":"hormone"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/messed%20around","id":"messed around"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wait%20time","id":"wait time"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/749318","id":"749318"}]},{"id":748035,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Wonderful care and support","body":"I received counselling over the course of 5 months.

She’d felt unwell with vomiting & diarrhoea for a month but didn’t attend her surgery as getting an appointment is very difficult. She eventually did see the practice nurse who took bloods & contacted her that same afternoon.....her egfr was dangerously low (10) & she was instructed to go to hospital immediately.  \r\nShe was advised to go to the Combined Assessment Unit rather that A&E. The unit was very busy & there were no beds for her. She was cannulated & left on a trolley until she was reviewed at around 6 in the morning (she’d gone in at 7pm the previous night) Surely with her egfr so low, & being advised to go ‘straight to hospital’ by the practice nurse, she required fluids immediately.......not 11 hours after going in?  \r\nShe was given a single room in CAU and advised she would be transferred to the renal unit when a bed became available. My sister & I attended with our dad the next day. My mum looked really poorly, & the catheter she had in was draining very little amounts. It was clear the ward was busy .....most people we tried to ask about mums plan of care replied with she’s not my patient.  \r\nThat night my mum phoned my sister, distressed as no one would answer her buzzer, her cot side had been put up & she couldn’t get to the toilet. She already found it difficult to hold the catheter bag & manoeuvre the drip stand to get to the toilet, without the added barrier of a cot side. She was distressed at this point.....she was still having frequent episodes of diarrhoea & earlier that day hadn’t managed to reach the toilet in time. My sister phoned the ward explaining she needed help. The nurse (a bank nurse we later discovered) then went into my mums room & scolded her, telling her that she didn't need to go to the toilet as she had a catheter in, then pushed my mums torso back on to the bed. Was she completely clueless as to why my mum was there?  \r\nMy mum felt frightened of this nurse after this encounter. After mum said she needed to open her bowels, the nurse finally put the cot side down & let her use the toilet. My sister & I visited the next day, mum was upset, telling us that after my sister had phoned, a nurse or auxiliary (she couldn’t be sure who) went into her room & angrily asked her did you phone your family?! We’ve got very sick people to look after in here! We’ll answer the buzzer when we can, don’t bother your family again.  \r\nHow dare anyone tell my mum not to contact us!  \r\nThe next day my sister, my dad & I arrived at 2pm. Mums toilet was filthy, & had 4 bed pans containing diarrhoea in them (she was on fluid balance & it was to be measured). She was sitting in a chair & we could see the bed sheets were slightly soiled. My sister asked if the toilet could be cleaned & the bed changed, which they duly were. We were grateful to the cleaners & the nurse who changed the bed. We asked all 3 if they could do something about the bed pans in the bathroom, they all said they’d tell mums own nurse.  \r\n2 hours later i asked a nurse at the desk if the bed pans could be removed, she looked up from note writing & said I don’t work here. I was astonished at how unhelpful people were. I understand everyone is very busy, but I felt that was just rude.  \r\nEveryone we’d asked that day to explain what the plan was for mum (& was she going to renal as was discussed previously) said sorry I’m not your mums nurse. The occasional helpful one said I’ll try to find her. We didn’t actually see mums nurse the entire day.  \r\nWe resorted to desperate measures, asking the staff member who brought in dinner if they could try & find someone to remove the bed pans. This staff member said they would try to find someone to do it, but as with all the other times, no one came. In the 3 hours we’d been there, we’d helped mum up to the toilet at least 8 times. Not wanting to fill the entire toilet floor with bed pans of diarrhoea, she’d just gone in the actual toilet. A lot of fluid not measured.  \r\nMy sister went to the desk when she saw a doctor. Again, the doctor wasn’t my mums doctor, but this doctor helpfully brought in mums notes & discussed her care plan with us. We were so grateful to them for filling us in. We also asked this doctor if they could help us identify mums nurse to get rid of the bed pans (6th person we’ve now asked) & explained how upset we were that they’d been in there all day & mums output was being correctly measured. The doctor said they would get the charge nurse to speak to us.  \r\nAbout an hour later, a senior member of staff came in the room, arms folded appearing ready for battle. Their opening to my sister & I was Hi, I hear you have some complaints. Who are you.  \r\nI ask who they were, which seemed to displease this staff member & this set the tone for the discussion. I felt it was completely rude and unprofessional to not introduce themselves to us. My sister & I are both health professionals, I’m certain one of the first things I learnt was to introduce yourself and explain your position at the earliest opportunity.  \r\nWe explained our concerns.....mainly the way my mum was treated by the staff on her first night in the unit & the failure of her nurse that day to monitor her output. This staff member was defensive during the whole conversation and informed us they had no real control over bank nurses, and that our mum's nurse today has been very busy with an extremely sick patients. This staff member then brought out a notepad & said, i see you’ve also complained about the bed not being changed & the toilet not being cleaned., and informed us our mums nurse offered to change the bed in the morning & that our mum declined. And that the toilets are cleaned on a back shift, not before. We felt this senior staff member was trying to insinuate we had a long list of complaints & it felt like they liked those ones because they had answers for us.  \r\nI informed this staff member again that we absolutely weren’t complaining about those things, we asked for the toilet to be cleaned & the bed to be changed which they were, timeously. We received no response regarding the bed pans left in the toilet all day other than the nurse was busy with another very sick patient. What about my mum?? Wasn’t she sick enough to warrant minimum standard of care for her condition......fluid balance?? My sister & I were astounded that we were not once offered concern or an apology, especially for the way my mum was spoken to after phoning her family for help as she didn’t know what else to do.  \r\nMy mum never did get transferred to renal. There was never a bed available. She stayed on CAU for 6 days. I’m pleased to say that after the first 3 day’s the care improved & she was shown kindness from many nurses. Nevertheless, what sticks in our minds is the appalling treatment from night shift staff on her 2nd night & the indifference shown by the senior staff member when we raised our concerns.","criticality":"strongly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-03-08T10:30:05.89","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-03-10T14:18:06.307","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Ayrshire & Arran","count":12},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/747661","id":"747661"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/747661/responses","id":"747661"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/747661/healthservices","id":"747661"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/747661/tags","id":"747661"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/a111h-cau","id":"A111H-CAU","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20upset","id":"very upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bank%20staff","id":"bank staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diarrhoea","id":"diarrhoea"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/drip","id":"drip"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/failure","id":"failure"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attitude","id":"staff attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/749144","id":"749144"}]},{"id":747645,"author":"789","authorRoleId":4,"authorRole":"a relative","title":"Discharged home with no medication","body":"My father was admitted to ward 14e with a severe chest infection and was generally very poorly with no appetite, confusion and poor mobility. These symptoms came on very quickly and it was shocking to see him in such a deteriorated condition. After around 12 days, with not much evidence of any action being taken and conflicting stories from the dr, he was discharged despite my protestations that he was still very poorly. He was given no medication even though his chest and cough still seemed very bad.  \r\nHe had no care support even though I pleaded for some help. He lasted at home for a week before ending up back on the ward. This time more tests were done but I still felt I wasn't really taken seriously when I asked about his physical condition and expressed the opinion that he wasn't fit to come home.  \r\nAgain he was given no antibiotics on discharge despite obviously still suffering from pneumonia. He was provided with a carer package this time but the day after he was discharged the carer arrived an hour and a half too early and he fell on his way to the door to let them in.  \r\nHe ended up back in a& e less than 24hrs after his second discharge where, when I tried to ask a doctor how we could ensure he received the proper care this time, I was faced with condescension and plain rudeness. At a difficult time with an extremely poorly father this was the final straw and was so unprofessional it was unbelievable.  \r\nThroughout the whole process I have felt undervalued, not listened to or taken seriously. Despite knowing the most about my father and willingly offering this information drs seemed to have made up their minds that he had dementia and did not take his physical wellbeing into enough consideration. I felt the care he received was negligent and have caused untold pain and suffering.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-03-07T23:29:45.0066667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-03-10T14:18:41.96","readBy":[{"name":"Barts Health NHS Trust","count":2},{"name":"Plymouth University Urgent and Emergency Care Bsc (2020)","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/747645","id":"747645"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/747645/responses","id":"747645"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/747645/healthservices","id":"747645"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/747645/tags","id":"747645"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/r1h12_180","id":"R1H12_180","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/r1h12_300","id":"R1H12_300","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disappointed","id":"disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20listened%20to","id":"not listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/antibiotics","id":"antibiotics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/chest","id":"chest"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/chest%20infection","id":"chest infection"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cough","id":"cough"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dementia","id":"dementia"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/discharged","id":"discharged"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctors%20approach","id":"doctors approach"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fell","id":"fell"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/follow%20up%20care","id":"Follow up care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medication","id":"medication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20taken%20seriously","id":"not taken seriously"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pneumonia","id":"pneumonia"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/poor%20mobility","id":"poor mobility"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/748208","id":"748208"}]},{"id":748052,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Inadequate booking system","body":"i totally agree with other comments made.

I have a family history of Rheumatoid Arthritis and associated auto immune diseases so felt I better get it checked out.  \r\nMy GP ran blood tests, one of which suggested an issue with the Lupus antibody. I was therefore referred to the Rheumatology Clinic in Stonehouse Hospital mid February 2020. I also have a history of depression and low mood and chronic pain following a spinal injury. I have been under the care of Psychiatry, the Community Mental Health Team and a CPN for a few years.  \r\nI arrived for the Rheumatology appointment and was greeted by a member of staff who stated, I understand that you are under the care of the Community Mental Health Team and Psychiatry.  \r\nI felt absolutely humiliated!  \r\nThe disclosure on the letter of referral about my mental health history had absolutely no relevance to what I was attending for yet it absolutely dictated how I was treated. The felt I had been labelled before I even sat down. The staff member discharged me from the clinic and as I was leaving they told me I could pick up leaflets on Fibromyalgia and Raynaulds Syndrome on my way out.  \r\nI understand about full disclosure and the importance of providing accurate patient history in a letter of referral, but by putting my mental health history front and centre of this letter it completely prejudiced the way I was treated. I have now asked for a second opinion and am awaiting a response.  \r\nThe experience left me feeling humiliated and betrayed. Yes, I am the first one to admit I suffer from depression, but when I present with physical symptoms and a family history I expect to be treated on an even playing field. I had hoped that discrimination of this type was a thing of the past in the 21st century, sadly not!","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-03-08T17:57:39.75","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-03-10T15:13:18.937","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Education for Scotland","count":1},{"name":"NHS Lanarkshire","count":6},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2022)","count":2},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":1},{"name":"Scottish Recovery Network","count":1},{"name":"Yorkshire & Humber Patient Safety Research Collaboration","count":1},{"name":"South Lanarkshire Health and Social Care Forum","count":1},{"name":"Lanarkshire Links","count":1},{"name":"Scottish Government","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/747679","id":"747679"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/747679/responses","id":"747679"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/747679/healthservices","id":"747679"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/747679/tags","id":"747679"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l304h_410","id":"L304H_410","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/betrayed","id":"betrayed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/arthritis","id":"arthritis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/auto%20immune","id":"auto immune"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood","id":"blood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20tests","id":"blood tests"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/chronic%20pain","id":"chronic pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/consultant","id":"consultant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/depression","id":"depression"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/feeling","id":"feeling"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fibromyalgia","id":"fibromyalgia"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/injury","id":"injury"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/joint","id":"joint"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/joint%20pain","id":"joint pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/lupus","id":"lupus"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mobility","id":"mobility"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/rheumatoid","id":"rheumatoid"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/rheumatoid%20arthritis","id":"Rheumatoid arthritis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/second%20opinion","id":"second opinion"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/spinal","id":"spinal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/humiliated","id":"humiliated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/referral%20information","id":"referral information"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/labelled","id":"labelled"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/748092","id":"748092"}]},{"id":748061,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Its a funny old place but useless staff","body":"Another time recently I went to collect a missing prescription.

Glynis, Stephen and Jeannie are amazing people, who do a fantastic job. I credit them with helping me come back from a horrific low period!  \r\nAfter a period of support and treatment I was put forward for SCM.  \r\nSCM has been an amazing experience so far. Emma, Stephen and Kath have been great, creating a relaxed, supportive, educational environment to help learn these skills to self manage this tricky diagnosis. They each have a different teaching style and bring different perspectives, which really helps when you find the modules as challenging as I do. No question is too daft, no subject is off limits, there is no judgment. Group is a safe space.Emma as a cpn has been great, helping me decipher my emotions, encouraging me to PROBLEM SOLVE and is good at getting me to manage myself, but is still there if I need support. I initially felt a bit abandoned after the intense support of my previous cpn after a family member died, but I feel Emma is helping me (as is group) to take command of my EUPD and learn to manage it myself, rather than hiding or becoming its victim. Although she has not been tested (by my pet who met all the other cpns) I can tell she’s AWESOME.  \r\nStephen and Kath are also fab, they’re great at helping untangle the woolly mass of randomness that is my brain with EUPD, and all together I can’t imagine any team more perfect to teach this group.  \r\nBut enough about those amazing people, don’t want their heads to get too big lol!  \r\nGroup is great. I’ve met so many people and we’ve become friends. It’s fab not feeling so isolated and alone.  \r\nThe material is explained well, although I do take issue with the handouts. There’s so much paperwork. I think it could be streamlined so that instead of getting sheets each week, and then duplicates when we recover the subjects, maybe creating a workbook would help cut down on all that?  \r\nThe room we meet in is pretty crap. The facilitators make the best of it, but other people barge in, or barge past noisily. There was building work going on, so lots of noise and people clomping past on scaffolding. The tables are moved, removed, our board goes missing, at one point we didn’t have a room as they had double booked us and given the room to someone else.... in normal circumstances this is annoying but when you’re dealing with sensitive issues it becomes a huge issue. It impacts on the safe space of the group and is a big distraction.  \r\nThe group focusing on self management rather than being a support group is great. It means the environment is much more positive, and it actually makes me hopeful for my future. I like the little mindfulness minute thing we do at the beginning as it opens up your mind to other coping strategies that you might not usually consider.  \r\nSo in short SGM and the CMHT are fab, and worth their weight in gold.  \r\nThe one thing I do miss and struggle with is my art.

(Still losing a bit of weight wont hurt) first cell clean floor, grey walls, very noisy plumbing, no tv or pictures to stare at, noisy giggling staff out side room, my room has access door to a continually used store room housing what looks like rubbish bins, no windows. Just one very dim spotlight. Later Moved to second cell along with all test equipment, \noxygen bottle, my clothes holder and drip laying on my chest. all squeezed on bed thats too small for me (I'm 5ft 10ins) dumped in second cell & left, over hour & half maybe two before nurse arrived & asked what's wrong with me as no hand over done, ( still at least bits removed from bed, great a bit more room, & drip of ? Hung up). Second cell has no tv just hanging cables for show as tv broke so was removed I'm told, a very wonky sign on toilet door, toilet used as a cupboard stacked with chairs in shower area, windows that are broken & cant be closed, ask a couple of times for extra blankets but so far (a day later) still not arrived  luckily I had a fleece jacket & dressing gown to cover me..I was asked if I wanted tea it arrived but dumped far out of reach along with jug of water. Friend told to take my daily prescribed dosset box meds & morphine bottle home as they cant use them (health & safety excuse used) then later when given same medication by nurse one tablet was missing I asked why & was told we haven't got it in stock, we had to order some. Opps\nLive- just had nurse in 2nd time to test my blood sugar levels good news reads same as first test, she asked if I was diabetic? No I'm not was my reply, oh she said well your notes say you are. This has made me decide I think it might be best to leg it.\nBut as its too early to call friends to help me escape so I'll have hang on still it'll be nice to see how this comedy of errors plays out. All this written while laying on my cold cell and small worn out hospital bed. Hey Ho :/.  Still staff are friendly and chatty.

And, we were in SCBU for 6 weeks. During this time, I had help from an Infant Feeding Support Worker (Cathy) with Breastfeeding. I wanted to say how invaluable that was. Breastfeeding is an aspect that is very important and was something I was determined to be able to do. Having Cathy there was extremely helpful, and supportive. Although all the nurses in SCBU are fantastic, and can be asked anything, they have so much else to do/keep an eye on, that they simply don't always have the time to spend with you to help for an entire Breastfeed. It's something that requires time and patience, so having Cathy there to spend that important time was, as I say, invaluable.  \r\nNot only did she have the time, but as this was her main role, I felt comforted knowing how experienced she was in this aspect. She came across as highly experienced, which was reassuring. It was helpful having a main person to discuss it with rather than input and advice from multiple different people/sources.  \r\nHaving a premature baby is stressful enough and without having the hands on help and support, I'm not sure how well I would have got on attempting the feeding alone.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-03-09T03:50:36.18","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-03-10T16:13:17.053","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Highland","count":2},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/747724","id":"747724"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/747724/responses","id":"747724"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/747724/healthservices","id":"747724"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/747724/tags","id":"747724"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/h202h_501","id":"H202H_501","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/advice","id":"advice"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/comforted","id":"comforted"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/premature%20baby","id":"premature baby"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support%20with%20feeding","id":"support with feeding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support%20worker","id":"support worker"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/patience","id":"patience"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassured","id":"reassured"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassuring","id":"reassuring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported","id":"supported"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/748441","id":"748441"}]},{"id":748075,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Professional and kind","body":"Treated with dignity and respect by the healthcare practitioners and HCA's.

Both nurses spoke to me with kindness and i felt very comfortable in their care.\nMy only slight issue was while waiting i was in quite a bit of pain, so i went to the receptionist to ask if it was possible to get any paracetamol, and she directed me to the nurses desk, but unfortunately it wasn't manned. However i understand that this request was outside of the receptionists remit and the poor triage nurses looked like they were run ragged, so i wasn't unhappy with this! Also i was seen pretty quickly after that so it wasn't a problem at all. Your staff do a great job with the pressures they are put under, and were really caring towards me and my relatively minor injury - your staff are a credit to your department.

Firstly after weeks and weeks of waiting I chased up the referral only to be told firstly it was on a waiting list, followed several weeks later by it wasn't there. This took approximately 10 phonecalls to 10 different people to establish. One of them even hung up on me! This was only resolved when my own GP got involved. After that the appointment came through quite quick. Me and my husband took a day off work to attend. We left home early in the morning and sat in traffic for two hours to get there. Only for the appointment to last 5 minutes!! I didnt see the expected specialist I saw his registrar, fair enough. Only he had no notes and didn't know why I was there. He then didn't have a copy of my MRI scan which took place several months before. He told me there was nothing he could do without looking at this and would obtain it and call me the next day. This was weeks ago and i have received no such call. I have a Condition that is intensified by stress. The whole situation of chasing the appointment caused a flair up so I have not bothered chasing them again to date.
