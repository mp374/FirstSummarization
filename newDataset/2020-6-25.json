We tried paracetamol, but with no relief. He then was sick a couple of times. Over the morning we were unsure what this was but when he told me his vision was blurred I called 111. Their advice was to go to A &E within the hour, which shocked us. However, we took their advice and went just after 12 noon. Despite a busy A & E we were seen promptly by the Triage Nurse and my husband referred for a brain scan within 20mins. By this time we were getting worried as his sight was reducing in one eye and he couldn't see the clock face numbers anymore.  \r\nAs soon as the scan result excluded a brain abnormality he was sent to the Eye Department. Even though it was a Sunday afternoon we were met by such professionalism and kindness by this team of 2 - a Registered Nurse and Ophthalmology Consultant (SB and Miss T)- that we were almost overwhelmed by their care.  \r\nAlmost immediately an iv injection was given to reduce the pressure in the affected eye and then drops. Both staff were at the end of a long day shift at the weekend but gave us the impression our care was important to them. By the time we left my husbands eyesight was restored and the follow up treatment was organised and carried out the next day by laser.

During our sessions, Steven was sympathetic, kind and extremely understanding, which was absolutely vital to my mental recovery.  \r\nI used the service for 3 months, and although it was brief, this was everything l needed to get me back to being me again.  \r\nI am so grateful to my GP and Steven and l would highly recommend the service to anyone.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-06-24T10:01:23.2866667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-06-25T09:48:28.88","readBy":[{"name":"Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust","count":5}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/773647","id":"773647"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/773647/responses","id":"773647"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/773647/healthservices","id":"773647"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/773647/tags","id":"773647"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rha-iapt-city","id":"rha-iapt-city","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kind","id":"kind"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sympathetic","id":"sympathetic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/talking%20therapy","id":"talking therapy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/therapist","id":"therapist"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/timely","id":"timely"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/understanding","id":"understanding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported","id":"supported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/clear%20information","id":"clear information"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/773855","id":"773855"}]},{"id":773556,"author":"Chribanna","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"So impressed with staff","body":"I was really nervous about having a colposcopy following an abnormal smear test.

Like many of us we have been left without pain relief during this pandemic and life has been intolerable. No communication regarding when clinics will resume, no communication from the consultant. My GP requested input from my Consultant.  \r\nDays later nothing had arrived for my GP, I called and spoke a Secretary. I received a very rude and very inappropriate attitude. Their response seemed aggressive and extremely short tempered. Problems with the same secretary in the past but even though I have mentioned this to others nothing appears to have changed regarding their attitude and the way they speak to me as a patient. I had my phone on speaker phone as I am unable to hold the phone with my daughter so that we could trace what was actually happening to the doctor's recommendations expected days ago. I was told it went in the post! ! it wasn't faxed or emailed. Total lack of understanding.  \r\nThis should have been emailed or faxed so that my GP received it asap....not days later with the post especially being slower then normal during this crisis we are all enduring. This member of staff acted rude, aggressive, totally flippant and their attitude was totally appalling. Fortunately for me this time I had a witness to the conversation. It has been normal to always blame me when I have tried to make a complaint because of my mental health problems as well as neurological problems. During the last few months I have been left to just get on with it like most of us, in pain, not functioning and life is grime. This recent attitude towards me and my GP has caused upset, alarm and a complete lack of respect to the NHS profession as well as to me personally.

After undergoing some tests at my GPS and local hospital I was referred to a Senior Hearing Therapist at the Royal Cornwall Hospitals NHS Trust.  \r\nMy initial appointment was comprehensive and it was clear from the outset that Liz my therapist was an extremely skilled practitioner who considered my tinnitus in a holistic manner, considering my wider well being in addition to hearing-related issues.  \r\nI left the appointment with a great deal of homework! Some very useful reading material; instructions to use a special app each night for a prolonged period of time and suggestions to incorporate additional mindfulness and stress-reducing activity into my life.  \r\nShortly before my follow up appointment lockdown began however I followed the advice and was very pleasantly surprised to be offered a remote follow-up in mid June, something I had assumed would not be happening due to the Covid-19 situation.  \r\nThis follow-up appointment enabled me to reflect on the progress I had made with my tinnitus and I realised that by following the advice given by Liz my tinnitus has massively reduced over the last few months and I have now virtually no negative impact on my life as a result of the condition.  \r\nLiz once again used a very holistic approach and I felt valued and supported as a patient. I am incredibly grateful for her support and considerable expertise and feel very lucky to have been provided with access to such a high quality service.

He said to tell them I had been referred there by him for my poorly eye. It’s worth mentioning that I am shielding from Covid since March - now (June). This is the first time I’ve left the house.  \r\nI arrived and there was a queue outside - that’s fine most people are social distancing. Before I got inside I was told that by no means would my partner be allowed inside with me. My anxiety went from about a 5 to a 9. I got inside and I had to wait in the boxes on the box, completely sensible and made me feel safe. They had red tape on the floor asking you not to get close to the counter For the safety of the staff. Except, we both had masks on and I absolutely could not hear the receptionist at all so I have to go to the counter. It was virtually impossible to hear them but we managed it.  \r\nI sat down and waited to be triaged by the nurse. I was called over to the counter. Now this was even more tricky than the reception desk because I can’t hear the triage nurse at all and they are asking me much more complex questions. The nurse asked if I had been referred to the centre I said yes by the optician. The nurse replied in a what I felt was a rude manner and asked where my letter was then.  \r\nI explained I didn’t have one I just spoke to my optician on the phone. The nurse informed me if I didn't have a referral letter I could not be referred!  \r\nSelf referral it is then. I was a bit upset like I might be wasting people time but I had been told to come by the optician. I was then asked why I was here today. I said “well I spoke to the optician and he said....” the same nurse replied that they didn't CARE what the optician had said, they want to know why I was here today. I got quite upset at this point so I started to tell my story to this member of staff and again I felt they got cross and told me to just get to the point as why I am here now. At the end of the conversation they told me to go sit on the chairs. I had to ask for this to be repeated 3 times because I couldn’t hear. I was then shouted at at by this staff member.  \r\nI was ready to walk out and leave at this point.  \r\nThankfully. The next nurse for my vision today was WONDERFUL. They were so kind and listened to me and made me feel important. After I saw them they took me round to see the doctor.  \r\nI was in the waiting area to see the doctor and honestly I saw some questionable things... masks because worn not covering the nose by staff. Groups of staff in offices not social distancing. Cardigans being worn by nurses. Doctors walking around with gloves on touching doors and not changing their gloves. I clearly senior nurse belittled a health care assistant at once point, in a corridor, because they needed to use the bathroom. It was a bit of a sorry sight.  \r\nI eventually got in to see the doctor and as I suspected I needed to have surgery. The then consultant came into the room to tell the doctor that they was not working quick enough and had a backlog of patients. Honestly I was really upset by this, the consultant did apologise for coming in but we were in the middle of the consultation and they interrupted us planning my care.  \r\nBy this point I burst into tears in the office. They haven’t performed the surgery I need in 4 months and they have no plans to reopen it. I am in so much pain and discomfort in my eye I said I can’t keep going on like this. The doctor was really kind, & I wasn't rushed out of the office despite the telling off they had just received from the boss. This doctor has given me some medicine to try and make my eye bearable for the time being.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-06-23T20:23:02.6566667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-06-25T15:56:52.083","readBy":[{"name":"Sandwell and West Birmingham Hospitals NHS Trust","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/773585","id":"773585"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/773585/responses","id":"773585"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/773585/healthservices","id":"773585"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/773585/tags","id":"773585"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rxk03","id":"RXK03","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxious","id":"anxious"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20being%20listened%20to","id":"not being listened to"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20upset","id":"very upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/consultant%20attitude","id":"Consultant Attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctor","id":"doctor"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/eye","id":"eye"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurse","id":"nurse"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/safe","id":"safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sight","id":"sight"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/some%20staff","id":"some staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/triage%20nurse","id":"triage nurse"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vision","id":"vision"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ppe","id":"ppe"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/786419","id":"786419"}]},{"id":773662,"author":"Longell","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Care by the a & e dept","body":"I had a flair up of excruciating pain caused by inflammatory arthritis.

When I try to assert some control over my treatment pathway I am met with resistance. Little attention is given to the daily pain I am left to endure, it seems as if this is not considered worth addressing. An example of this is the refusal to provide any pain relief even after eye surgery, for which recovery is unimaginably painful.  \r\nMedical staff have been repeatedly dismissive and unable to show empathy to me when I am in severe pain and distress. Waiting times between appointments are ludicrous, to the point where I have had many more emergency appointments with whoever is available than my actual treatment team. The only positive aspect of this clinic is the nursing staff, who are very caring and attentive, but they have limited ability to help.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-06-24T21:09:58.0166667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-06-25T16:35:30.66","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Grampian","count":4},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/773772","id":"773772"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/773772/responses","id":"773772"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/773772/healthservices","id":"773772"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/773772/tags","id":"773772"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/n101h_130","id":"N101H_130","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/access%20to%20pain%20relief","id":"access to pain relief"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/attentive","id":"attentive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/caring","id":"caring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/empathy","id":"empathy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nursing%20staff","id":"nursing staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting%20times","id":"waiting times"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/involved%20in%20decisions","id":"involved in decisions"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/774024","id":"774024"}]},{"id":773897,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Fabulous practice","body":"The doctors and nurses and the reception staff are extremely helpful.

Personally I can only praise the attention and care I received and cannot fault anything.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-06-25T11:17:43","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-06-25T17:01:06","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/773901","id":"773901"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/773901/responses","id":"773901"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/773901/healthservices","id":"773901"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/773901/tags","id":"773901"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rc971","id":"RC971","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/arm","id":"arm"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/back","id":"back"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bone","id":"bone"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/broken","id":"broken"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/head","id":"head"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/operation","id":"operation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/plaster","id":"plaster"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wound","id":"wound"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/x-ray","id":"X-ray"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/790306","id":"790306"}]},{"id":773841,"author":"Larst55","authorRoleId":7,"authorRole":"a staff member posting for a carer/relative","title":"Therapy Team input","body":"Andrea who visited was very good, the equipment provided has been very helpful and has helped my relative with 'day to day' living, Andrea rang me twice and checked everything was okay and the red cross delivery driver was also extremely helpful.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-06-25T09:28:07.6066667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-06-25T17:05:11.237","readBy":[{"name":"Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust","count":6}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/773841","id":"773841"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/773841/responses","id":"773841"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/773841/healthservices","id":"773841"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/773841/tags","id":"773841"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rha20-29302","id":"rha20-29302","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/equipment","id":"equipment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helpful","id":"helpful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/family%20kept%20informed","id":"family kept informed"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/774036","id":"774036"}]},{"id":773876,"author":"Helch33","authorRoleId":8,"authorRole":"a staff member posting for a patient/service user","title":"Requiring a piece of equipment to support with transfers","body":"My wife needed a piece of equipment to help with safer transfers and the Therapy Team were efficient in arranging this for me which has made the task much easier. &nbsp;

As far as I am concerned I was with them because of suffering with quite serious mental health problems for many years in my life. My description of these problems would be depression, anxiety and PTSD. However a long time ago when I was 13 years old I was also diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome too, which is something that I have always had doubts about as it never seemed to sit right with me (or at least not in the way that people seemed to assume that I was affected by it). So when I was under these services they kept treating me as though this label was true and trying to push treatment on me for it which I could not accept or go along with as I felt that this would have been the wrong support for me as I was trying to get help for the mental health issues that I was experiencing. However they never seemed to really listen to me about this (even though they would pretend to) as they would just carry on acting in the same way and treating me in a way which if anything had more of a harmful effect on my mental wellbeing, and then in the end they just seemed to write me of as being a difficult personality and dropped me altogether because I would not agree with them, even though all I ever really wanted was to get the right sort of support to help me to recover more and always did my best to act well. I think that when you have a label such as this though and people are aware of it then they make judgements about you based upon that, and then also start assuming things about you that are not really real. So if you are suffering from anxiety and things whilst you are around them then they end up making judgments about you based only on the surface appearance of things, and then assume that you are really like that because you have some sort of learning disability or are mentally handicapped in some way where you do not understand things, and then they feel that they have to start acting in a strange way around you without really getting to know you properly first or understanding the true reasons why you are like that. It is as though they like to put everything into nice easy boxes for themselves and assume that they know better about things because they have some sort of title or qualification. Plus they would also listen to my parents a lot who called them up and sometimes even pass on information about me to them, even though I had tried explaining to them that my relationship with them had been bad for my mental wellbeing over the years due to the problems that they also have. In fact I am not even saying that I am not affected by this condition in some way or that I am not on that spectrum at all (as many people probably are). But all I know is that even if this label of aspergers syndrome was true in some way then it would still not be true in the same way that people have seemed to assume that I am affected by it and the assumptions that they have made based around that. Since I do think that there is quite a lot of stigma and discrimination out there to do with a person’s mental state or the way that their brain is working, and in my experiences the mental health services in Enfield are certainly no exception to this either even though they might like to hide behind a phoney image and pretend to be something different. So much so that it has even left me feeling quite bad for people who actually are affected by this condition or affected by it more acutely, because I know from my own treatment the amount of judgment and discrimination that they must have to endure. I was discharged from the mental health services a long time ago and since then I have developed a physical problem with my body due to the mental illness eventually taking its toll on me, which I have found to be difficult to live with. I have been trying to work through my mental health issues for a long time by myself after I realised that I was not going to get any help from the services and gave up on them, but my physical problem has also made them a lot worse (and perhaps may not have even developed it in the first place if the service had been better). So I reluctantly tried to get a referred back to the mental health services because I was struggling so much with things but every time they just ignored me and never got back in touch. Until I ended up calling the NHS helpline again on the last occasion that I tried and I was referred to the Crisis Team who arranged a meeting with me. I met a man and a woman at the meeting and I think that one of them was supposed to be a psychologist or something (although I wasn’t convinced) and I sat there for quite a long time explaining things to them and talking about previous experiences as well as things that I had been through in my life that I felt had caused me to have these types of problems, and they also asked me quite a few personal questions too including to do with incidents of sexual assault that I had happened to me whilst they wrote loads of stuff down on paper. But then after all of this they just seemed to completely ignore everything that I had said to them and one of them told me that they saw aspergers in my, despite the fact that they had only just met me and that they were also not qualified in that area as far as I am aware to make such a diagnosis. So it then became apparent to me that this was probably the idea that they had in mind before the meeting had even taken place and also the outcome that they had already planned and wanted to happen, and that the whole thing had really just been a bit of an act as they still had the same ideas about me that other people had from all those years ago. Even though it is apparently not even that uncommon for the effects of trauma to sometimes be mistaken as part of the autistic spectrum anyway, and I also had a scarf over my mouth because of the pandemic so they couldn’t even see my expressions properly. They did not give me the referral that I wanted but instead wanted me to go to another organisation that specialises with autism so that I can get reassessed, even though I explained to them that I was not in a position to do this right now because of the problems in my life as it could mean that I loose benefit money that I need to survive which would make my mental health even worse. They even told me that I would not get paid any money for having mental illness although I am not sure if they were speaking the truth or not as everything just seemed to be based around the assumption that I definitely did have this condition and that this would have been confirmed by having such a test. So I told them that they would do exactly the same thing as me if they were in the same position instead of putting themselves in danger which they disagreed with, even though they could not come up with any alternative solutions. Then after this meeting they closed the door on me and pretty much left me to die again, even after I had told them that I was getting closer to the edge and I ended up leaving that meeting feeling even worse than I did before. Plus I’m not even that sure why having a condition such as aspergers should affect you from getting help for your mental illnesses from that service, or why they would think that they know someone better than they know themselves. At this point though I am not even sure if I care that much anymore as I have lost my faith and trust in this service and I can understand why I have heard to many people complain about the Crisis Team and why there are so many bad reviews online about the Enfield Mental Health Service which still doesn’t seem to have changed much. They certainly don’t make it very easy for me to accept myself even if you do have a condition such as aspergers syndrome due to the amount of stigma that they have towards people and the assumptions that they make. In fact the last social worker that I had with them years ago would even talk with me about a lot of conspiracy theories or aliens and things because they seemed to have an idea that this was the sort of thing that I was into. Even though I think that it is quite obvious that this is not really a very good idea when you are working with vulnerable and mentally ill people who could be suffering from paranoia, and this is probably just one example of the absurd sort of stuff that goes on there.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-06-12T00:47:22.9766667","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2020-06-26T10:13:25.51","readBy":[{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2020)","count":2},{"name":"Barnet, Enfield and Haringey Mental Health NHS Trust","count":1},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2022)","count":2},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2021)","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/772107","id":"772107"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/772107/responses","id":"772107"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/772107/healthservices","id":"772107"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/772107/tags","id":"772107"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rrp_10001","id":"RRP_10001","score":1},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ignored","id":"ignored"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/should%20listen","id":"Should listen"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/aspergers%20syndrome","id":"Aspergers Syndrome"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/depression","id":"depression"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disability","id":"disability"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/judgemental","id":"judgemental"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/listen","id":"listen"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20illness","id":"mental illness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ptsd","id":"ptsd"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vulnerable","id":"vulnerable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/on%20edge","id":"on edge"}]},{"id":773982,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Kindness and Care ","body":"Wanted to find a way to thank the practice for your support this morning from my initial phone call to the receptionist, to my speedy call back from a doctor within 15 minutes, and a super efficient pharmacy team to complete the support needed.

The reason why I needed physiotherapy was due to the fact that my pelvic x-ray showed at least a issue, my hips were getting tight, plus I noticed a weird feature. It was my knees of course, because my right knee was noticed to be taller than my left knee, plus just before that, I was given a referral by my GP at Harptree, because given the fact was that I had tenderness in my joints and I wasn't even wearing my insoles. I had episodes of pain at my school in Weston-Super-Mare, the Uphill area, so this prompted me to be seen by my GP. Now, on the day of my first physiotherapy appointment, I was seen by a nice and kind physiotherapist. Given the fact that I'm permanently deaf, my type is sensory and profound deafness, I never found it hard and started having exercises and got my list of exercises and have not yet gotten any more exercise during lockdown, plus it was a great way to just stop having those pains, as I now have them rarely.

Two years ago I got diagnosed with Leukemia due to the continuing effect that PTSD had on my immune system over so many years. The GP surgery missed both PTSD and Cancer diagnosis.  \r\nI was taken to Croydon University Hospital where I was diagnosed fairly quickly, but the service I got for the 6 months was not very good. Yes I survived and I am thankfully in remission, but that was because of my determination more than anything. The chemo helped cure the cancer but the bad service didn't do my PTSD. Any favours.  \r\nI was advised by my GP to use Royal Marsden which I did but I was told by my oncologist at CUH that this was not ideal so I chose to stay at CUH. From problems in the administration down to the actual care I have stuck with them and nothing about the service has improved at all. I am now needing to find somewhere else to go as dealing with so many issues creates problems with my PTSD and really I am not asking for anything other than decent care and that is not happening.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-06-24T12:21:11.9366667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-06-26T11:21:30.84","readBy":[{"name":"Croydon Health Services NHS Trust","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/773660","id":"773660"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/773660/responses","id":"773660"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/773660/healthservices","id":"773660"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/773660/tags","id":"773660"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rj611_300","id":"RJ611_300","score":1},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stress","id":"stress"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/traumatic","id":"traumatic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/administration","id":"administration"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cancer","id":"cancer"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cancer%20care","id":"cancer care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/chemo","id":"chemo"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diagnosis","id":"diagnosis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health%20needs","id":"mental health needs"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/oncologist","id":"oncologist"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/post%20traumatic%20stress%20disorder","id":"post traumatic stress disorder"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ptsd","id":"ptsd"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/quick%20diagnosis","id":"quick diagnosis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassion","id":"compassion"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/service","id":"service"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/774486","id":"774486"}]},{"id":773670,"author":"robinwe69","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Good experience with Lanarkshire Dietitians","body":"Yesterday I experienced an online video consultation with one of Lanarkshire’s Dietitian’s.
