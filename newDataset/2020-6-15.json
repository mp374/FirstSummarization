[{"id":770922,"author":"velact93","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Mental Health support in Boston","body":"Poor Mental Health Service.  \r\nOr... \"Basically if you have a mental health issue, go private or get help from a charity if you can.\"  \r\nI am writing both about my individual experience as a mental health patient and the treatment I witnessed of other patients.  \r\nAs a disclaimer overall I agree with affordable health care in principle and I am grateful for the support of people in the NHS. I going to rant in this post because it needs to be said I hope that it wakes some executive up at the Pilgrim, a politician perhaps or someone who has the ability to change the system.  \r\nMental Health Support in Boston, Lincolnshire from the Pilgrim and the area in general even just pre-pandemic ranges in my experience from detrimental to nothing.  \r\nI have been let down by the Lincolnshire Trust, the bureaucracy and being passed on from service to service. Even whilst in distress I have tried to be civil, reasonable, treat the professionals with respect and be articulate. Reading between the lines it just seems like as a patient, care for my mental health is not a priority. I have issues with how mental health services in Lincolnshire are ran.  \r\nWriting this I am probable going to get a standard response about contacting PALS that a Twitter bot could have written. I am tired, I am angry and I wanted help the NHS mental health services failed me. I was shocked at the level of prejudice, discrimination seen towards other patients and staff.  \r\nMedical records lost, information with held, promises of family support non existent. The Crisis Team in Boston is not fit for purpose. I know that as a fact many patients in the Boston area are told to telephone the crisis team (CRHT) or get help from the CMHT but those patients do not use the service because we feel it is not fit for purpose.  \r\nIt is as if you have to say certain magic words to get the help you need perhaps this is because there is a massive difference in what there is in reality and the NICE guidelines suggest.  \r\nGetting supportive treatment is difficult to impossible for people who are classed as high functioning and patients seem to be off rolled. The figures, statistics and the ratings matter but they are not a good indicator of how the service is. It feels like the patient does not come first. Lincolnshire has a single point of access but I was basically just fobbed off bounced back from CBT to CMHT.  \r\nCBT is massively promoted, it has long waiting times and the treatment times are short plus with large class sizes the quality is poor. As I did not respond well to CBT, I was off rolled back to your GP after one to two weeks. CBT is provided by steps to change and they off rolled me of the course, I am not allowed to access any help because I am not allowed to compete steps to changes basic course.  \r\nGetting access to Mental Health care in Lincolnshire has been difficult if not impossible and the system doesn't make any sense. I have been told to talk about mental health and get some support but when I do I get told to effectively shut up.  \r\nI know that I suffer with depression, I suffer with anxiety, PTSD, I have been stabbed, burned, raped, been threatened with firearms, I have lost count of the amount of times people have attempted to murder me, I have been homeless, I have seen people suffer and die. I have tried to keep going and live a good life. I have tried to get an education, I have worked when I can, I have earned qualification, I have volunteered but I needed some at certain from the NHS but it just was not there.  \r\nPeople tell me you can talk about mental health but that is a lie, you have to keep it a secret because you will probably lose your job and people will not consider you for opportunities.  \r\nMental Health support in Boston, at Pilgrim the reality is there has been none for me. I battle every day to be kind and not hurt those who have hurt me but I think about revenge everyday. I know this is because my mental health is poor but I do not talk about it openly anymore with mental health professionals everyday I have to make a choice not to seek revenge.  \r\nI know the PHQ-9 test by memory. I hide my scars, hide the shaking from the PTSD, the vomit from the anxiety (I always have a toothbrush on me), I live alone no one sees me scream at night, I use ice packs for the pain, I use a gun shield at night for when the flashbacks happen. I am in agony, I want some relief and I would not say I have given up with the NHS but I would say that I have accepted that there is no help for me on the NHS but there is a lot of rubbish that says there is help but again the reality is there is nothing.  \r\nI have seen patients be told if you want help you will have to have a proper suicide attempt. To use an analogy I feel like I am treated like Frankenstein's creature or the Gollum of Folklore, you had your use, your not wanted but worse your a mental health monster.  \r\nIf you want to improve the NHS mental services set up some real practical help and support services. Stop cutting effective services and passing them off as improvements. The NHS should cut down on false promises and the marketing hype. How can we as patients be expected to integrate into society if realistically there is no support?  \r\nMaybe this comment will be removed but I have been silent for long enough and I want to exercise my freedom of speech. Perhaps reading this things might change but honestly I do not think they ever will.  \r\nI have no trust in the CRHT, the CMHT and mental health services. If someone who has a friend or family member who is suffering I would suggest private care and support if possible or even support from a charity. Mental Health is a broken system sold as everything is fine like a dead parrot sketch. As for the loving acronyms there is one I would use to describe the service as B.S but that does not mean Brilliant Service (use your imagination). I have come to the conclusion that there is no help for someone like me. I genuinely hope that sometime in the next few years I go to sleep unaware and die. When I needed support there was none, I am in agony and I just want it to end.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-06-02T18:05:08.8033333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-06-15T09:20:00.487","readBy":[{"name":"Lincolnshire Partnership NHS Foundation Trust","count":2},{"name":"Kings medical students, 2020","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/770922","id":"770922"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/770922/responses","id":"770922"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/770922/healthservices","id":"770922"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/770922/tags","id":"770922"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rp7_710","id":"RP7_710","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/angry","id":"angry"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/crisis","id":"crisis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/shocked","id":"shocked"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/access%20to%20mental%20health%20services","id":"access to mental health services"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/alone","id":"alone"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cbt","id":"cbt"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/depression","id":"depression"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/die","id":"die"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/homeless","id":"homeless"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/missing%20records","id":"missing records"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pals.","id":"PALS."},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ptsd","id":"ptsd"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/service%20cuts","id":"service cuts"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/speech","id":"speech"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/suicide","id":"suicide"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support%20for%20family","id":"support for family"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/no%20hope","id":"no hope"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/772444","id":"772444"}]},{"id":771094,"author":"ian 29","authorRoleId":3,"authorRole":"a parent/guardian","title":"My son is in neuro","body":"I feel that as a family how can the hospital say we can't contact him only well 1 person but in this case 2.

The experience was fine for the most part and the staff were great in the lead up to the surgery and the morning before the surgery.  \r\nAfter the surgery I needed assistance to go to the bathroom due to both arms being operated on and unfortunately I did not have a good experience with this. The first time I needed the toilet after surgery I was left on a commode for about 20 minutes without any way of getting assistance without shouting. Again in the morning I was left needing the bathroom for over 2 hours. I asked 2 nurses each, about half an hour apart, who said they would come back to me once they had finished their quick task. When neither of them returned I pushed my assistance button and asked a third staff member who said they would go and get the nurses. I ended up pacing near my bed and had resigned myself to just go stand over the toilet so that I didn't end up wetting myself on the floor. Eventually the cleaner saw me distressed and managed to go and get one of the morning staff to come and help me. The night staff at no point apologised and just walked past me later to go home.  \r\nThis was a particularly embarrassing situation for me made worse by how it was handled. I am a young woman and being put in the position where I had asked for help multiple times and was left feeling like I was going to have to be incontinent was very upsetting. I work in a hospital and I understand that people are busy however I do not feel that this was ok.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-06-12T09:07:08.61","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-06-15T09:20:03.927","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lothian","count":5},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/772150","id":"772150"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/772150/responses","id":"772150"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/772150/healthservices","id":"772150"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/772150/tags","id":"772150"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/s314h_100","id":"S314H_100","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/arms","id":"arms"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/distressed","id":"distressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/access%20to%20toilets","id":"access to toilets"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/response%20to%20buzzer","id":"response to buzzer"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/772397","id":"772397"}]},{"id":772188,"author":"maxal","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Great phlebotomy service","body":"Had a lovely visit from a nurse named Kim who works for North Lanarkshire Health board phlebotomy service.

To top it all, examination took about 60 seconds, told me the breast tissue was normal and the same on both sides, despite there being a defined lump on one breast that is NOT on the other. No test, no ultrasound, no explanation of what the lump, which appeared out of the blue three weeks ago, was. Don't think they even found it.

The receptionist & most of the other staff were very polite, courteous & helpful. Having had my initial assessment I waited for a doctor to see me. Eventually a doctor came called my name & look me from the reception area to a cubical. On entering the cubical there was a used blue gown which was picked up & then thrown back on the chair. I was then asked to sit on a computer chair & asked what the problem was. At no time did they make any attempt to sanitise their hands after having touched the used gown. I was asked some questions, & told I should have an X-ray. While doing this, another member of staff informed the doctor that I should not have been taken into this cubical & it was designated for usage. The body gesture & attitude in reply was very negative in that they did not verbally acknowledge the staff member, ignoring them and pointing me towards another cubical.Later having had the X-ray, the receptionist called me forward telling me that I had to attend the fracture clinic later that day. The receptionist asked if I had received my medication & had the doctor seen me to which I replied “No”. So the receptionist kindly went to locate the doctor to get the information that the doctor should have done. During my stay there was 19 individuals that were registered with the initial waiting time of 35 minutes. When I saw the doctor the numbers had increased up to 33, with the waiting time increased to just over an hour. Never the less, I feel that the Doctor hadn’t cause to act disrespectful towards other staff members.

She then explained the website should have a purple logo on top and she read out completely different sections. So then she said.... you must be on the other website?  I replied..... i only knew of one which is patient access.... so i said i would go and look at this other site, also i explained I'm not technical. Then said Goodbye!\nWhen she put phone down it was not completely down and i heard the member of staff rudely discussing me saying how can you find a website so hard to find?, it was clear she was a bit peeved from our telephone conversation there was a few other things she said but it was muffled because i could hear the other member of staff laughing with her⁸.

The doctor numerously cut me off mid-sentence every time I tried to explain my situation and circumstances, failing to listen to my reasoning, and jumping to his own conclusions, leading to a rash decision to harshly terminate my use of Dexamfetamine. I explained the benefits and improvements in which the medication had provided, but he disregarded that.\nThe clinic has not telephoned me to check up on my wellbeing, since forcing me the medication in October 2019, contrary to making it very clear to the clinic and my GP on many occasions that I have been struggling with ADHD symptoms for the past eight months.\nAfter reading their Care Plan report, I was shocked by the fact that the nurse had provided false information. Additionally, taking my words out of context. Due to my frustration, which led to depression, as a result of a lack of productivity, due to the absence of ADHD medication, I was left with no choice but to file a complain against Maudsley Hospital’s ADHD clinic on 21 January 2020.\nI received a response from the Complaint’s department on 10 March 2020, stating the adverse effects of the medication I was taking was ‘severe’. This was completely false, as on the contrary, I provided several facts to the doctor, describing the benefits of being the medication; not only improvements in my productivity, but positive life changes due to a good mental wellbeing, and enhanced motivation.\nFurther to appealing the complain in March 2020, I have yet to receive a response from the sender of the letter. \nAfter liaising with my GP, the doctor wrote another referral letter to the clinic, explaining how my ADHD symptoms had worsened over the course of eight months without medication, affecting my personal life and professional aspirations. \n\nI received a telephone call from the nurse, a couple of weeks ago, who stated that the doctor was absent from his duties at the clinic.\nIt is to my knowledge that NHS doctors are working virtually.

The signage at the new suit is very misleading, and there was no one on reception at the new unit.","criticality":"minimally critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-06-15T09:34:01.0866667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-06-15T13:26:56.67","readBy":[{"name":"Healthwatch Isle of Wight","count":2},{"name":"Isle of Wight NHS Trust","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/772392","id":"772392"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/772392/responses","id":"772392"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/772392/healthservices","id":"772392"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/772392/tags","id":"772392"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/r1f01","id":"R1F01","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/eye","id":"eye"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/great%20service","id":"great service"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/injection","id":"injection"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/signage","id":"signage"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fantastic","id":"fantastic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/773771","id":"773771"}]},{"id":772432,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"great practice","body":"The doctor is brilliant doctor.Everytime he has provide excellent service and always always look after his patients well being in depth","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-06-15T12:58:54","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2020-06-15T13:28:13","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/772432","id":"772432"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/772432/responses","id":"772432"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/772432/healthservices","id":"772432"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/772432/tags","id":"772432"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/e84058","id":"E84058","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/brilliant","id":"brilliant"}]},{"id":772431,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Poor Administration","body":"Told to telephoned for an appointment at 8.30 am , line engaged for 20 minutes -then all appointments booked.

I was directed towards the primary care unit and told to call 111 again and see if the doctor attending could fit me in as I needed assessment and anti viral medication for shingles.  I was told to sit in the waiting area in the phlebotomy/primary care area by a staff member. When the doctor called me in, they told me I should not be there and should not have been in the waiting area in case someone pregnant was there.  Shingles is only contagious for chicken pox during the blister phase and I barely had skin redness in my armpit (the area of which was completely covered by my clothes). I was made to feel guilty about not having a clinician’s level of understanding regarding the risk I ‘might’ pose and only did as I was told by medical staff.  I was made to feel like I could have made someone else ill and was wasting the doctor’s time, despite following the instructions I was given by health professionals and effective treatment being time dependant from the onset of symptoms.  I was feeling very unwell and I would not want anyone else to be made to feel the same way I did with the ‘care’ I received.

Manchester Eye Hospital with an appointment for this afternoon. This followed a previous appointment, where the scan taken was blurred. He was expecting a look inside his eye, probably followed by laser treatment to clear his vision.  \r\nI agreed to drive him there, (dad sitting in the far corner of the back seat) although we do not live in the same household, because I did not want someone in their 80’s to use public transport, which is how he usually goes to appointments.  \r\nDad arrived for his appointment and was told that the appointment was cancelled yesterday. He had not received either a phone call or text message telling him this.  \r\nAlthough his records were not available, the staff looked on the computer, and repeated the tests carried out previously. They explained briefly how the laser works, as my dad is nervous about treatments. However, they confirmed that the laser was not operational at the moment.  \r\nQuestions:  \r\n1. Why was the appointment, only made a week ago, cancelled, and why was my dad not told? Was it because the laser wasn’t working, or something else?  \r\n2. With the current COVID-19 situation, why was my dad put at risk? Travel, passing other people in the hospital, seeing staff unnecessarily.  \r\nI am extremely unhappy that an elderly vulnerable adult was put in this situation.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-06-13T15:22:03.2533333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-06-16T09:13:55.937","readBy":[{"name":"Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust","count":1},{"name":"Healthwatch Tameside","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/772332","id":"772332"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/772332/responses","id":"772332"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/772332/healthservices","id":"772332"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/772332/tags","id":"772332"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/r0a04_130","id":"R0A04_130","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cancellation","id":"cancellation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/eye","id":"eye"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scan","id":"scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tests","id":"tests"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unhappy","id":"unhappy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vision","id":"vision"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/social%20distancing","id":"social distancing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20at%20risk","id":"put at risk"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/776230","id":"776230"}]},{"id":772510,"author":"Glad867","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Some recommendations","body":"After a successful 4 years at Wathwood I would like to thank the responsible authorities and make these recommendations:  \r\n1.

We have visited Glasgow sick children’s a& e 3 times, Paisley out of hours 3 times and I have spoken with my GP at least twice a week. She has been given 6 different antibiotics but they did not seem to be having any effect. In mid June after finishing a 12 day course of antibiotics my daughter's condition was deteriorating I called my GP who referred her to The Sick Children's Hospital in Glasgow. She was examined by a doctor who gave us more antibiotics and sent her home after 40 minutes, I questioned why more was not being done for her as the antibiotics were not working! I then called my paediatrician's secretary the next morning who advised she would ask for me to receive a call back. The paediatrician called me the following day advising my daughter should be admitted to hospital for IV antibiotics and an ultrasound of her kidneys and bladder. We were admitted to Glasgow Sick Children’s Hospital ward 2C. My daughter had a cannula fitted by a trainee advanced nurse practitioner and a student nurse who were very professional and sympathetic towards my very upset daughter, they took their time and spoke us both through what was happening. They then took bloods and administrated IV antibiotics. We did not see a doctor until later that same night who informed me that by my daughters infection markers, the infection seemed to have travelled to her kidneys and she would have to stay in a few days for more IV antibiotics and blood tests to check her infection markers each day - this did not happen.We had a tough few days but most nurses were very helpful but unfortunately there was a minority who it seemed did not want to be there or help anyone. My daughter was examined by a doctor each morning, each doctor had a different opinion on what was happening with my daughter and I am still not clear as to why she is having these recurring UTI’s or when they will stop. Early the following week, we were spoken to by a doctor who gave us a lot of helpful information on my daughters bladder and how to hopefully prevent anymore infections, and discharged us with a 7 day course of oral antibiotics. After I spoke to the doctor I had asked a nurse if my daughter would have her bloods checked before we would leave to check her infection markers were lowering, the nurse was in my opinion very rude with a very bad attitude - tutted at me and told me that “if that was to happen a doctor would have told me”. The same nurse removed my daughters cannula and was again I feel very rude to me and my daughter, who as you can imagine was very upset, saying she was scared and instead of being sympathetic and helping my daughter this nurse proceeded to shout above my daughter telling her to \"stop screaming right now and let me do my job\" and she would see that it wasn’t sore. This only served to make my daughter fearful and her crying intensified. After the cannula was removed the raised voice continued, saying I told you so! I was very upset by the body language and attitude towards both of us and had to leave the hospital right away as I was very shook up and shocked at the whole situation! The scan that I was advised my daughter was to receive was not carried out, and we have been asked to attend the hospital again for the ultrasound to be done.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-06-15T20:03:05.6433333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-06-16T09:55:43.173","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":18},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/772480","id":"772480"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/772480/responses","id":"772480"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/772480/healthservices","id":"772480"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/772480/tags","id":"772480"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/c418h-gp-out-of-hours","id":"c418h-gp-out-of-hours","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sj9-children-paediatrics","id":"sj9-children-paediatrics","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sj9-general-practices","id":"sj9-general-practices","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/shocked","id":"shocked"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/antibiotics","id":"antibiotics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bladder","id":"bladder"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood","id":"blood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20tests","id":"blood tests"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/infection","id":"infection"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/iv%20antibiotics","id":"iv antibiotics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/most%20staff","id":"Most staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/one%20nurse","id":"one nurse"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scan","id":"scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attitude","id":"staff attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sympathetic","id":"sympathetic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tests","id":"tests"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ultrasound","id":"ultrasound"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/uti","id":"uti"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/conflicting%20opinions","id":"conflicting opinions"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/body%20language","id":"body language"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/772525","id":"772525"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/772532","id":"772532"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/772596","id":"772596"}]},{"id":772462,"author":"memberdx36","authorRoleId":6,"authorRole":"a staff member","title":"Hernia pain","body":"I attended A&E with pain from a hernia.

The hysteroscopist inspired confidence from the beginning and assured me that I could stop the process at any time if I found it too painful.  \r\nUltimately, I have no idea why I fretted so much. The procedure itself probably only took 5 minutes. Insertion of the hysteroscope was extremely uncomfortable, and although the 2 nurses who were assisting tried to distract me with chatter, I struggled to respond preferring to concentrate on deep breathing. The lead spotted this immediately and assured me that I didn't have to engage. The team was extremely helpful in talking me through every step of the way (helping me to do my best to relax, and even pointing out the \"landmarks\" that appeared on the screen ).

Removal of the hysteroscope was very quick after that and only mildly uncomfortable.  \r\nThe hysteroscopist spent time talking with me both before and afterwards and willingly answered all my questions.  \r\nI still have the results to come but I left the hospital skipping.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-06-14T21:07:34.7866667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-06-16T10:51:02.763","readBy":[{"name":"South Tees Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/772384","id":"772384"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/772384/responses","id":"772384"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/772384/healthservices","id":"772384"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/772384/tags","id":"772384"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rtr45_502","id":"RTR45_502","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nervous","id":"nervous"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bleeding","id":"bleeding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/empathy","id":"empathy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hysteroscopy","id":"hysteroscopy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/menopausal","id":"menopausal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/panic","id":"panic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/polyp","id":"polyp"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/positive","id":"positive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/post%20menopausal%20bleeding","id":"post menopausal bleeding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professional","id":"professional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/speediness","id":"speediness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/understanding","id":"understanding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vaginal","id":"vaginal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confidence","id":"confidence"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/no%20pressure","id":"no pressure"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/explanations","id":"explanations"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/experienced","id":"experienced"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/attentiveness","id":"attentiveness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ambience%20and%20facilities","id":"ambience and facilities"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/777025","id":"777025"}]},{"id":772303,"author":"Candy56","authorRoleId":1,"authorRole":"a carer","title":"Good communication is vital","body":"My father was admitted at the beginning of June for safeguarding reasons (a whole other story). He is I am told happy and well cared for and I had a call most weekdays asking whether his home was now ready for his return (it is). My unhappiness is that the attempt to return him a week or so later, failed (I believe because the re-ablement team asked that a mental health assessment be done on the ward, 9a) and communications did not happen.  \r\nI was not happy that a 4 hr window for hospital transport was planned but his care worker would not be present until 1755. The nurse I spoke to said this was unavoidable and that the ambulance staff would do their best to liaise with the care agency. I stressed that it was essential he be met and settled to avoid triggering delirium.  \r\nIt did not happen. I was not told. I missed a call which I assume was to inform me. However it was from the main switchboard and I had no idea who to ring to find out what was happening and did not get a further call.  \r\nMy point is that good communication is vital and not being heard or communicated with as the primary family carer who is shielding is guaranteed to undermine trust and cause emotional distress. I am aware that these are particularly difficult times but comms were of an acceptable standard up to this point. I have not had the promised phone call to update me. This is causing increasing levels of anxiety and distress.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-06-13T08:15:08.0533333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-06-16T10:56:06.533","readBy":[{"name":"North Bristol NHS Trust","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/772303","id":"772303"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/772303/responses","id":"772303"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/772303/healthservices","id":"772303"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/772303/tags","id":"772303"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rvj01_430","id":"RVJ01_430","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stressed","id":"stressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/assessment","id":"assessment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/safeguarding","id":"safeguarding"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/772533","id":"772533"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/772551","id":"772551"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/772579","id":"772579"}]},{"id":772436,"author":"Goldberry","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Ophthalmology needs a liaison nurse / officer","body":"I am a frequent flyer and have had excellent care from all the people that work in Aberdeen's Ophthalmology department, however, I feel there is a crucial role that is missing from the team - a liaison nurse or officer.
