My son cut his leg when out riding his bike and the person who provided first aid recommended going there to get it stitched. When we arrived the nurse from the ward had a look and said there was nothing she could do and if we wanted it stitched we would have to go to the BGH. The ‘minor injuries unit’ we were encouraged to attend could provide no more service than I could at home. NHS Borders try to encourage people to use Minor Injuries Units to take some pressure off the main A& E, but if that is going to work, I feel they need to staff them with people who can provide the service required. In my opinion a minor injuries unit should be able to clean and stitch a wound and give someone a tetanus shot at the very least.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-05-17T21:12:44.6366667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-05-20T08:32:41.607","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Borders","count":7}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/847134","id":"847134"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/847134/responses","id":"847134"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/847134/healthservices","id":"847134"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/847134/tags","id":"847134"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/b118h","id":"B118H","score":2},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/annoyed","id":"annoyed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disappointed","id":"disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frustrated","id":"frustrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/facilities","id":"facilities"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/leg","id":"leg"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/minor%20injuries","id":"minor injuries"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/skilled%20staff","id":"skilled staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tetanus","id":"tetanus"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/wound","id":"wound"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/service","id":"service"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/850834","id":"850834"}]},{"id":847081,"author":"Patient1985","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Lincoln hospital","body":"I was asked to come to a+e to get an admission to MEAU as requested by my consultant and during my time waiting in a+e the nurses made my experience unsettling as they keep saying the consultant isn't allowed to do this and I cant understand why you are here. I felt very uncomfortable, I wasn't waiting long for a bed on MEAU, but I felt during my time waiting the nurses and doctors were pointing and handing my letter around aggressively.  \r\nDuring my time on MEAU I was told not to unpack as I was going to Dixon ward, I waited until 8.30pm to be told they were waiting on a doctor to start my treatment, a few hours had passed and I was still waiting for treatment when a staff nurse came over to tell me we have requested a doctor, but they are busy. During this time I felt that another treatment was given in an aggressive way, my anxiety was worsening as I was confused with this awful hospitality. After mid-night a doctor came to start treatment, however the treatment I was suppose to be given was discussed properly before hand. I was told the treatment to be given was this or nothing, I was shocked by this and tried the treatment the doctor was offering at the time, but unfortunately the treatment was unsuccessful and was left in a state of tears, shaking and in pain. By this time I was very upset and wanted to discharge myself as I felt the whole experience I received was very poor. I asked to speak to a nurse and discuss my concerns and my worries and that I wanted to discharge myself, there was no advice given saying you need to stay for treatment or that we can discuss other treatments. They took my cannula out straight away and helped me leave. I have write a letter to my consultant about my concerns and upset.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-05-17T18:43:55.39","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-05-20T08:54:28.94","readBy":[{"name":"United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust","count":9}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/847081","id":"847081"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/847081/responses","id":"847081"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/847081/healthservices","id":"847081"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/847081/tags","id":"847081"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rwdda_180","id":"RWDDA_180","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rwdda-meau","id":"RWDDA-meau","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/aggressive","id":"aggressive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confused","id":"confused"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/shocked","id":"shocked"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20upset","id":"very upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/admission","id":"admission"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/experience","id":"experience"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/given%20up%20on","id":"given up on"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20attitude","id":"staff attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/uncomfortable","id":"uncomfortable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting%20time","id":"waiting time"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/849158","id":"849158"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/849171","id":"849171"}]},{"id":847135,"author":"fornaxjn93","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Excellent Service","body":"Every member of staff I came into contact with throughout my time in the hospital from the start to finish was outstanding!  \r\nThe COVID19 precautions and measures implemented are clear and effective throughout the hospital, but particularly in the Oral Surgery Unit.  \r\nReception staff are friendly and well organised. Very efficient that reception appeared to be asking all patients at the reception desk various questions about recent contact with Coronavirus. It didn’t take more than a minute to be checked in - thank you to Donna for arranging an x-ray with the radiography team on arrival into the department.  \r\nThe radiographer (whose name I don’t know, apologies) was excellent and very quick to call me into the room just off from the waiting room. I couldn’t have been waiting more than 5 minutes before being called in to take the necessary radiographs before seeing the Surgeon.  \r\nI would like to say a special thank you to the Oral Surgeon (Chris) and his Specialist Dental Nurse (Laura) for their time. I was slotted in as an urgent patient on their clinic this afternoon and I couldn’t be more grateful. The clinic assessment I received was extremely efficient, I felt I had time to address all my concerns. A full medical history was carried out and prompt diagnosis. I was given all of my treatment options and how it could be carried out by Chris. Laura was fantastic in her nursing manner, always anticipating and being prepared for the next request e.g. my prescription. Both Chris and Laura worked well together and wonderfully professional. THANK YOU BOTH SO SO MUCH for being incredibly kind.I have no concerns about returning for the second part of my treatment in the Oral Surgery Department. At this point I highly recommend as a place for great service (and I anticipate treatment likewise).

Mum was very anxious about her surgery but even more anxious about the process to be tested for Covid. We went to the drive through unit at the Woodside Road in Ballymena and it was so well organised- it is to be commended at the respect and efficiency of the team conducting the test and how calm they were conducting the tests.... which look extremely uncomfortable for someone, but when the staff are efficient and reassuring it makes all the difference. The only improvement would have been to advised us that the nurse would conduct the test.  \r\nMost of mums anxiety related to the fact she thought she would have to do it to herself and she wasn’t sure she could.  \r\nWe are very grateful for the service and delighted the results were negative (efficiently informed by text message 24hours later) and mum is safely in for surgery. As a family we are very grateful for the role this team is played","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-05-18T09:47:03.0133333","progress":"Made change","dateOfPublication":"2021-05-20T09:21:52.24","readBy":[{"name":"Northern Health and Social Care Trust","count":9},{"name":"Public Health Agency","count":2}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/847312","id":"847312"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/847312/responses","id":"847312"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/847312/healthservices","id":"847312"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/847312/tags","id":"847312"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt002-ctc","id":"ZT002-ctc","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxious","id":"anxious"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/delighted","id":"delighted"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/efficient","id":"efficient"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pre-assessment","id":"pre-assessment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/uncomfortable","id":"uncomfortable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/calm","id":"calm"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassuring","id":"reassuring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/covid-19%20test","id":"covid-19 test"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/848103","id":"848103"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/861954","id":"861954"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/874861","id":"874861"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/875194","id":"875194"}]},{"id":847321,"author":"julygr43","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"My care today.","body":"I had to take my son to out of hours today at Douglas street Hamilton.

Just this week alone 2 appointments failed. I attended Jordanthorpe for 2nd jab to find it closed, I had not been informed that the first app had been changed. On phoning doctors on I was informed I had been texted previously. Had I received a text on my mobile or a message by land line I would not have gone to Jordanthorpe clinic or got wet through due to the weather. Second appointment I attended after I had been told it was the Astra Zeneca vaccine, to be told by a nurse and those in charge at the clinic that it was Pfizer vaccine being given and that reception had been asked to phone that morning to tell me not to come in, as it had been noticed when they got the list of patients first thing that morning. My app was 11.50am and again no one bothered to contact me. So I have now got to attend for a 3rd time.  \r\nIt is no good pulling patients down about appointments they do not attend. Thats when you can get one, when reception is giving out wrong information or not even contacting people. I was informed by one receptionist in a rather abrupt tone that there are 20, 000 patients at the health centre.  \r\nIf thats the case then they should employ more receptionists to deal with phone calls and the receptionists to be properly trained so they give out the correct information then patients would not get frustrated and annoyed at the service they are getting. It cuts both ways and like it or not since the two surgeries have joined together the service has deteriorated big time. There are too many patients for one surgery and in this area there is not another surgery without travelling to Woodseats or Bradway.  \r\nI do not have a computer and have used my brothers, receptionists seemed to think everyone has a mobile or computer but this is not the case.  \r\nIf you complain you are made to feel that the staff are never in the wrong and the problem is you.

The nurses and support workers also were very helpful and it made the experience less stressful overall.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-05-19T10:17:17.9533333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-05-20T15:20:35.677","readBy":[{"name":"South Eastern Health and Social Care Trust","count":3}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/847700","id":"847700"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/847700/responses","id":"847700"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/847700/healthservices","id":"847700"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/847700/tags","id":"847700"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt004_07021-9","id":"zt004_07021-9","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxious","id":"anxious"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ambulatory%20care","id":"ambulatory care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood","id":"blood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood%20pressure","id":"blood pressure"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctors","id":"doctors"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/explaining","id":"explaining"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fantastic%20staff","id":"fantastic staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/high%20blood%20pressure","id":"high blood pressure"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/seen%20quickly","id":"seen quickly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support%20workers","id":"support workers"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/uncomfortable","id":"uncomfortable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20helpful","id":"very helpful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/waiting%20area","id":"waiting area"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fantastic","id":"fantastic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/patience","id":"patience"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/less%20stressful","id":"less stressful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/under%20pressure","id":"under pressure"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/850500","id":"850500"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/850935","id":"850935"}]},{"id":848230,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Very caring team","body":"In my recent experiences of pregnancy loss I've found the team to be patient, caring and supportive.
