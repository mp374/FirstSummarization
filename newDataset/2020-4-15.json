They explained to me that it can be sorted with a short laser procedure, for which my GP could refer me to my local services. As at the current time, the Covid-19 measures mean that most planned surgery has been suspended, the doctor kindly said that, as they weren't too busy at the time of my review, they could perform the procedure for me then and there. This was extraordinarily kind, as otherwise, I could have ended up waiting for many months to have things sorted. The procedure was carried out and my vision was restored to its former level.

Thankyou all so much for your wonderful care. &nbsp;","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-04-13T14:36:10.73","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-04-15T10:53:33.97","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Grampian","count":5},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":2},{"name":"Scottish Government","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/758018","id":"758018"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/758018/responses","id":"758018"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/758018/healthservices","id":"758018"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/758018/tags","id":"758018"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/n161h_501","id":"N161H_501","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/caring","id":"caring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helped","id":"helped"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/induction","id":"induction"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kind","id":"kind"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/labour","id":"labour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/midwives","id":"midwives"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/758805","id":"758805"}]},{"id":758136,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Excellent Practice","body":"My wife contacted the surgery this morning because I was experiencing symptoms I didn’t want to talk about or bother the surgery about due to Coronavirus .

With my little boy being back to back my pain was very intense and it led me and baby to be distressed and needing an epidural - but Katie listened to me and took my pain seriously doing everything she could to get me analgesia quickly. She was hands on and spent time really getting to know me and my partner and keeping us up to date the full time. I honestly couldn’t have had the experience I had without her - she is truly amazing at her job and is a huge asset to the team!  \r\nEveryone I met from the midwives to the domestics to the consultants to the anaesthetic team were amazing and friendly and worked hard to make sure I was comfortable and baby was safe. When I moved to ward 8 again the staff were lovely and helped make sure we were feeling comfortable during the time we had to spend without my partner. It was my birthday and they even arranged a birthday cake for me and sang happy birthday.

Diane was my named midwife and I would be seeing her for any of my appointments and hopefully my labour if she was on shift or on call when I go in, if not it could be her buddy.  \r\nDiane was a massive support throughout my pregnancy any questions or queries I had were not a an issue and I could send her a message and she would always reply.  \r\nAs it came to my labour, my waters went very early in the morning so I gave Dr Grays ward 3 a call, where I got asked if I could pop in for a check up, the lady I saw was reassuring and went through everything explaining when to come back in as I wasn't yet in active labour. When I went back into ward 3 later that day, I knew that Diane was on call that evening and felt more at ease knowing she would be my support throughout my labour. I had a few complications and before I knew it, I was having to be transferred through to Aberdeen.  \r\nDiane and Siham (student midwife) came with me in the ambulance which yet again put myself at ease knowing I would have them with me for support. As we got to Aberdeen they were both amazing and could not fault them especially as they were working together without any extra support from the Aberdeen midwife team. Anything I asked for eg, copious amounts of water jugs, heat packs etc was never an issue. Diane and Siham guided me through my labour and made sure everything was ok before they headed back to elgin at the end of their shift.  \r\nMy care after that was OK, not the best, I had a few different members of staff pop in and out, I had asked to use the bathroom and possibly an hour and a half or so later I was finally able to go after mentioning it a lot. No one had spoke to me about feeding my newborn baby and as a first time mum I didn't know when she would need to be fed etc. I didn't feel there was a lot of support once Diane and Siham had left until I got moved onto the ward where the midwives there seemed nice and helpful.  \r\nI cannot fault the new community midwife service that is being piloted, as a first time mum I loved the fact I felt I knew my midwife and had a connection with her instead of seeing several different midwifes who can only go by my medical notes. It definitely lowered my anxiety levels.  \r\nAnother big thank you to Diane and Siham from Dr Grays, you were both amazing and we could not fault you! Would love to have you for my next pregnancy.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-04-13T16:13:17.85","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-04-15T15:13:58.63","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Grampian","count":4},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":2},{"name":"Scottish Government","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/758025","id":"758025"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/758025/responses","id":"758025"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/758025/healthservices","id":"758025"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/758025/tags","id":"758025"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/n161h","id":"N161H","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/n411h_501","id":"N411H_501","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/labour","id":"labour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/midwives","id":"midwives"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pregnancy","id":"pregnancy"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/758189","id":"758189"}]},{"id":758109,"author":"snowpr53","authorRoleId":4,"authorRole":"a relative","title":"My dads visit to Station 4","body":"Dad was recently admitted to station 4. Its been a difficult week not being able to visit. But, I can honestly say that the staff looking after him have been nothing short of amazing. Amy, Nicola and Louise are a few of the names, a Male nurse too whose name I didnt catch, the ward clerkess for not getting annoyed at me phoning when they all have a job to do. Their communication has been excellent.  \r\nNurse Nicola had a bit of a job on her hands trying to persuade dad to stay for another 24hrs but she persevered knowing it was in his best interests, she could just as easily have taken the easy way out, thank you. Dad has been in station 4 many times and is known to the staff, each time is excellent but communication seemed more heightened and better this time.

On another occasion, after being told that I required a CT scan I received a phone call from the hospital two hours later booking me in for my scan the next morning.

My sister-in-law had told me what to expect. However I then met Stephanie, and what a relief, she explained all about the blue team and the best start programme,  \r\nhow it had all changed, and she was going to be the ONE midwife I would see through the whole pregnancy. I instantly became relaxed, Stephanie was so nice and was so open to what my needs and wants were, even if didn't know at the time. The whole pregnancy I had questions that she answered with no problem. I then discovered I had gestational diabetes, which threw a spanner in the works, but, Stephanie being Stephanie fought hard for us as we wanted as natural a birth as possible, in the CMU. Fast forward to the end of January and we had a big baby, with a tiring mum. So in the end we opted to be induced, I thought it would be plain sailing, it wasn't.  \r\nMy partner and I were in the hospital for three and a half days before we were taken to the labour suite. We both understood that there is a priority list, but it felt that we were being forgotten about. I kicked up, and asked for a section on the third day, to then be put off as 'baby and mum are doing fine'.  \r\nWe were taken to the labour ward early hours of Saturday, I was hooked up to the drip and laboured for about 14hours and then I was told I was going for an emergency section, we weren't sure why, and still to this day don't, our daughter arrived shortly after that. We spent 5days in hospital, as there was a slight infection marker that was high. It's all a bit of a blur, but all the midwifes were fantastic with us, putting my partner at ease as it all happened to fast.All in all I can't fault Stephanie, our midwife from the start (and someone I would hope to have as my midwife again). All the lovely midwife's we met between arriving and leaving including, Kelly, Lauren, Claire and all the midwifes up in the wards. The CMU and the best start programme is something to be envious of, it gives continuity, which builds trust, and trust keeps people relaxed, and focused on the then and now, rather than trying to remember what was said last time, I can't fault it, and I hope that it stays with a possibility to be taken up by different health boards across Scotland.","criticality":"mildly

My first birth, two years previously was in a large London hospital (natural birth, fast labour, 3rd degree tear).  \r\nI had a very positive experience giving birth in Peterhead, the midwives who assisted us were very experienced, professional and kind, and the facilities were incredible. We had a private room with birthing pool throughout, and one midwife who stayed with us through the whole labour, and a second midwife who joined for the pushing stage / delivery. From the start I felt very confident in the support I was getting from the midwife, who really listened to my preferences for my birth plan, and helped me to stay calm throughout. She managed to give me both the space to move at my own speed and do what felt instinctive, and also clear direction and guidance when I needed it, particularly in the final pushing stage.  \r\nI can’t say enough how grateful I am for the experience we had and the midwives who supported us, I wouldn’t change a thing about it.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-04-15T22:37:41.6233333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-04-16T12:36:34.33","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Grampian","count":3},{"name":"Healthcare Improvement Scotland","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/758180","id":"758180"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/758180/responses","id":"758180"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/758180/healthservices","id":"758180"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/758180/tags","id":"758180"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/n333h_501","id":"N333H_501","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/birth","id":"birth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/delivery","id":"delivery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/facilities","id":"facilities"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/giving%20birth","id":"giving birth"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kind","id":"kind"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/labour","id":"labour"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/midwives","id":"midwives"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professionalism","id":"professionalism"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/calm","id":"calm"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confident","id":"confident"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported","id":"supported"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/758245","id":"758245"}]},{"id":758183,"author":"ACelia","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Feeling neglected when I get so much support from medical staff","body":"I am on Stelera medication.

Being a mum is the hardest things I've ever done, but definitely the most rewarding.  \r\n7 years ago I suffered multiple miscarriages and 2 ectopic pregnancies resulting in only having one fallopian tube. To myself and my husbands surprise we went on to have 3 children, two boys and a beautiful girl! .  \r\nI felt guilty for not knowing how to manage my 3 children aged 4 and under and then I met Kath. Kath is a support worker (or as I like to call her, god in a dress) It was obvious when I first met Kath she wanted to help and completed a family star with me and it was only then that I fully understood how much id been struggling. My husband is a work away lorry driver and my boys have additional needs.  \r\nKath first suggested the programme and I was sceptical, id already done a 123 magic course and felt that it had failed (probably because I thought we were a lost cause and nothing would change, I just thought my children were naughty and out of control). Kath suggested the Solihull approach and once again I nodded my head and thought, just complete the course and then you can go back to solitary and ignore everybody, little did I know without realising Kath was becoming my go to person, emotionally and physically she brought me back to life.  \r\nI was at my lowest and at my wits end trying to spin all of these plates knowing one of the boys had autistic tendencies and the other ADHD. Two very very different individuals with a number of things that worked and didn't work for them personally.  \r\nEvery week Kath contacted me, spoke with me, guided me and ever so slowly put me in touch with people that could help me. I trusted her and as Kath said \"give it a try what else have you got to lose by trying a different technique\", she did it. I was put in touch with every single solitary person that could help myself and my family.  \r\nMonths on I now have the understanding, patience, knowledge and confidence to ensure my children have a solid routine that I am in control of not the other way around. I used to brand my children, and often say \"no im not trying that because one understands but the other doesn't\" when actually the programme taught me that if I didn't try how do I know? I now treat the children equally within family circumstances and give them the same boundaries and praise, whilst remembering they are still individuals.  \r\nKath was the one person in a thousand that I trust with my life. She never rushed me she let me cry, she told me every single day how amazing I was doing. She encouraged me when I saw her on courses I attended and most important she LISTENED. sometimes Kath didn't have the answers, but I can guarantee within 24 hours id have a phone call with a solution. She never forgot me, she always made me feel like we were the only family on her case load and always answered the phone.  \r\nMy marriage, mental health, children's health and happiness are right up back to where we were 3 years ago. I know not everyday will be perfect, and some days I will still want to cry or feel exhausted, but as kath taught me \"if you're exhausted, that means you're doing your absolute best, well done you\". Thank you to Kath, the only person who managed to drag me out of my hole, and not just for the current time but going forward. The children's centre have changed our whole family dynamic for the better and for that I'm forever grateful.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-04-16T10:57:59.9033333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2020-04-16T13:15:44.493","readBy":[{"name":"Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust","count":3},{"name":"The Miscarriage Association","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/758199","id":"758199"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/758199/responses","id":"758199"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/758199/healthservices","id":"758199"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/758199/tags","id":"758199"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rha20-ladybrook-cc","id":"rha20-ladybrook-cc","score":5},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rha20-titchfield-cc","id":"rha20-titchfield-cc","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/adhd","id":"adhd"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/autistic","id":"autistic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ectopic","id":"ectopic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/empathy","id":"empathy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/encouraged","id":"encouraged"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/guidance","id":"guidance"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helpful","id":"helpful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/important","id":"important"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/knowledge","id":"knowledge"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/life%20changing","id":"life changing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/understanding","id":"understanding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amazing","id":"amazing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confidence","id":"confidence"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/patience","id":"patience"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/trust","id":"Trust"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/contactable","id":"contactable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/like%20family","id":"like family"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/758213","id":"758213"}]},{"id":758205,"author":"C4ris","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Given the current climate the staff were fantastic","body":"Whilst out running this morning I felt a pop in my knee.

She was also diagnosed as covid 19 +ve on admission, but seemingly asymptomatic regarding this. Up until the point of admission mum was mobile with a rollator and not confused.  \r\nThroughout the stay it was incredibly difficult to find out what was happening, but on several occasions was advised that she has a very bad pressure sore on her L heel ( Grade 4) that needed review by the tissue viability team on the Tuesday.  \r\nOvernight on the Sunday, there appeared to be a change in plan and on contacting the ward mid afternoon on the Monday was advised that mum was going back to the care home. On asking if the home had the correct equipment to support mum was advised yes they did. On calling the home shortly afterwards and speaking with duty manager, was advised that they had not been told about the change in mums care needs, no mention of catheter, immobility or pressure sore. The manager rang the ward and when eventually they got through, mum had already left, and the person who answered said we don't discuss patients who are discharged and put the phone down.  \r\nThe manager and I discussed our various concerns regarding the situation, they call the District Nurse team, who visited the next day to make a full assessment, advising the discharge letter did not contain any of the above detail regarding mum's care needs or details of pressure sores, catheter or state of mobility.  \r\nThe situation seems very lacking. As a family member i was not advised on the change in plans, and feel the information provided to the care home was totally inadequate, and placing them in a very difficult position. Most of all it seems very unfair to my mum to have been on the receiving end. An irony made worse by the fact that she worked for the NHS for 40 years as nurse herself.  \r\n","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2020-04-15T11:08:37.4233333","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2020-04-16T13:23:07.967","readBy":[],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/758134","id":"758134"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/758134/responses","id":"758134"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/758134/healthservices","id":"758134"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/758134/tags","id":"758134"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rtrat_101","id":"RTRAT_101","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/frustrated","id":"frustrated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/catheter","id":"catheter"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication%20between%20services","id":"communication between services"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/heel","id":"heel"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hospital%20discharge","id":"hospital discharge"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/infection","id":"infection"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/integrated%20care","id":"integrated care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mobility","id":"mobility"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/powerless","id":"powerless"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pressure%20sore","id":"pressure sore"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/the%20change","id":"the change"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tissue%20viability","id":"tissue viability"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20concerned","id":"very concerned"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/family%20kept%20informed","id":"family kept informed"}]},{"id":758214,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Professionalism in time of crisis","body":"Our NHS are brilliant.

I was phoned the day before and the morning of my scan to make sure i didnt have corona symptoms. I was massively impressed with the process and ensuring I was kept safe at all times, i was provided with hand sanitizer at the clinic and was able to wear my mask during my scan. All the staff at the surgery and the guy who did my scan were class and i got told there and then what was wrong and what would happen moving forwards. I know a lot of places are closed and people are scared in\nthis difficult times, but scans still need doing and as i have found out all hospitals have stopped doing scans at the present time so i am really happy I could still have mine done with ScanAssure.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-04-05T13:06:12","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2020-04-16T13:49:40","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/758226","id":"758226"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/758226/responses","id":"758226"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/758226/healthservices","id":"758226"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/758226/tags","id":"758226"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/nfb","id":"NFB","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scared","id":"scared"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hand","id":"hand"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20believed","id":"not believed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/safe","id":"safe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scan","id":"scan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ultrasound","id":"ultrasound"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happy","id":"happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/impressed","id":"impressed"}]},{"id":758227,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Knee replacement","body":"I had a total knee replacement here and was absolutely terrified.From the moment I arrived at ward 3 at 7am from Carlisle I was put at ease.The care I had was superb nothing was too much trouble everyone was lovely.The food was great even the op itself wasn't as bad as I imagined and I had a lovely single room.I will probably need my other knee done in the future and I would not hesitate to return to Hexham.Thank you all you are all stars ","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2020-04-10T11:05:43","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2020-04-16T13:58:48","readBy":[{"name":"Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust","count":1}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/758227","id":"758227"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/758227/responses","id":"758227"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/758227/healthservices","id":"758227"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/758227/tags","id":"758227"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rtfdr","id":"RTFDR","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/terrified","id":"terrified"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/knee","id":"knee"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/knee%20replacement","id":"knee replacement"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/total%20knee%20replacement","id":"Total Knee Replacement"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/at%20ease","id":"at ease"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"}]},{"id":758230,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Great facility ","body":"Harold Wood is my local centre ad a great facility always been extremely satisfied with the service.
