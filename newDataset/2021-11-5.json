I started stealing my mums pain medication and i was taking a couple to a few strips a day. fast forward to when I was 15, i was drinking alcohol and taking ecstasy and acid constantly and even did it on school grounds - and still taking the prescription painkillers. I overdosed a lot and was in and out of hospital every month or so, one time having all my front teeth smashed out from getting in trouble under the influence. I got sectioned not longer after and was under section 2 of the mental health act (28 days in hospital), mainly from being out of control on xanax and alcohol but all the problems combined into one big mess. 1 month passes and i head back home, finally clean. I fell in love for the first time in my life and was in a relationship for several months. It ended because i found out i was being cheated on, drug and alcohol use ramped up once again… suicidal tendencies deteriorated and i felt like a threat to myself and others, completely lost. Fast forward to age 17, regularly taking opiates/opioids, and drinking somewhat heavily and definitely frequently and still taking acid. A year of that hell goes by and i tried to take my own life again over being rejected by a girl, now aged 18 and now diagnosed with bpd. Still drinking and taking dihydrocodeine, my best friend and my ex who cheated on me as stated here passed away, both accidental. Heartbroken and lost in life i kept drowning myself away in grief, met another girl almost a year later, together for a year and a few months and broke up due to complications (heavy on the dihydrocodeine at this point). After being severely betrayed and overall upset about life again, i decided it was time to get some help, now aged 20 - i opened up to my dad, mum and stepdad about what’s been going on and what my substance misuse was doing to me and how it’s affected my life from the start of using, very emotional time for all of us. being difficult to open up about it, a good friend of mine referred me to try Inclusion and I’ve felt a lot more stability and have been put on a treatment plan for my opiate addiction, with it being both maturity and support from inclusion i’ve felt a lot better with how i am with things (how to cope, having people to talk to who have share’d similar experiences) and i strongly recommend it if you need desperate help, the service response was better than most and the staff are understanding and experienced with mental health and substance misuse as a whole, great service for the ones out there who feel trapped in that pit of despair.

I have fed this back to various medical professionals (and others), however no real action has been taken.  \r\nI am supposed to be moving to a sheltered Housing facility on a permanent basis, as, (depending on who I talk to) I am told that  \r\n1.

I also feel that As a disabled male, paralysed from the waist since birth and having had a catastrophic stroke, it’s fair to say that I have been hugely let down by NHS Grampian as a whole.  \r\nThey have thus far refused my request to retrain my bowels by reintroducing a system which is proven to allow me to lead a normal life.  \r\nThere has (in my opinion) been a massive and shocking lack of a duty of care or anything even resembling a duty of care.  \r\nDecisions made now will have an incalculably impact on my future life and my mental well being, Potentially for the rest of my life,

service user","title":"Top class care in the community","body":"The Care nurses have been coming round on a daily basis for a six week period. When they were last here, they left this card asking me for my experiences.  \r\nI was referred to the local podiatrist because I have a right leg with no ankle in it, and my left leg is shorter then the right. I'd been attending for an orthesis as the foot doesn't bend. There the local podiatrist discovered I had an infection on the tip of the toe next to the big toe on my left foot. This seemed very very curious, as there was nothing I could see on the tip, but when the professionals say there is something there, you say ok and you listen to them. They recommended I go on antibiotics, by IV injection for six weeks, seven days a week.  \r\nSo, I took their advice, and thats the route we took. Every day for six weeks, thats 42 visits, we've had someone come here into my home and made up the antibiotics. They left us with the ingredients and mixed it up as needed each time, and made sure the line had been put in properly and had been cleared, by passing saline solution in presumably. They would then connect it up, and started to put in the antibiotics in, it went in over a five minute period. It wasn't a case of just pushing the injection in, it went in over a period of about three to five minutes, normally around 4.  \r\nI had 42 of these injections, and we were well pleased with the way it was done. From the first week, the staff were all very friendly, all very helpful, all very keen to monitor my blood samples on a weekly basis - every Monday they would take a sample and test it, it would come back on the Tuesday and they'd tell you yes, your blood levels are coming down. They started at, lets say, '20', then they'd tell you that it had gone down to say, '18', so moving in the right direction. This went on on a weekly basis.  \r\nThey also changed the line once, they had found it was leaking a very very little amount, and secondly put it in the other arm which made it even better because this gave me freedom to do exercises with my left arm.  \r\nSo this is where we are, 42 visits are over, giving feedback about the Belfast area County Down nurses. There is a similar service in Antrim, over the lough, but they only offer this in tablet form rather than by injection.  \r\nI kept a record of all the nurses who came and went. The vast majority of the nurses, 99% had all been in local hospitals and they had worked on wards for a number of years. They were all experienced nurses, and they brought that experience to the fore. They did say that they preferred this way, it allowed them to meet different types of people they could talk to, and they weren't being hurried along to answer the ringing of the bells, and people shouting. They much preferred it like this.  \r\nOn a couple of occasions, the nurse brought along an assistant. The assistant would do the job under the nurse's guidance. One is currently at Queens hospital Belfast with only a number of months to go, another was doing a degree through Open University, in their final year. Yet again, they were very helpful, very nice, very attentive. This is true for all of the staff I saw, nurses and assistants, they were all as good as each other.  \r\nI don't think any thing can be done better, though I have nothing much to compare it to. What I did receive was par excellent, I couldn't wish for better.  \r\nI thought the way they went about their work though, they were overrun by paperwork, it took up a good bit of their time. Say they were in for 30 minutes, probably more, say 45 minutes. Of that 45 minutes, at least 10 to 15 minutes were 1) preparing the injection, and 2) filling in all the details, who they were, my details, my blood pressure, pulse rate, all those things. All documenting what they were doing. They left me with one of those yellow sharps buckets for needles, so they wouldn't need to carry them away on a daily basis. All the stuff was put in there, and all the clothes they had were taken off, rolled up and put in a bag, and put straight into the normal bin. The hygiene of these people was particularly good, the first thing they would do when they came in was wash and dry their hands, it was all very good.  \r\nThey were all top class.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-11-02T12:42:23.6266667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-11-05T10:28:52.827","readBy":[{"name":"South Eastern Health and Social Care Trust","count":14}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/892304","id":"892304"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/892304/responses","id":"892304"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/892304/healthservices","id":"892304"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/892304/tags","id":"892304"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt004-dn-north-down","id":"zt004-dn-north-down","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt004-nd-podiatry","id":"ZT004-nd-podiatry","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/attentive","id":"attentive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helpful","id":"helpful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hygiene","id":"hygiene"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/podiatrist","id":"podiatrist"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/student%20nurses","id":"student nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/community%20nurses","id":"community nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/amount%20of%20paperwork","id":"amount of paperwork"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/894077","id":"894077"}]},{"id":892165,"author":"Mumc","authorRoleId":3,"authorRole":"a parent/guardian","title":"111 and Edinburgh Sick Kids Minor Injuries","body":"Called 111 this morning about my child's ankle as they couldn’t weight bear after a fall.

They treated me with great compassion and always listened to my concerns.  \r\nDue to Cancer surgery complications, I was diagnosed with Vocal chord paralysis resulting in total loss of vocal, acute shortness of breath and swallow issues which were extremely challenging. With extensive speech therapy for 6 months and truly amazing care, support and kindness shown to me from Jacqueline, Speech, language & Swallow therapist, who started my initial session by saying ' slow and steady wins the race' we worked so hard on my communication skills and in getting my vocal back to a level that I could chat again ... hugely important for me being someone who loves to talk and enjoy the craic!! However with continuous shortness of breath, limited depth or strength to my vocal ability, unable to do anything on exertion, and my overall quality of life - on discussion with my ENT consultant surgeon Mr McCaul, Catherine and Kate - Trachi nurse specialists we decided that the only fix to enhance my overall quality of life, to provide more air into my lungs and enhance my breathing and vocal ability was to have a Tracheostomy.A life changing and life adapting surgery which I had in October and which I am now recuperating from.All the nursing team in 1 West Elective Ward in Craigavon Area Hospital became my family for 10 days and showered me with so much care, support, help and kindness throughout my stay. It was definitely the little things that I will always remember .. from Valerie and Danielle washing my hair, to the hand holding and offering tissues on the more difficult days, to helping me, Gillian making me a cuppa, reading my hand writing on the chalk board and to Bronagh, Leah, Gina and Glaiza willing me on and telling me how well I was doing , showing me how to care for 'Talleluh' my Trachi and how all the team helped me so much. Catherine and Kate, Trachi nurse specialists always make me feel at ease and with their friendship, dedicated and ongoing care, attention & training pre and post surgery with my family and I, we feel much more confident to face this next chapter in my healing journey. With 3 surgeries during the Covid Pandemic thank you for all your caring support.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-11-02T09:48:39.9","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-11-05T11:10:50.043","readBy":[{"name":"Southern Health and Social Care Trust","count":5},{"name":"Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists (RCSLT)","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/892212","id":"892212"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/892212/responses","id":"892212"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/892212/healthservices","id":"892212"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/892212/tags","id":"892212"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_32024-ceaw","id":"ZT003_32024-ceaw","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003_33020_100","id":"ZT003_33020_100","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/zt003-dhho-ent","id":"zt003-dhho-ent","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/consultant","id":"consultant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kindness","id":"kindness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/speech%20therapy","id":"speech therapy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thyroidectomy","id":"Thyroidectomy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tracheostomy","id":"tracheostomy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassion","id":"compassion"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/confident","id":"confident"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cancer%20surgery","id":"cancer surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20at%20ease","id":"put at ease"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/895855","id":"895855"}]},{"id":888027,"author":"Hopalong Leith","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Persistent loss of hearing aids/teeth in hospital","body":"I am livid! My elderly father is back in Forth Valley Hospital for the 4th time this year. On every occasion, they've lost his teeth, or hearing aids or both. The score for this year is 1 bottom set of teeth missing, 1 top set of teeth missing (recovered after 2 weeks) and 4, possibly 6 hearing aids in total gone AWOL. Every time he goes in, they disappear without trace and the staff are totally unconcerned about it. It's of no more consequence to them than the loss of a biscuit - probably less so.  \r\nThey make no attempt to track them down until you kick up a considerable fuss and even then rarely succeed. There seems to be no concept in the minds of the nursing staff that an elderly man with dementia needs to be able to hear and to eat!!!! I actually had a nurse tell me this evening that my father wasn't eating well. She seemed rather surprised when I pointed out that this was because half his teeth were missing. Do I have to spell it out for them???  \r\nThe irony is that the hearing aids are national health ones, so their carelessness is costing their own employer a fortune - no wonder they can't afford more staff! What do I have to do to get them into the mindset that this is personal property and vital to the patient's welfare? The stress on relatives (in this case me) is HUGE without having to compensate for their lack of interest.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-10-19T21:06:26.1433333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-11-05T11:14:33.473","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Forth Valley","count":7}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/888027","id":"888027"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/888027/responses","id":"888027"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/888027/healthservices","id":"888027"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/888027/tags","id":"888027"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/forth-valley-royal-older","id":"forth-valley-royal-older","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/dementia","id":"dementia"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/elderly","id":"elderly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hearing","id":"hearing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/teeth","id":"teeth"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/893525","id":"893525"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/893658","id":"893658"}]},{"id":893237,"author":"JMM48","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Wonderful efficient service","body":"I was reluctant to attend A+E with my wrist injury as I know how busy and under pressure everyone is at the moment.

However...  \r\nWhilst I fully appreciate your support in giving those who would otherwise not have a voice, a way for their opinions to be heard, I feel that there is currently a complete lack of understanding on the part of some of your independent advocates when it comes to dealing with clients who have advanced Alzheimer's disease.  \r\nMy father is in a care home because I was no longer able to meet his needs at home. It was an extremely difficult decision for me to make but I am pleased with the care he receives and he is gradually settling.  \r\nHowever, since he has been contacted by your advocate he has become unsettled again. I have spoken to the care home and the advocate about this. Every time my dad has been visited by one of your advocates he is upset and becomes angry with myself and the care staff. Today I have had an awful visit with him as due to what the advocate said to him on a previous visit, my father is convinced he is going to live somewhere else. The only person who has mentioned this is your advocate. Not only is this not possible but both myself and your advocate are happy with the care he receives and my dad WAS quite settled.  \r\nI have spoken to your advocate asking what they said to my dad. Apparently they asked him a hypothetical question about where he would like to live. Who, in their right mind, would ask a person with advanced Alzheimer's a hypothetical question! My dad has no capacity to understand. I'm afraid to say that your advocate's presence is causing trouble for me and is upsetting and unsettling my dad. A person who lacks mental capacity easily becomes worried and unsettled and I feel your staff need training to recognise that. This has really unsettled my dad and made him angry with me. I have to say I am really upset. It's hard enough having to make the decision to let your parent go into a care home without this.  \r\nAs I said previously I appreciate that your service speaks up for and protects the vulnerable but please ensure they have the necessary training in how to do this in a productive manner.  \r\nMy dad is as happy as he can be in the circumstances. I only wish thinks could be different for him but they can't. Don't make this any harder for him or me please.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-10-28T14:45:07.5133333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-11-05T11:41:35.48","readBy":[{"name":"Citizens Advice Sheffield","count":1},{"name":"Healthwatch Sheffield","count":1},{"name":"NHS Sheffield ICB","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/890862","id":"890862"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/890862/responses","id":"890862"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/890862/healthservices","id":"890862"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/890862/tags","id":"890862"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sheffield-advocacy-hub","id":"sheffield-advocacy-hub","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20upset","id":"very upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/alzheimer's","id":"alzheimer's"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/understanding","id":"understanding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/spoken%20over","id":"spoken over"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/894040","id":"894040"}]},{"id":892765,"author":"januarydm37","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Figuring out the issue","body":"Reoccurring yeast infection symptoms causing stress and anxiety, doctors and nurses were amazing, figuring out the issue and offering solutions to help.

I went upstairs to get pair of shorts as it was nice day. No problems walking upstairs or any different feelings.  \r\nMy wife was going out in car to do usual stuff and said to me ‘there is a sandwich for you later and what are you going to do while I am away.  \r\nDon’t worry about me as I have some things to watch on television.  \r\nNext thing I knew I was waking up in ICU about 4 or 5 days later.  \r\nI had no idea what had happened but saw my wife at bedside. She had told me I had a heart attack which I could not fathom how. I knew I was struggling coz of tubes etc etc in my body..  \r\nSeemingly I had called ambulance myself, called my wife then opened front door to allow Paramedics access to me. I think I collapsed after that.  \r\nThe Paramedics (Leven ambulance crew) saved my life initially as they worked on me for about 15 mins to bring me back.  \r\nIn ICU I was very agitated and restless. But the staff were just brilliant with me and looked after me so well.  \r\nThey helped wash me and did all that I needed to make me comfortable. I was then due to go to Royal but unfortunately no bed for me. On the Friday my wife came to visit me and I said I am going to the Royal today at some point.  \r\nUnbeknown to me my wife did not like colour of me but obviously said nothing to me. I told my wife to go home because hopefully be away to royal. I went to toilet and came out and had this horrible pain in my chest/abdomen area. I shouted on nurse that I was struggling badly and immediately they hooked me up to machine and sprayed under my tongue.  \r\nThe head Doctor said this man needs to go to Edinburgh now.  \r\nAn ambulance was despatched and as quick as they could got me over to royal.  \r\nThrough the night I had a few more setbacks (heart attacks) and I was becoming quite scared. The nurses etc were brilliant with me reassuring me all was going to be ok. In the morning I was taken to the theatre and doctor  \r\nFitted a stent as I had one artery blocked. I can’t remember how long it took but I was back in recovery ward to have my breakfast. How FANTASTIC was that. My wife and son came in to see me and told me I was back to normal colour again.  \r\nThe weekend went quite quickly and was discharged on the Monday around dinner time.  \r\nOnce home the only problem I had was my rib cage and underneath were incredibly sore but I knew reason for that. I started going for small walks as quickly as I felt able to as I knew I needed strength back to better cope with what had happened. I am now on tablets to help cope with repair to heart etc. The follow up from NHS has been so good. Because of NHS I am alive today and that is a fact that cannot be argued with.  \r\n3 months on I am back working (Small part time job) and comfortably walking good distances and not out of breath.  \r\nI have no memory of initial setback so I have no bad dreams or thoughts at all.  \r\nOnce again I want to say to everyone involved in saving my life and looking after me so well in ambulance,hospital and after care a massive  \r\nTHANK YOU.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-11-03T10:44:23.1466667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-11-05T11:50:54.077","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Fife","count":12},{"name":"Scottish Ambulance Service","count":12},{"name":"NHS Lothian","count":7},{"name":"Fife Health & Social Care Partnership","count":2},{"name":"Scottish Government","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/892770","id":"892770"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/892770/responses","id":"892770"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/892770/healthservices","id":"892770"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/892770/tags","id":"892770"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/f704h-intensive-care-unit","id":"f704h-intensive-care-unit","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/s314h_320","id":"S314H_320","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/scot-ambulance","id":"scot-ambulance","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/aftercare","id":"aftercare"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cardiology","id":"cardiology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctors","id":"doctors"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/follow-up","id":"follow-up"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/heart%20attack","id":"heart attack"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/paramedics","id":"paramedics"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/grateful","id":"grateful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassuring","id":"reassuring"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/893495","id":"893495"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/893511","id":"893511"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/893603","id":"893603"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/894390","id":"894390"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/894401","id":"894401"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/894674","id":"894674"}]},{"id":892789,"author":"Bobby12Bobby","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Screening","body":"Good service.

I also lost half a stone in weight. Once I had recovered enough, I called 111 for advice, as I had been refused care at Worthing Hospital. 111 put me through to a doctor that knee about Adrenal problems, she said I needed emergency care and called an ambulance for me. When I arrived at A & E I was waiting for help for 3 hours. When a doctor saw me she said that A & E do not deal with Adrenal problems, and they could do nothing more for me.  \r\nI was distraught, and had to hobble home with my walking stick, in tears, after being unable to eat for days and being very unwell.  \r\nThe public need to be warned that if you are ill because of a NHS mistake, you could have all care denied. The Adrenal Crises that I suffer can cause coma or death. I am being abandoned to the point of possible death by the NHS, who actually caused my health problems – Multi Joint Hypertrophic arthritis, pre-diabetes, Bilateral Necrosis of hips, an Auto Immune disease and Periosteal Uptake (something related to bone lesions).  \r\nThe public should be warned that if they are damaged by an NHS mistake, they could be refused all care.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-10-28T15:28:04.3133333","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2021-11-05T11:53:47.723","readBy":[{"name":"Ulster University, MBBS (Medicine) 2021","count":2},{"name":"Healthwatch Sussex","count":1},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2021)","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/890879","id":"890879"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/890879/responses","id":"890879"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/890879/healthservices","id":"890879"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/890879/tags","id":"890879"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/ryr18_180","id":"RYR18_180","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/a&e%20waiting","id":"a&E waiting"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/adrenal","id":"adrenal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/arthritis","id":"arthritis"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/auto%20immune","id":"auto immune"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/bone","id":"bone"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/diabetes","id":"diabetes"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency","id":"emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hiv","id":"hiv"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/joint","id":"joint"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/weight","id":"weight"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/access%20to%20specialist%20services","id":"access to specialist services"}]},{"id":892813,"author":"Tessa77","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Confusion over an appointment","body":"I received an appointment letter to attend the hospital, then late yesterday I received a text telling me it would be a phone review.

Thank you all!  \r\nAnyone attending hospital, please be patient, respect others and you will be rewarded.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-11-03T12:17:50.43","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-11-05T12:02:43.617","readBy":[{"name":"NHS 24","count":28},{"name":"NHS Forth Valley","count":12}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/892823","id":"892823"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/892823/responses","id":"892823"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/892823/healthservices","id":"892823"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/892823/tags","id":"892823"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/forth-valley-royal-ae","id":"forth-valley-royal-ae","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/forth-valley-royal-cau","id":"forth-valley-royal-cau","score":5},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/forth-valley-royal-stroke-care","id":"forth-valley-royal-stroke-care","score":null},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/nhs24-111","id":"NHS24-111","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/attention","id":"attention"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctors","id":"doctors"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ward%20staff","id":"ward staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/calm","id":"calm"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/explanations","id":"explanations"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/893463","id":"893463"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/893483","id":"893483"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/893527","id":"893527"}]},{"id":892844,"author":"Helen20210","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Mental Health and working","body":"I have struggled with mental health due to trauma in my past growing up and what I went through.  \r\nI was abused as a child and then in my teens and young adult in very abusive relationships that left me traumatized and loss of self worth.  \r\nWork was always my escape and I have always been good at my job and I have a passion to help others because of my own traumas.3 years ago through over working and not looking after my mental health I had a break down and I struggled with my work, which I did not get help when I should have and just carried on, although my company could see I was unwell I could not see how I was deteriorating, in my work I lost all control of my emotions and felt with out work I had nothing as all I had done for 23 years was work and work hard long hours and days because I felt I had to do this to stop everything else in my life from going under.3 years ago when I had my break down I was ready to end everything due to not being supported at work and not looking after myself and my work was very stressful. I made the decision to move back to my home town and be closer to family, but with what had happened to me and the break down I struggled with my confidence in doing the job I have done for years and done well. So I went from one job to another not lasting more then 5 to 6 months before feeling too stressed and leaving, which did not help in my mental health and did not look good on my CV.I started to get support for my mental health which was the first time in 20 years and had to admit that I needed help. I was then assigned support and help, but covid hit. I would still go through jobs and not settle. until this summer I decided to go self employed and try and balance my life better I was given support from inclusion that helped me to understand that I can go self employed and still be supported and have a safety net just in case with universal credits whilst I develop my own career. Learning how to not put everything in one thing and learn to slow down and take care of my mental health as well as have a back up of support for when I had moments of worry and the whole what if, I had someone I can talk to my worries and what I may need help in and how to deal with my emotions in a positive way. Inclusion helped me in not to get a job as I could do that but in keeping myself in balance and continuity as this is what I needed and still a long way to go and I learnt is not a sprint I get there in time.Am I fully there.. no but in this time period I learnt that I don't have to work crazy hours and have all responsibility to be happy and content in what I am doing. but also I can be self employed and I can do this if I just have good balance.I am in therapy as well and I have to realise that I need to take time out and I have to be more mindful of when I need to rest and my mental health needs to be healthy and with out this then everything else will not work. but I need to be happy in my work, I now teach in which I have a passion for to help others in understanding in my limitations .No matter how old you are I believe we all need someone to listen to and not judge to hear our issues and not fix them but to know there is someone there that is there to listen. We don't all have the answers and we never have them but to have a support network and being able to say yeah I have Mental health but that does not defy who I am and what I can become Normal is an Illusion what is normal for a spider is Chaos for the fly","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-11-03T13:45:44.04","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-11-05T12:06:02.713","readBy":[{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2021)","count":2},{"name":"Midlands Partnership NHS Foundation Trust","count":4}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/892844","id":"892844"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/892844/responses","id":"892844"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/892844/healthservices","id":"892844"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/892844/tags","id":"892844"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rrex4-ips","id":"RREX4-ips","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff","id":"staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/therapy","id":"therapy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support%20network","id":"support network"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supported","id":"supported"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/894231","id":"894231"}]},{"id":892826,"author":"Barracuda","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"The attitude was not necessary","body":"Previously I have attended a sexual health clinic with no issues, it was in at another clinic and the person who spoke to me was lovely, I couldn't speak highly enough about her. I thought it would be the same experience in Coatbridge. Now firstly, the \"hello my name is...\" campaign wasn't emphasised in NHS Lanarkshire for nothing, the person I saw that night had no inclination to introduce themself and it felt like our consultation turned into an interrogation and was overall uncomfortable.  \r\nI get that there are medical reasons as to why other types of birth control can't be used if you're overweight or have been sexually active but there is a way to talk to someone, the eye rolls, sarcasm, overall couldn't be bothere. The attitude was not necessary.  \r\nNow I'm in my late 20's. Imagine if I was a young girl being introduced to these things received a consultation like that? My heart would break for them. It's their body and they should never feel like they've done something wrong by choosing to use birth control or by explaining how their body has reacted to types of bc. Also, when they ask questions like if you've been involved in domestic violence or experienced an eating disorder, how could you confide in someone like this? Two questions that could potentially save someone's life if the staff member actually seemed to care when they asked.  \r\nCredit where credit is due, they did apologise for a conversation that a doctor had with me over the phone as they didn't read all the factors before telling me my options, which turns out neither of them were suitable. And they did find me a suitable time and place to see a doctor in 12 weeks time.  \r\nI know nurses and healthcare staff can be burnt out with the pandemic and I appreciate all that they've went through, all I am trying to say is don't treat anyone like they are wasting your time, I am not a burden and I only seek help when I need it. Maybe reintroduce \"Hello my name is...\" to remind staff the importance.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-11-03T12:45:34.0033333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-11-05T12:10:38.827","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lanarkshire","count":7},{"name":"North Lanarkshire Health & Social Care Partnership","count":1},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2021)","count":1},{"name":"Partnership for Change","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/892826","id":"892826"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/892826/responses","id":"892826"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/892826/healthservices","id":"892826"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/892826/tags","id":"892826"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sl9-sexual-health","id":"SL9-Sexual-Health","score":2},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disappointed","id":"disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/uncomfortable","id":"uncomfortable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20manner","id":"staff manner"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/uncaring%20staff","id":"uncaring staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/misinformed","id":"misinformed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/attention%20to%20medical%20notes","id":"attention to medical notes"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/no%20introduction","id":"no introduction"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/apologised","id":"apologised"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/894752","id":"894752"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/898084","id":"898084"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/898171","id":"898171"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/898189","id":"898189"}]},{"id":892854,"author":"virgogd74","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"Made comfortable","body":"The staff at the endoscopy service were very professional and helpful.

The team were professional, calm and experienced and I feel very lucky to have had this amazing care today. Thank you all.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-11-03T19:02:01.6966667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-11-05T12:33:10.543","readBy":[{"name":"Royal Cornwall Hospitals NHS Trust","count":8}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/892958","id":"892958"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/892958/responses","id":"892958"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/892958/healthservices","id":"892958"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/892958/tags","id":"892958"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/ref12_330","id":"REF12_330","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctors","id":"doctors"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/kind","id":"kind"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professional","id":"professional"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgery","id":"surgery"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/calm","id":"calm"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/careful","id":"careful"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/893961","id":"893961"}]},{"id":892951,"author":"earthjf63","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"ADHD during remote Masters Studies","body":"Although the symptoms and characteristics were always present with myself over the years, the remote aspect of studying really highlighted them and the difficulties they present.  \r\nI was facing difficulties with my organisation, time management and concentration in general. This has always been a common thing for me, however due to the remote nature of my studies they felt more profound. I found myself being more restless and having more lapse in concentration than ever before. This in turn was affecting my workload and deadline schedules, online exams limited to only a couple of hours became a huge burden for me.  \r\nI contacted my university support team who referred me to their \"Do It Profiler\" assessment and then from those results I was referred to my local GP. After an appointment with my GP I was referred to the NeSS team.  \r\nAfter submitting the required forms and details from myself and immediate family members I was told to wait for the review. A while later my review was completed and I had my first meeting with Dr Gillott.  \r\nThe consultation with Dr Gillott helped me understand my situation better. Her high level of understanding and knowledge helped me open up about my issues and symptoms.  \r\nAlthough the waiting times are long, understandably due to the current climate and it being a relatively new service with high referrals.I'm happy that I'm now one step closer to getting the help and necessary treatment. I'm excited to see what happens next and how my daily life will change as well as my academics. Would definitely recommend the service but just know there is a waiting list and may take a while.","criticality":"minimally critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-11-03T18:00:37.31","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-11-05T12:35:46.39","readBy":[{"name":"Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust","count":4},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2021)","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/892951","id":"892951"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/892951/responses","id":"892951"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/892951/healthservices","id":"892951"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/892951/tags","id":"892951"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rha-idd-community-ndss","id":"rha-idd-community-ndss","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctor","id":"doctor"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helpful","id":"helpful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/long%20waiting%20list","id":"long waiting list"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/increased%20understanding","id":"increased understanding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/opening%20up","id":"opening up"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/new%20knowledge","id":"new knowledge"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/893507","id":"893507"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/893510","id":"893510"}]},{"id":893003,"author":"Poppy19","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"The care I received was excellent","body":"I have been seen in ED at Borders General Hospital today and the care I recieved was excellent .

To know that she is in safe hands is so comforting especially when visiting is restricted in Covid times.  \r\nWe are so grateful to the team with special thanks to Liz, Sophie, Carmella, Arietta and Minnie for taking time to update us and reassure us even though they are run off their feet. Briege (stroke nurse) was exceptional also. We honestly appreciate the time you took with us as a family which was so so helpful . We would also like to thank Dr Andrew for taking time to talk to us and update us on her progress.  \r\nThe Mental Health Liaison Service (MHLS) based in AAH have been exceptional throughout my Mother’s stay in A1. At a time where my Mother has experienced great fear and anxiety about her current situation and the future, the MHLS team has brought a great source of comfort to her and us as a family. Nothing was too much bother for this team. From ensuring my Mother had the treatment needed to help her along her journey, to providing daily reviews on the Ward and talking to us as a family , we will be forever grateful.

Initially we were allowed to use the scales to check her weight but after some time this stopped due to covid. However covid had been ongoing before we were even under the care of the health visitors.  \r\nShe got her 8 month check at 9 months old.  \r\nWe then got her 13-15 month check at 13 months but we had to go to the health visitor department rather than them coming to our home.  \r\nRecently I have tried to phone the health visiting team to discuss something I am worried about with my daughter to get a voice message that says due to sickness and annual leave no one will be in the office until Tuesday of next week (I phoned Monday the week prior). It continued to say to leave a message and someone will get back to you on their return. I am extremely frustrated you can't speak to anyone for over a week. There is no alternative number given. And I imagine they will have a lot of messages on their return so won't necessarily get back to mums on that day.  \r\nI find the lack of health visiting support very disappointing and feel there needs to be a major improvement in the service. Covid has stopped a lot of services but there is still new mums/worried mums/mums with a question who can't speak to anyone or see anyone. Reassurance from a health visitor would be so beneficial but it's just not there.

Triage were fantastic and completed a blood pressure profile, CTG, bloods and commenced me on medication to control my blood pressure. I was told to contact my community midwife the following day to request urgent consultant review.  \r\nThe following day I spoke to my community midwife, who requested consultant review. As I am a nurse, I was able to monitor my own blood pressure and observations daily. My consultant was due to call me on 3 days later as part of the telephone obstetric clinic, I did not receive a call.  \r\nOn Monday (4 days later) I had my routine midwifery appointment and was told that perhaps the consultant clinic ran over and that the consultant may call me in the next few days but to ensure I am not missed, I was added to todays obstetric consultant clinic for a call , which again, I have not received.  \r\nWhilst I have been monitoring my own blood pressure, I feel that there has been a lack of care from my consultant ( who at 34 weeks pregnant, I have yet to meet). I was told in June, that I will have a face to face appointment with my consultant at 35 weeks pregnant in order to discuss my request for C-Section- I as of yet have received no appointment for this either. I feel let down by my consultant and frustrated at the lack of communication, which is causing me undue stress and anxiety. I feel that I have been overlooked and that despite having a consultant led pregnancy, there has been no one leading my pregnancy care.","criticality":"mildly critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-11-04T19:02:08.2766667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-11-05T14:39:21.797","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lanarkshire","count":7},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2021)","count":1},{"name":"Partnership for Change","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/893270","id":"893270"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/893270/responses","id":"893270"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/893270/healthservices","id":"893270"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/893270/tags","id":"893270"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l308h_501","id":"L308H_501","score":3},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxious","id":"anxious"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stressed","id":"stressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/consultant","id":"consultant"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/overlooked","id":"overlooked"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/triage","id":"triage"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/894405","id":"894405"}]},{"id":893486,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Great Practice","body":"The management of the Flu vaccination on 28th was brilliant.

She was admitted to Ninewells ED around 11pm, where she had excellent care from the medical & nursing teams.  \r\nShe was moved to ward 9, trauma admissions in early hours of the morning. The staff who cared for her during her stay were excellent, caring and kind. She especially remembers a staff nurse called Ross who was on duty on the night shift. He was exceptionally thoughtful and kind, she wanted to mention how frightened she was and how much Ross reassured her, something which she will never forget. Although there were too many names to remember, all other staff on the ward - nursing and care, medical, AHP, students, housekeeping and domestic were friendly and professional too.  \r\nThe clinical care was excellent - mum especially appreciated the 'Sips till Send' initiative, being able to keep her mouth comfortable right up to the point of theatre made such a difference to her. I have a nursing background, and am aware of the Hip Fracture Standards. In addition to the benefit of Sips till Send, I particularly appreciated that mum had her surgical procedure within 14 hours of her fall and that her early mobilisation has contributed to her progress to date.  \r\nWe also wanted to mention how appreciative we are of the continued efforts of the hospital teams, despite the enduring difficult conditions arising from the pandemic situation.  \r\nAs her nominated visitor, it was very helpful for me to be able to book my visit slot earlier in the day to allow me to travel to & from my home in East Lothian.  \r\nAlso I want to mention a very kind young switchboard operator who so sensitively explained to me that my brother would not be able to go into ED to accompany mum, which saved him a fruitless late night journey.  \r\nAlthough a separate team, mum also wanted to thank the ambulance crews who took her to Ninewells and brought her home, who also were kind and highly professional.  \r\nThank you from mum and our family.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-11-04T19:49:56.7333333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-11-05T14:51:44.823","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Tayside","count":16},{"name":"Scottish Ambulance Service","count":10},{"name":"Ulster University, MBBS (Medicine) 2021","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/893281","id":"893281"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/893281/responses","id":"893281"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/893281/healthservices","id":"893281"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/893281/tags","id":"893281"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/scot-ambulance-emergency","id":"scot-ambulance-emergency","score":5},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/t101h_110","id":"T101H_110","score":5},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/t101h_180","id":"T101H_180","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/a&e%20staff","id":"A&E staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ambulance%20crew","id":"ambulance crew"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/clinical%20care","id":"Clinical Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/healthcare%20assistants","id":"healthcare assistants"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/housekeepers","id":"housekeepers"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/medical%20students","id":"medical students"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/night%20staff","id":"night staff"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses","id":"nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/switchboard","id":"switchboard"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/visiting","id":"visiting"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thankful","id":"Thankful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/a&e%20care","id":"A&E care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/domestics","id":"domestics"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/893516","id":"893516"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/894647","id":"894647"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/894652","id":"894652"}]},{"id":893294,"author":"Cookie03","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Friendly & professional service","body":"I had my coil replaced.

The first nurse who admitted me was super nice and listened to my worries.  \r\nI was then escorted round to the ward to be prepped for my scope. I was taken relatively quick. I was adamant I was getting sedation as I have done every other time. My endoscopist had got me ready for the procedure when then realised I hadn’t had my cannula inserted, it took approx 5 attempts but eventually couldn’t get a good vein for sedation so I had to get throat spray. I was absolutely terrified at the thought of this and knowing everything that would be happening around me. I was inconsolable but the endoscopists and two nurses were fantastic at calming me down. I had my throat spray administered and the procedure started a couple of seconds later, the procedure overall lasted about 3/4 minutes. It wasn’t the most pleasant experience but it was bearable and I made it through. I was super worried about gagging, retching or even vomiting but again the nurses/endoscopist told me this was normal and not to worry. I was laughing by the end of it.  \r\nI just want to say a huge thank you to them. They settled my fears, kept me so relaxed through everything and even saw me ugly cry at not getting sedation. I can’t fault them, if covid was not about I 10000% would have hugged them all. Thanks to them if I ever need another upper gastroscopy I know I can get throat spray and I will be ok.  \r\nPlease pass this message on to the three of them if you can.  \r\nAn overall pleasant experience after my melt down.  \r\nI will happily tell people if they need a scope to get it, the thought is a million times worse.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-11-04T00:16:07.5533333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-11-05T15:03:40.927","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Lanarkshire","count":6},{"name":"Imperial College, BSc Humanities, Philosophy & Law (2021)","count":1},{"name":"Partnership for Change","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/893008","id":"893008"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/893008/responses","id":"893008"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/893008/healthservices","id":"893008"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/893008/tags","id":"893008"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/l308h-endoscopy","id":"L308H-Endoscopy","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/apprehensive","id":"apprehensive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurse","id":"nurse"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/seen%20quickly","id":"seen quickly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/support","id":"support"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassuring","id":"reassuring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/listened%20to","id":"listened to"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/894309","id":"894309"}]},{"id":893433,"author":"filingst98","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Over the phone appointment","body":"Excellent service from the doctor very friendly and happy thank you","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2021-11-05T09:38:01.8266667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2021-11-05T15:04:28.71","readBy":[{"name":"Midlands Partnership NHS Foundation Trust","count":3}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/893433","id":"893433"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/893433/responses","id":"893433"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/893433/healthservices","id":"893433"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/893433/tags","id":"893433"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rrex4-sexual-health-services-nss","id":"rrex4-sexual-health-services-nss","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctor","id":"doctor"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/excellent","id":"excellent"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/friendly","id":"friendly"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/service","id":"service"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/897770","id":"897770"}]},{"id":893438,"author":"LesleyM","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Staff were so good with him","body":"Our little boy attended yesterday for a hernia repair. &nbsp;Staff were so good with him and very creative especially the nursing &amp;

May, who chatted with me for a while about everything & anything when there was a slight delay in getting me onto the operating bed. The anaesthetist & drs in those last few minutes before I went under, I remember you asking me my favourite tipple & me trying to tell you about the champagne id enjoyed a few nights before while viewing my recent wedding photos/video.  \r\nFelt like id drank 2 bottles when I woke up in recovery 😂 And finally the patient ladies who looked after me in those 3 hours bed rest making sure I was comfortable before leaving for home, even though I was the last one to leave.
