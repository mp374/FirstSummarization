I am so grateful for the time and attention the Doctor and his entire team have offered me, all within the surgery and via telephone consultations, without me having to visit the hospital.

I cannot speak highly enough about the care, efficiency and professionalism of the staff. I was x-rayed, fitted with a cannula, had bloods taken and delivered safely to EMU in just under 4 hours all with a smile, excellent.  I spent a night and day on the equally well run EMU and cannot speak highly enough of their care, especially how they seem to group patients with similar problems together.  My room mates and I coughed wheezed and spent 2 sleepless nights together in tolerance and harmony.  My shock therefore when i was moved to the so called respiratory ward Pearson was immense. The first bay contained exhausted looking patients forced to spend the entirety of their stay with a person who was shrieking the same name over and over at full volume and had been doing so for a week i was told.  The noise was intolerable and loud noises being one of my triggers, I confess to a meltdown and insisted i was going home.  The staff of this ward were amazing, and somehow managed to find me a bed in a quieter bay.  Their care for this anxiety panic attack sufferer was exemplary.  My respect for them grew as I watched them deal all night with the geriatric patient in my bay who's respiratory system seemed in fine order judging by the noise and abuse they inflicted on those caring for them.  I was told the geriatic wards were full and the patient was such a problem they'd been with them for several weeks.  During the rest of the night as I was cursed and insulted by other people in my bay every time i coughed or wheezed it became apparent that Pearson ward seems to be used as a dumping ground for patients not wanted by social services and other wards.  I was the only person coughing and wheezing in my bay and was shouted at and accused of having a nasty disease.  Seemed odd behaviour for supposed fellow respiratory patients.  The member of staff posted on a chair in the doorway to keep guard was another clue!  The staff and patients of this ward deserve better.  They couldn't even find a nebuliser machine for me...in a respiratory ward..really?  The computer system was refusing to accept the passwords allocated to agency staff, making them toothless and unable to log in. My eternal thanks to the staff member who supplied me with earplugs and mask so I could ignore the hurtful comments and all the staff who did their utmost to comfort me in the worst night I have ever had in hospital.  I hope your employers treat you better in the future.  Calow, Pearson ward is a disgrace, your staff and patients deserve better.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2023-08-01T03:09:54","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-08-01T08:10:42","readBy":[{"name":"Chesterfield Royal Hospital NHS Foundation Trust","count":6}],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1098968","id":"1098968"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1098968/responses","id":"1098968"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1098968/healthservices","id":"1098968"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1098968/tags","id":"1098968"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rfsda","id":"RFSDA","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/insulted","id":"insulted"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/abuse","id":"abuse"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/better","id":"better"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breathing","id":"breathing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/breathing%20problems","id":"breathing problems"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cough","id":"cough"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/exhausted","id":"exhausted"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/geriatric","id":"geriatric"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/group","id":"group"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nebuliser","id":"nebuliser"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/noise","id":"noise"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/panic","id":"panic"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/panic%20attack","id":"panic attack"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/respiratory","id":"respiratory"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/shock","id":"shock"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/sleepless","id":"sleepless"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/social%20services","id":"Social Services"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hope","id":"Hope"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doing%20well","id":"doing well"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thanks","id":"thanks"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/fine","id":"fine"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/no%20hope","id":"no hope"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1104214","id":"1104214"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1104276","id":"1104276"}]},{"id":1098975,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Was an excellent practice, but service has…","body":"I joined Queen Square several years ago after moving to Lancaster and always found it to be excellent, however, more recently I have found it impossible to get an appointment. As a disabled person with a long-term health condition, this is especially problematic. In addition, I found out recently that my named GP, who I had a good relationship with and who was very familiar with my medical history, had left the practice, however, I was not informed of this by Queen Square. This information was confirmed during a phone conversation when I called to check after reading something online. Only then was I told who my new named GP would be and this was someone I had never seen previously. As a result of my recent experiences with the practice, I have moved to another local practice with a better CQC rating. I hope Queen Square work out their appointment booking process and communication with patients, as I believe the remaining medical staff there are very good and they are being let down by both, as are their patients.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2023-08-01T04:02:56","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-08-01T08:11:36","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1098975","id":"1098975"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1098975/responses","id":"1098975"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1098975/healthservices","id":"1098975"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1098975/tags","id":"1098975"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/p81013","id":"P81013","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/let%20down","id":"let down"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/better","id":"better"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/communication","id":"communication"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disabled","id":"disabled"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/informed","id":"informed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20good","id":"not good"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hope","id":"Hope"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/no%20hope","id":"no hope"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1100249","id":"1100249"}]},{"id":1098973,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Very Helpful Doctor","body":"I visited the Doctor as I was worried about a symptom.\r\nAfter talking it over with her, and Doctor examining me, my mind was put to rest that everything was ok.\r\nThe Doctor was very nice with a charming manner.\r\nThank you!","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2023-08-01T05:53:01","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2023-08-01T08:13:18","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1098973","id":"1098973"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1098973/responses","id":"1098973"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1098973/healthservices","id":"1098973"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1098973/tags","id":"1098973"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/h84027","id":"H84027","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/worried","id":"worried"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20worried","id":"very worried"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/put%20off","id":"put off"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20worried","id":"not worried"}]},{"id":1097647,"author":"Simply01","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"The nurses were wonderful, kind and informative","body":"I went for oedema treatment at the Manor Park clinic.

This is a long standing issue and the newsletters will promote all the things they are doing e.g. a walking group, but there doesn’t seem to be a truly compassionate understanding of the issues which include holding in telephone queues with the constant, unpleasant reminders to hang up if you are not very ill,  switching off E-consult and a scarcity of routine appointments. These issues make it very stressful for patients to deal with the practice. For the most part, the individual staff are great but the three-surgery hub model doesn’t appear to be working, at least from a patient perspective. I wonder how they continue to get away with it - surely there is only so long they can say ‘we’re doing our best to improve’…this has been going on for years.

I am a bilateral hearing aid user and obviously needed to remove these for the scan. I felt really anxious about being in the scanner and not being able to hear anyone. I vocalised my concern to the radiographers present. I was given a pump style buzzer to use in an emergency. I was asked to test this to allow me to hear that someone was aware of any concern. I could not hear the buzzer on the test, I advised those present of this, I was told make sure you press it hard and it will be fine.  \r\nI was then given headphones to wear to listen to music to help minimise the noise of the machine. The music was extremely faint to me. Then when the radiographers spoke over the headphones by the time I recognised that there was a voice speaking they had finished talking, therefore unaware of what was being said to me. I felt alone, scared and isolated while in the machine. I feel that there was no recognition of my hearing disability and the heightened anxiety that is experienced when you can't hear the world around you. Adding a restricted space where you are confined within a head cage to this made the whole experience quite traumatic.  \r\nOnce the scan was over I informed the radiographer that I could not hear them. I was met with I was talking to you. I could not get out of the room quick enough. I needed to get to an environment where I felt safe and back in control of my surroundings.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-07-31T00:31:25.0866667","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-08-01T08:39:51.82","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde","count":6}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1098027","id":"1098027"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1098027/responses","id":"1098027"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1098027/healthservices","id":"1098027"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1098027/tags","id":"1098027"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/sj9qe-810","id":"sj9qe-810","score":3},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxious","id":"anxious"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disappointed","id":"disappointed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/isolated","id":"isolated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/scared","id":"scared"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/should%20listen","id":"Should listen"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/alone","id":"alone"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/awareness","id":"awareness"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disability","id":"disability"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hearing","id":"hearing"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/hearing%20aid","id":"hearing aid"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mri","id":"mri"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/out%20of%20control","id":"out of control"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/recognition","id":"recognition"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vulnerable","id":"vulnerable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassionate","id":"compassionate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/felt%20unsafe","id":"felt unsafe"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/buzzer%20system","id":"buzzer system"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/headphones","id":"headphones"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1101434","id":"1101434"}]},{"id":1097977,"author":"Heyyou32","authorRoleId":5,"authorRole":"a service user","title":"Unfair treatment in gynaecology","body":"Each time I came here I left feeling horrible & ignored.  \r\nI suffer with extreme heavy periods, I get large blood clots I struggle each month that I am on it. I finally got to see gynaecology. I struggle to talk sometimes so writing it on paper and giving it to the doctor helps me. I walked into the room & said I wrote what I struggle with down while trying to give them my phone. They shook their hand and said no no you read. At that point I got super anxious. Each time I tried to talk youd hear them mhh over me or they would talk over me & saying ohh so sorry to hear that ( I had only got a couple words in & never got the chance to finish). Their attitude had no care to me, I found it was really blunt and forced and felt no compassion, it felt very - shut up hurry up and leave - attitude.They said there’s nothing they can do to help me. Not even suggest any pain relief that could help with managing day to day . They said only way is to give you the coil. I told them I have vaganismis it’s painful to insert things how would you get it in? I asked what if I don’t like it how do you remove it they asked why would you want to do that? I said well what if I don’t like it so they said well why would you want to do that. I was silent so they replied with it’s in there for 6months. All I wanted to know was if I don’t like it being in me how would I get it removed, will it hurt? What’s the risks etc. There was no reassurance at all. They asked me what do I want if I didn’t want them to examine me but I’m sure others don’t want someone examining their private parts when you feel super uncomfortable talking to someone like that.I went to my doctor, turns out they shouldn’t of discharged me and I was meant to get it done in the hospital not the doctors. The gynaecologist appointment only lasted less than two minutes. My doctors appointment lasted longer & they were super reassuring & asked me if I had scans done or blood tests to make sure I didn’t have PCOS etc etc I felt the gynaecologist didn’t care.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-07-30T17:29:39.5833333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-08-01T08:42:10.453","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Forth Valley","count":7},{"name":"Scottish Government","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1097977","id":"1097977"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1097977/responses","id":"1097977"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1097977/healthservices","id":"1097977"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1097977/tags","id":"1097977"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/forth-valley-royal-gynae","id":"forth-valley-royal-gynae","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxious","id":"anxious"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/blood","id":"blood"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/care","id":"Care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/coil","id":"coil"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cysts","id":"cysts"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/discharge","id":"discharge"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/felt%20ignored","id":"felt ignored"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gp","id":"GP"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gp%20practice","id":"GP practice"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gynaecology","id":"gynaecology"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/interrupted","id":"interrupted"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/listens","id":"listens"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain%20relief","id":"pain relief"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/periods","id":"periods"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tests","id":"tests"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/treatment","id":"treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unsupported","id":"unsupported"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/uti","id":"uti"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/compassionate","id":"compassionate"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/reassuring","id":"reassuring"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/staff%20manner","id":"staff manner"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/absolutely%20awful","id":"absolutely awful"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1099122","id":"1099122"}]},{"id":1098251,"author":"woodpeckernb63","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"I am not used to mixed wards and was very near to tears","body":"I was recently admitted as an emergency to Ninewells Hospital. I was welcomed into the admission ward where I was shocked to find it was a mixed ward. I came to accept this as they were receiving and discharging all the time and the nurses were respectful of my feelings of discomfort with the mixture. The nursing care and indeed the care from the doctors and consultants were excellent.  \r\nI had to go to theatre for an operation and was moved to ward 8. I was ready to go to theatre in my gown and stockings. When I was moved through I was put into a bay of 5 men and myself. I was so upset, it was meal time and everyone was tucking into their tea. A nurse then came and told me to go to the toilet before theatre, I was mortified and had to come out of my curtains with all there men staring and in my gown tied at the back, and then had to ask where the toilets were. I know in this environment the nurses get used to mixed wards but I am not and was very near to tears.  \r\nMy journey to and from theatre were uneventful and I was glad to get my operation over.  \r\nOn wakening in the middle of the night after my op and not knowing where I was I was desperate for the toilet, I pressed my buzzer which I found out later was not working, luckily a nurse was passing, she helped me to the toilet but stopped to give me a row for shuffling my feet! I have a bladder condition and thought I was going to wet myself again a very upsetting experience.  \r\nThe next time I needed my buzzer was when I woke through the night and my heart was racing like a train, luckily a nurse heard my cries for help, this was deeply distressing for me, I thought I may have been having a heart attack.  \r\nThe nurses couldn’t be faulted on this occasion.  \r\nOther occasions the nurses were short and rough with patients and although I am always a champion of NHS, in my opinion some of these employees would be better elsewhere.  \r\nWhen I reported my buzzer not working the response from a nurse was it’s not been working for 2 months.","criticality":"moderately critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-07-31T13:29:57.9666667","progress":"Story heard","dateOfPublication":"2023-08-01T08:57:04.79","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Tayside","count":9}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1098251","id":"1098251"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1098251/responses","id":"1098251"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1098251/healthservices","id":"1098251"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1098251/tags","id":"1098251"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/t101h_100","id":"T101H_100","score":2},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/t101h_110_orth_surg","id":"T101H_110_orth_surg","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/embarrassed","id":"embarrassed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/shocked","id":"shocked"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/upset","id":"upset"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/consultants","id":"consultants"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/distressed","id":"distressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/doctors","id":"doctors"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/emergency","id":"emergency"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/excellent%20care","id":"excellent care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/gallbladder%20removal","id":"Gallbladder removal"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mixed%20wards","id":"mixed wards"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nursing%20care","id":"nursing care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/operation","id":"operation"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/rough%20treatment","id":"rough treatment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/some%20nurses","id":"some nurses"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/surgical%20gowns","id":"surgical gowns"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/tearful","id":"tearful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/theatre","id":"theatre"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/unheard","id":"unheard"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/vulnerable","id":"vulnerable"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/disorientated","id":"disorientated"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mortified","id":"mortified"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/nurses%20attitude","id":"nurses attitude"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/broken%20buzzer","id":"broken buzzer"}]},{"id":1099009,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Colonoscopy and gastroscope Examination","body":"I just want to thank the whole team for my excellent treatment yesterday, they had quite a job, and wasn’t without pain, but they were able to complete the procedure and I have nothing but praise for them.

I would recommend this programme.","criticality":null,"dateOfSubmission":"2023-08-01T08:06:09","progress":"Unread story","dateOfPublication":"2023-08-01T09:03:34","readBy":[],"source":"nhsc","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1099011","id":"1099011"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1099011/responses","id":"1099011"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1099011/healthservices","id":"1099011"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1099011/tags","id":"1099011"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/nne01","id":"NNE01","score":null},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxious","id":"anxious"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/worried","id":"worried"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/better","id":"better"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cbt","id":"cbt"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helped","id":"helped"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/test","id":"test"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/very%20worried","id":"very worried"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20worried","id":"not worried"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/in%20the%20way","id":"in the way"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/not%20great","id":"not great"}]},{"id":1099006,"author":null,"authorRoleId":null,"authorRole":null,"title":"Good doctors and nurses ","body":"Nightmare appointment system?\r\nYou need to be on the phone early and be able to wait alone time to get through?\r\nEven then they only have so many appointments!

My symptoms were hardly discussed. My symptoms are widespread and so painful and disruptive that I frequently think about suicide as a way of escaping. In desperation I asked if they were sure there is nothing wrong with my leg (it has the most persistent and strongest pain and has never even been x-rayed). They jabbed some locations on it, confirmed they hurt, then just announced its fine.  \r\nI was drawn a diagram, given a leaflet that I have read before, which referred me to websites I have visited before.  \r\nI was given a chance to ask questions at the end but I was upset and couldn't think of any.They said they would refer me for an assessment with the clinical psychologist in the pain service to see if they can offer anything that will help me learn to cope.I have a lot of pain. I don't have joint pain from an injury that didn't heal. I have pain in my left leg, in my hips, my upper back, inside of my lower back, pins and needles in my lower back, a right hand that tingles, a right leg and foot that tingles, and the left hand has started to as well. I have pain inside of my chest that makes it hard to breathe when it gets really bad. I have pain in my mid section. I have rolled around in pain instead of sleeping for the last 3 nights. When I get up I feel stingy and swollen.I have a full time job that it hurts to do, and I can't afford to work lessI have just been told that this pain is permanent, they don't even try to help you reduce the pain, just cope with it. It's like a life sentence.All they can do is send you to psychology. I could get no information about what might be offered to me, but had it in my head that surely, as a person in this much pain who has just been told its permanent, I might at least find out soon and be able to start trying. I am desperate to feel better.I received a letter shortly after the appointment to say I can't be given an appointment due to staffing problems. I reacted badly to this and decided to try and accept the fact that psychology wouldn't be able to help me anyway. I was angry that me and my pain matter so little that I was allowed to be left with no help at all (except my GP who is very understanding, but all they can do is prescribe pills that I am not convinced are working at all)I tried to cancel the appointment, I would rather be discharged without help and at least have the lack of help acknowledged and recorded somewhere, and do my best for myself rather than be left with the promise of help one day in the future.I was persuaded to stay on the list but I still don't know when I'll get an appointment, and if the outcome of that has a chance of being helpful.This is one of the country's leading clinics for the management of all forms of pain and they have offered me nothing.I am in the middle of a particularly bad flare over the last week that has consisted of 3 full nights of rolling around in agony instead of sleeping, and pain lasting throughout the day in several areas.

She missed all her High School transition events, end of term Leaver’s Party and saying goodbye to the school she’d been at for the last 7 years. Everyone thought the children were handling all this very well.  \r\nThey got to Secondary School then a few months in were hit with another Lockdown. More disruption and upheaval. My daughter, who had sailed through primary school without any dramas, was quietly hiding a secret.  \r\nOne day she came to me and said she thought she had OCD. I wondered what exactly she wanted me to do about it? Her dad is a tidy freak and I just assumed she was taking after him. I explained we all have a bit of OCD about things. She got cross with me and walked away. On several occasions since this first conversation she came to me but each time was being more concerned and adamant she wanted a doctor appointment to get an OCD diagnosis.  \r\nI was beginning to get frustrated with her. Then I asked her what made her think she needed to see a doctor. Her answer shocked me. She proceeded to tell me all the things she was doing that was affecting her life and thoughts. She was constantly fixing chairs, plumping cushions, moving coasters, ornaments and picture frames into certain positions, lining up table mats so they were centred and not squint. The list goes on. The worst one which was affecting her the most was the routine/ritual she had developed when doing the dishes. It took her 2 hours and if anything broke the routine she would start all over again! She had been masking all these rituals and I was really disappointed in myself for not noticing. I felt so guilty. These rituals were preventing her from going out and being with friends. She couldn’t leave the house until she had completed her rituals. She was always late to get places and often decided to cancel get-togethers.  \r\nWe contacted our GP who suggested speaking to Guidance. Together they decided a CAMHS referral would be beneficial for her.  \r\nWhen we had our first appointment I was impressed at how openly and maturely my daughter explained her situation, thoughts and feelings. Jill the nurse made us feel so relaxed and comfortable which really helped.  \r\nShe selected Lisa Ingram to work with my daughter as she was very experienced in Cognitive Behavioural Therapy and Jill felt they would get on well.  \r\nWhen we met Lisa we were instantly put at ease. She and my daughter clicked straight away. I felt pleased that my daughter was able to speak openly to Lisa. Lisa knew all the right things to say. She wrote very detailed notes about everything was saying to her. She really wanted to know all the details and get to know my daughter so she could give her the best help and advice possible.  \r\nWe started with weekly appointments which then moved to fortnightly. I went along to the first few meetings then my daughter was happy to see Lisa on her own.  \r\nLisa spoke to to guidance teacher as well and offered her some advice which would help my daughter through her anxieties over exams and tests at school. She did a couple of home visits as well to see how she behaved in her own environment and could witness some of the rituals.  \r\nShe came up with a plan and strategies to help with her compulsive thoughts, gave us books to read and recommended other books/journals to buy which would help.  \r\nMy daughter was very driven to help herself to get well and Lisa was the person who helped her get there. We can’t thank her enough!  \r\nMy daughter had 9 months of appointments with Lisa and I am astonished at what they achieved in such a relatively short space of time. We were sad when it was time to stop the appointments and lots of my daughter's rituals had begun to creep in again. I think she was a bit anxious about having to give up Lisa’s support. However, she knew she was ready to. She had lots of information and strategies she could refer back to.  \r\nIt has been almost 3 months since her last appointment and she is doing great. She still has moments where she is fixing the furniture and re-doing the dishes but it is not affecting her life the way it did before. She is seeing her friends lots more than before and she is so happy now.  \r\nOverall, we are delighted with the service we received from the CAMHS team. They have been a godsend and turned out lives around.  \r\nThank you Lisa.","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-07-29T00:44:58","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-08-01T10:07:26.617","readBy":[{"name":"NHS Tayside","count":7},{"name":"NHS Education for Scotland","count":1}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1097716","id":"1097716"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1097716/responses","id":"1097716"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1097716/healthservices","id":"1097716"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1097716/tags","id":"1097716"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/st9-community-services-co-pkop","id":"st9-community-services-co-pkop","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/advice","id":"advice"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/camhs","id":"camhs"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cognitive%20behavioural%20therapy","id":"cognitive behavioural therapy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/delighted","id":"delighted"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/great%20service","id":"great service"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/helpful","id":"helpful"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/information","id":"information"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/meetings","id":"meetings"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/ocd","id":"ocd"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/plan","id":"plan"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/strategies","id":"strategies"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/supportive","id":"supportive"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/understanding","id":"understanding"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/happy","id":"happy"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/impressed","id":"impressed"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/thank%20you","id":"thank you"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/weekly%20appointments","id":"Weekly appointments"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/experienced","id":"experienced"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1099028","id":"1099028"}]},{"id":1098132,"author":"26JM","authorRoleId":12,"authorRole":"the patient","title":"My Counselling Journey","body":"Following some serious health issues last December, I became angry, disappointed with life, my health, and my body. For years I had invested my time to maintain a healthy & positive lifestyle through a healthy diet, yoga, meditation, going to the gym, and doing things I enjoyed.  \r\nThis impact on my physical and mental health was the reason I developed anxiety, low mood, loss of confidence and no motivation. I was signed off work long term. This brought to the surface many past emotional stresses and pain. I felt stuck, lost in my own bubble, and I didn’t know how to move forward.  \r\nAfter my initial phone call following my referral to Inclusion Thurrock, I was referred for cognitive behaviour therapy. After my first session, it was decided this wasn’t the correct therapy for me at that time and I was referred for counselling therapy.  \r\nMy counselling journey started in February with James.  \r\nIt took me a lot of courage to reach out for help, feeling very unsure if this is what I needed. Looking back, I am so grateful to those who encouraged me to seek help.  \r\nMy therapy with James was face to face, he was kind, patient, professional and respectful, giving me the personal safe space, I needed to speak openly about my emotions, thoughts, fears, and grief. I was amazed how easily I was able to speak openly about these emotions to someone I didn’t know.  \r\nJames listened patiently, respected me throughout the whole process, understood and encouraged me to work with my emotions from within and giving me tools to help me explore to find a method I could work with.  \r\nAfter six months of counselling, I am grateful for every session which allowed me to offload fifty years of past trapped emotions and fears, including recent events. I feel I am now in place of peace, acceptance, and trust from within. There is still a journey ahead for my healing; my health, working with my emotions, not letting people use me or take me for granted and my aim now is to get back into the things I love to do and not to be afraid to try new things too.  \r\nI have confidence and strength to know I can do this and respect that ups and downs are part of the journey.  \r\nA big heartfelt thank you James for all his support in my journey to find my inner peace and confidence.  \r\n[Very happy with 'Seeing the whole me']  \r\n","criticality":"not critical","dateOfSubmission":"2023-07-31T10:15:11.3033333","progress":"Story has a response","dateOfPublication":"2023-08-01T10:08:57.937","readBy":[{"name":"Midlands Partnership NHS Foundation Trust","count":6}],"source":"co","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1098132","id":"1098132"},{"rel":"responses","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1098132/responses","id":"1098132"},{"rel":"healthservices","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1098132/healthservices","id":"1098132"},{"rel":"tags","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/opinions/1098132/tags","id":"1098132"},{"rel":"healthservice","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/healthservices/rrex4-inclusion-thurrock","id":"rrex4-inclusion-thurrock","score":5},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/anxiety","id":"anxiety"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/cbt","id":"cbt"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/counselling","id":"counselling"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/mental%20health","id":"mental health"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/pain","id":"pain"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/person%20centred%20care","id":"Person centred care"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/safe%20space","id":"safe space"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/face%20to%20face","id":"face to face"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/initial%20assessment","id":"initial assessment"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/stuck","id":"stuck"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/face%20to%20face%20counselling","id":"face to face counselling"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/therapeutic%20relationship","id":"therapeutic relationship"},{"rel":"tag","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/tags/professional%20counsellor","id":"professional counsellor"},{"rel":"response","href":"https://www.careopinion.org.uk/api/v2/responses/1105308","id":"1105308"}]},{"id":1097739,"author":"Twentytwo","authorRoleId":4,"authorRole":"a relative","title":"Excellent, compassionate, GP care","body":"My husband had been experiencing a number of health complaints over a 6 month period, seeing different doctors at our local GP service and generally not feeling well in himself.

I really liked this, as it made my daughter feel that she was being listened to, rather than let Mum do all the talking as usual. Avril carried out an ECG and took all my daughter's vital signs. She explained at each step exactly what she was doing and why this had to be done. She also gained my daughter's consent before carrying out any of these tasks. My daughter felt so at ease and was reassured the whole time.  \r\nWe then met with one of the Doctors ( we didn't catch her name) who again explained everything to my daughter, had a listen to her heart and had a quick chat about what could be the problem.

You cannot leave a message on the website out of hours so you a message first thing saying i can't make the call and the website says it make take three days to respond! They called me anyway from a withheld number, which for data protection reasons my phone does not accept, then send another text saying they would try later to which you cannot respond either!
